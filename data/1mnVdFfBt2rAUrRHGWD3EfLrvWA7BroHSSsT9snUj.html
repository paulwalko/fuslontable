<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> "The local press contributed to the climate by publishing a number of articles claiming that black men had sexually assaulted white women. Almost all of the reports were false. By September, many felt that a race riot would soon explode. On Saturday, September 22, white crowds along Decatur street, many of them drunk and inflamed by the headlines, began to gather. Someone shouted, "Kill the niggers," and soon the cry was running along the crowded streets. Some 10,000 men and boys in the mob began to search for African Americans. Whenever the whites would see one, someone would cry, "There is one of the black fiends"; minutes later, the "fiend" would be dead or beaten senseless. Among the many victims, a disabled man was chased down and beaten to death. The mob rampaged for several days before the militia restored order. Officially, 25 blacks and one white died. Unofficially, over 100 may have died." via PBS. N.B. A 13 y/o Walter White survived this riot (future head of the NAACP)<br>

NEGROES KILLED IN BATTLE WITH POLICE.
SOS FOR TROOPS.
Two negroes have been killed and several injured in a riot at coal mine near Birmingham (Alabama), in which crowd of 2,000 waged battle with the police. The crowd swept through the village, taking men from their homes 
and beating them. The situation became so serious that the sheriff requested the Governor of Alabama to send troops.The crowd of miners which did the pillaging informed the police that they were fired upon when they entered an area where the United Mine Workers were holding rally.On the other hand, the deputy sheriffs declare that the firing started when the "marchers" began forcing their way into the homes of 
negroes.—Reuter."

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> On October 16, 1876 a joint political meeting took place near Cainhoy, South Carolina, a small town located approximately nine miles northeast of Charleston.  A group of about one-hundred and fifty Democrats traveled to the site by steamboat and met their political opponents at “Brick Church.”  The leadership from both sides had agreed beforehand that participants would not bear arms at the meeting, but many of the Republicans, mindful of the sort of violence that had occurred previously in places like Hamburg, arrived to the meeting with their personal firearms.  When their leadership informed them that they were breaking protocol by carrying these weapons they stowed them nearby, some in a dilapidated vestry building on the premises and others in a stand of woods.  
    
The meeting commenced with a speech from the Democratic candidate for prosecuting attorney of the circuit, who was followed by W.J. McKinlay, a prominent Republican politician.  Shortly after McKinlay began speaking several young men from the Democratic congregation entered the old vestry and discovered the cache of weapons stored there.  They emerged from the structure and shouted warning to their comrades while McKinlay issued a similar warning to his fellow Republicans.  Seeing armed Democrats emerge from the vestry, many of the Republicans rushed to gather the weapons that they had stored in the nearby woods.  The scene quickly devolved into chaos as both sides feared the worst intentions from the other.  In the opening melee one elderly African American man was shot dead.  After this initial casualty the bulk of the Republican group returned from the woods with their weapons and quickly outflanked the Democrat’s position.  Many of the Democrats on the scene had carried sidearms to the meeting and returned fire, but they were ultimately driven from the field.  Between three and six of the white Democrats fell dead on the field before the firing ceased.  Members of Democratic controlled rifle clubs from Charleston quickly organized and arrived on the scene in force within a few hours.  Tensions remained high, but no more organized fighting took place and a small detachment of U.S. military forces arrived a few days later in order to maintain the tenuous peace.

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> On Wednesday September 6, 1876 the Democratic Hampton and Tilden Colored Club of Charleston held a political rally at Archer’s Hall, located at the corner of King and George streets.  J.R. Jenkins, an African American supporter of the gubernatorial ticket headed by General Wade Hampton III, delivered a strongly worded denunciation of the Republican faction.  Following the adjournment of the meeting several Republicans in the audience followed Jenkins, who was protected by a group of white men, north on King street until they reached St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church.  One of the white Democrats fired a pistol into the air in an attempt to disperse the crowd.  Instead, the gunshot drew more African American’s to the scene and fighting commenced.  The black Democrats were placed under the protection of U.S. Army troops who were stationed on the Citadel Green and the white Democrats dispersed.  The mob took control of King street, firing into a street car near Vanderhorst street and looting stores along King street between Warren and Cannon Streets. <br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> A fight between between local blacks and a group of white Navy sailors which began inside a pool hall spilled into the streets.  “In the ensuing melee, two white sailors, George Holloday and Jacob Cohen, shot and killed Isaac Doctor, an unarmed black man who was likely involved in the initial scuffle inside.”  Soon, a full scale riot broke out as the sailors chased the crowd of black men into Charleston’s segregated district. “As the mob gave chase down King and Meeting streets…sailors broke into two local shooting galleries and armed themselves with small caliber rifles and ammunition. Once fully armed, members of the mob fired indiscriminately into crowds of black people ducking into alleyways and scurrying for cover.” Reported to be “several thousand” strong, the mob controlled the downtown area by midnight.  By then, Black Charlestonians had armed themselves to fight back. The Marines were called in to restore order.

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Racial and Political Violence: "In Colfax, La., on Easter Sunday 1873, a mob of white insurgents, including ex-Confederate and Union soldiers, led an assault on the Grant Parish Courthouse, the center of civic life in the community, which was occupied and surrounded -- and defended -- by black citizens determined to safeguard the results of the state's most recent election. They, too, were armed, but they did not have the ammunition to outlast their foes, who, outflanking them, proceeded to mow down dozens of the courthouse's black defenders, even when they surrendered their weapons. The legal ramifications were as horrifying as the violence -- and certainly more enduring; in an altogether different kind of massacre, United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court tossed prosecutors' charges against the killers in favor of severely limiting the federal government's role in protecting the emancipated from racial targeting, especially at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan."<br>

The White League arrested several white Republicans and twenty African Americans, accusing them of planning a “Negro rebellion.” The whites’ rumors of uprising spread, attracting hundreds of heavily armed whites from nearby areas to Coushatta within two days.After being held hostage for days, the white prisoners agreed to resign and to leave the state. While traveling under guard, the prisoners were attacked by heavily armed whites determined to kill the men.  All six were killed.

The violence was not confined to this group; whites in Coushatta and the surrounding area beat, burned, and hanged several African Americans. By the end of the massacre, at least four African Americans and the six white officeholders were dead. Although a handful of men were arrested, no one was ever convicted for the murders."<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Political Violence: " A crowd of black men soon congregated outside which inevitably resulted in an altercation. After the meeting an African American shoved one of the members and tempers quickly escalated. Even though the man apologized, many white men had already drawn pistols. A scuffle ensued resulting in seven black men dead and two whites injured (NY Times, 11/5/1883, 1). The military arrived shortly there after and the crowd dispersed. Much damage had been done, but many of the effects of the riot were not apparent until after the elections. Whites patrolled the streets after the riot with shotguns in an attempt to keep fear and submission in the hearts of African-Americans. The propaganda proved effective when the polls were tallied as 31 of the 1,300 blacks registered to vote submitted ballots (Ayers/Willis, 142). The result was a landslide victory for the Democratic Party. This event also marked the end of the Readjuster era."<br>

A posse of 14 white men was formed the next day. Pope was defended at Rouse's Bridge by armed black men, and the whites retreated. By September 18, it was reported that 500-600 white men from Augusta and Columbia County, Georgia, members of rifle clubs or paramilitary groups, had entered the area. They attacked part of the Port Royal Railroad tracks, tearing up a portion. The white mobs spread out and killed freedmen working in fields, or hunted down or on the street.  The official record of Deputy US Marshalls indicated between 25 and 30 black men were killed; a New York Times reporter in an article stated as many as 100 blacks were killed in the conflicts, which extended to September 21, with several whites wounded. At the trial of some black men in May 1877, numerous witnesses testified that the whites had repeatedly said "they intended to carry the election [of 1876] if they had to wade in blood up to their saddle girths."<br>

<b>Date:</b> 28/09/1868<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> 100-300<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> "The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868. It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called The Landry Progress and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.

The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range."<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Summary from Blackpast.org: "On January 1, 1923 a massacre was carried out in the small, predominantly black town of Rosewood in Central Florida. The massacre was instigated by the rumor that a white woman, Fanny Taylor, had been sexually assaulted by a black man in her home in a nearby community.  A group of white men, believing this rapist to be a recently escaped convict named Jesse Hunter who was hiding in Rosewood, assembled to capture this man. Prior this event a series of incidents had stirred racial tensions within Rosewood.  During the previous winter of 1922 a white school teacher from Perry had been murdered and on New Years Eve of 1922 there was a Ku Klux Klan rally held in Gainesville, located not far away from Rosewood."<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> "With dynamite and acetylene torches, the leaders of the [white] mob worked on the vault until they opened it just before midnight. More than 5,000 people filled the courthouse yard and lined an adjacent street. The militia had left. Hughes's body was thrown from the vault, then dragged behind a car to the front of a drugstore in the black business section, where it was hanged from a tree. The store furnishings were used to fuel a fire under the hanging corpse. The mob also burned down the drugstore and other businesses in the area and prevented firemen from saving the burning buildings. By daybreak of May 10, most of the town's black businesses, as well as a residence, lay in ashes. Among the businesses burned were the offices of a dentist, a doctor, and a civil rights lawyer, William J. Durham. After the mob subsided, a detachment of militia went to the area and cut down Hughes's charred body. The owners of two black undertaking establishments that had been destroyed were offered Hughes's remains, but because they no longer had operable places of business, the remains were turned over to a white undertaker. Hughes's remains were buried on the morning of May 10 near the Grayson county farm."<br>

Subsequently, the governor of NC sent several contingents of troops into the region to try to maintain order. These deployments are no doubt detailed in state archives. As the result of the forced expulsions, there were reportedly no Blacks left in the county. People of African-American ancestry are a very small minority in the county today.<br>

<b>Date:</b> 04/07/1868<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> 2<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> 0 - Negative political impact – Democratic Party intimidated African American voters
<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Solomon George Washington Dill was a native of Kershaw, South Carolina and an active member of the Republican Party in the early days of Reconstruction.  After serving as a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention of 1868, Dill won a seat in the SC House of Representatives in April of that same year.  After serving only a few months in office, Dill was induced to run for county commissioner.  During the campaign, Dill suffered much abuse in the local press and received several threats on his life.  As a result, he asked several close friends to stand guard at his home on nights leading up to the June elections.  On the evening of June 4, 1868, however, the Dill homestead was left unguarded.  Eleven men crept quietly towards the home; Four of these men stopped along the road to ambush any of the legislator’s allies who might have come to his defense.  The remaining seven men reached Dill’s house and killed the legislator and Nester Ellison, an elderly man who kept watch over the home.  Dill’s wife was reportedly wounded. Whether she died is unknown. Over twenty individuals were arrested by military authorities in connection with the crime but despite a large amount of circumstantial evidence and witness testimony, none were convicted. Democratic Party officials continued such acts of intimidation to scare African Americans out of voting Republican.

<b>Fatalities:</b> 8+<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Following some minor disturbances in the summer of 1874, more pronounced violence broke out in Edgefield County in early 1875.  Matthew C. Butler, who had served as a major general of the Confederate calvary and was a prominent member of the county’s rifle and sabre clubs, urged the recently elected Reform governor Daniel H. Chamberlain to disarm Edgefield’s African American militia company.  Shortly thereafter an unnamed arsonist destroyed Butler’s home.  The accused perpetrator implicated Ned Tennant, the captain of Edgefield’s black militia company.  A manhunt ensued.  During the search, two African Americans were murdered and sporadic firefights took place between Tennant’s supporters and his pursuers.  Eventually, Tennant surrendered.  Shortly afterwards, Governor Chamberlain ordered the disarming of the militia and the disbanding of all other paramilitary groups in the county.  Tensions remained high; Later that year, following the death of a white woman (Lena Foster), six black men were arrested but were lynched by a mob of several hundred white men who removed them from the sheriff’s office.

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> The Ku Klux Klan formed in South Carolina shortly after the Constitutional Convention of 1868.  Chester County was a hotbed of Klan activity throughout the early 1870s, as Klansmen acted as the “terrorist arm of the Democratic party” and performed countless acts of intimidation and violence to prevent African Americans from exercising their political rights.  The most notable incident was the Chester Riot of 1871, where Klansmen and African American militia exchanged gunfire near a rail depot in Rock Hill. Following several days of battle, both sides agreed to a temporary truce.  Governor Scott responded to the incident by ordering all militia companies in the vicinity disarmed, which effectively removed any opposition to Klan activity.

<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Following a successful voter registration drive led by the Greenville NAACP, members of the Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement officers, many of whom were Klan members themselves, conducted a violent campaign of repression to maintain white supremacy. On September 24, in Fountain Inn, ten to fifteen carloads of heavily armed and robed Klansmen ransacked businesses and beat over twenty African Americans.  In nearby Simpsonville, a number of black men were beaten by Klansmen and a black woman was stripped of her clothes.  In early November, Klansmen pulled a black World War I veteran from his home, and for publicly criticizing the Klan, stripped him naked, lashed him mercilessly, and dumped his limp body on the front steps of the home of Joe Tolbert, the most prominent white Republican official in South Carolina. The leader of the voter registration drive, James Briar, barely escaped being victimized due to quick thinking by local blacks in Greenville who shuffled him from house to house throughout the week of November 15th.<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> On Friday, July 26, an unknown person attempted to set fire to an African American neighborhood in Georgetown.  The following evening, a tar barrel was set afire near the home of George Holland, a resident of unknown racial background. It seems that he was African American, however, because two black volunteer fire companies arrived to put out the blaze.  Later in the evening, “the cry of fire was raised almost simultaneously in a dozen different parts of the town.” A schoolhouse belonging to Mrs. Small was among the buildings razed to the ground.  Two of the fire companies that attempted to put out the blaze, the Heston and Star and Salamander, clashed openly in the streets.  There were no reported deaths but several of the volunteer firemen were badly beaten and stabbed.<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> On April 25, 1925, Aiken sheriff H.H. Howard received an allegedly anonymous tip that the Lowman family was selling whiskey.  Accompanied by three deputies, the sheriff made his way to the Lowman home armed, supposedly, with a legal search warrant to investigate.  As the four plainly dressed men approached the home, Sam Lowman, the black sharecropper who owned the home and surrounding farm, was away having cornmeal ground at the local mill.  His wife, Annie, and daughter, Bertha, were at work either inside the house or in the yard nearby.  Shortly after the law enforcement officers arrived, Lowman’s son, Demon, and nephew, Clarence, who had been plowing a field some one hundred yards away, ran to the house to assist the family members inside.  In the brief moments that followed, gunshots were exchanged.  Demon, Bertha, and Clarence were shot, and Sheriff Howard and Annie Lowman died. The three Lowman children, and two other family members were arrested and all five were promptly tried on charges of murder.  Demon, Clarence, and Bertha were each convicted.  The fourteen-year-old Clarence and his cousin Demon were sentenced to die and Bertha was sentenced to life in prison. Sam Lowman received a two-year sentence on the chain gang.  Later that month, N.J. Frederick, one of the only African American lawyers in SC and a leading NAACP official, defended the Lowmans and convinced the state Supreme Court to order a new trial.  On October 5, 1926, he won a directed verdict of “not guilty” for Demon Lowman and had poked holes in the cases against Clarence and Bertha. After the trial, Demon was arrested on new charges and the three Lowman youths were returned to the Aiken jail.  In the early morning hours, a white mob, assisted by Aiken deputies, removed them from the jail and drove them to an old tourist camp outside of Aiken where a large crowd had gathered.  After being ordered to line up and run, they were shot down by members of the mob.  Despite national outrage, the killers were never brought to justice.

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Following several nights of protests over the refusal of the All-Star Bowling Lanes to desegregate despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act four years earlier, Black students gathered for a peaceful protest on the campus of South Carolina State College in Orangeburg. During the protest, students lit a bonfire in the heart of the campus and continued to loudly call for change. Meanwhile, officers from the South Carolina highway patrol and National Guard soldiers moved towards campus. Later that evening, highway patrolmen converged on the campus to disperse the crowd and enable local firefighters to douse the flames. Accounts differ on what happened next but shortly after their arrival, the patrolmen opened fire on the students killing three and wounding twenty-seven.  Nine patrolmen were arrested and put on trial. All were acquitted. The only individual arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for his supposed role in the massacre was Cleveland Sellers, a longtime civil rights activist and former field organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

<b>Name:</b> Lynching of Frazier Baker<br>

<b>Date:</b> 22/02/1898<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> 2<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> 6<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> Shortly before one o’clock on the morning of February 22, 1898, Frazier Baker, an African-American postmaster in the predominantly white hamlet of Lake City, South Carolina, awoke to discover a raging fire deliberately set in back of the small wooden structure that housed both his family and the town’s post office.  Caught between the rising flames and a group of hostile and well-armed white men outside the building, Baker, his wife, and their six children sought unsuccessfully to douse the blaze.  As they prepared to flee the post office, the mob opened fire.  The postmaster was shot several times and collapsed, fatally wounded.  The barrage of gunfire continued unabated, and the three eldest Baker children were all seriously injured before they could escape through the open door into the night.  Baker’s wife Lavinia attempted to follow with her infant daughter Julia, but a bullet passed through her hand, killing the baby and tearing her from her mother’s arms.  Struck in the leg by a second bullet, Lavinia Baker collapsed beside the burning building.  The mob then dispersed as quietly as it had appeared.  As flames consumed the wooden structure, local African Americans drawn by the gunfire offered sanctuary in their homes to the new widow and her five surviving children. National protests, led by anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and George White, the last remaining Black Reconstruction-era Congressman, forced the federal government to investigate.  Thirteen men were arraigned and charged with conspiracy to violate Baker’s civil rights under the Enforcement Acts. Local whites, however, obstructed justice through perjury and appeals to the racial sensibilities of jurors. The result was a mistrial.

<b>Name:</b> Crittenden County Coup D'Etat<br>
<b>Location:</b> Crittenden County, Arkansas<br>
<b>Date:</b> 12/07/1888<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> unknown<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> In Crittenden County, Arkansas, Reconstruction ended when racist white Democrats in Marion forcibly expelled African American elected officials (County Judge Daniel Lewis, County Clerk David Ferguson, County Assessor J.R. Rooks and Arkansas State Representative Sandy S. Odom) at gunpoint of 50 Winchester rifles on July 12,1888.  It was called "The Revolution of 1888."  The group of white who forced them to leave stated:

"God damn you, you‘ve got to leave this county, this is a white man‘s government, and we are tired of negro dominance; we have been planning this for the past two years, and not more Negroes or Republicans shall hold office in this county."

At that time (in 1888), Republicans were the party of Lincoln and Democrats were the party of white supremacy, redemption from "Negro Rule", the Ku Klux Klan, and the White League, the Rifle Clubs, Red Shirts, or Knights of the White Camellia (other white supremacist groups).

When whites in Marion expelled Black leaders at gunpoint, it was right before the fall elections, so this resulted in the complete loss of Black political power and the complete rise of white power.  Not only were Black elected officials expelled at gunpoint, but so were prominent Black citizens. After this was complete, white Democrats passed the Election Law of 1891, a poll tax, secret ballots, and eventually the all-white primary (in 1905) which helped nullify the voting power of the super Black majority in Crittenden County.

This is how Black political power and representation was destroyed after Reconstruction in Crittenden County. It is clear from the historical record that Black people in Crittenden County did have political power, but through, terrorism, and taking the law into their hands, white people in Crittenden County stole African American's birthright. Legacy of 127 years.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Newberry, Florida<br>
<b>Date:</b> 19/08/1916<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> 8+<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> In 1916 Constable George Wynne, a white man, was shot and killed by a black man named Boisey Long near Newberry. This killing led to the largest known lynching in Florida history when as many as eight blacks were murdered by rampaging whites.  Boisey Long temporarily escaped, was later found, tried and hung.  Most of those who were lynched were hung from a huge "hanging tree" in a place that is stilled called Lynch Hammock, stands on Highway 24 right outside the city.  

Long's family members, including his pregnant wife Stella Young and unborn child, made up the majority of those lynched. Members of the powerful Dudley family were believed to have been involved in the mass killing as Constable Wynne was the brother of the matriarch of the Dudley family. Four of her sons and many other influential whites were photographed with the bodies of the victims.  The ropes used in the lynchings were reportedly tied in the kitchen of the Dudley farmhouse. The Dudley Farm is now a state park recreating early Florida Cracker life. <br>

<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> 1,000+<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> City and state officials in the Twin Cities chose to build the I-94 freeway straight up the middle of Saint Paul's Rondo neighborhood, displacing hundreds of people from their homes and destroying an entire Black commercial and cultural center, even though there was a more convenient route available that would displace nobody. 

In the 1930s, Rondo Avenue was at the heart of St. Paul's largest African American neighborhood that was displaced in the 1960s by freeway construction. African Americans whose families had lived in Minnesota for decades and others who were just arriving from the South made up a vibrant, vital community that was in many ways independent of the white society around it. The construction of I-94 shattered this tight-knit community, displaced thousands of African Americans into a racially segregated city and a discriminatory housing market, and erased a now-legendary neighborhood. While the construction of I-94 radically changed the landscape of the neighborhood, the community of Rondo still exists and its persistence and growth are celebrated through events like Rondo Days and the Jazz Festival.<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> The white laborers appear to have drank a good deal of whisky; whether the Negroes did is not known. Late in the evening a party of the latter went to the village on a serenading expedition, and on their return fell in with a party of Irish laborers, by whom they were violently assaulted. They succeeded in driving off their assailants, and retired to their own quarters.

The negroes immediately collected reinforcements, and, to the number of fifteen or twenty, advanced toward the scene of the first conflict. They were met near the same spot by a still larger party of Irishmen, armed with pistols and clubs, and, after a sharp fight, were discomfited, cut off from their quarters, and forced back to Mrs. Carter’s farm. Here they obtained further help, and then endeavored to save the cabins of the first party, which had been already attacked by their assailants. The Irish, better armed and more numerous, fired upon them across a deep cut and drove them off. The abandoned cabins were pillaged, and the money which the poor fellows had received the day before, and which was mostly deposited in sachels left in the quarters, was stolen. The Irishmen then fired the cabins, and immediately got into a row among themselves, during which one of the number, named Colls, was killed, and his body left near the cabins.

During the night the Irishmen collected reinforcements, and next morning renewed the fight. By spreading the report that Colls had been murdered by the negroes, they roused their countrymen to the utmost frenzy, and a party of about 150 made an attack on the Negroes on Mrs. Carter’s farm just at daybreak. 

Roused from sleep by the firing, the poor fellows fled in terror and confusion, closely pursued by the infuriated Irishmen. One of the negroes, Denis Powell, was shot, and left dying by the road. A portion of the fugitives sought refuge in the out-buildings around Mrs. Carter’s house, under the porch, and elsewhere about the premises. The Irish demanded admission to the house, and when the brave woman refused, they beat in the door. Just at that moment a poor old Negro was discovered crouching under the porch. He was immediately shot, dragged out, and beaten to death with clubs. After searching the premises, and finding no one, they retired. On their way back they found Powell still alive, and falling upon him, beat out his brains with clubs and stones. Spying another fugitive, Oscar Bruce, in the act of climbing a fence, they shot him down, and then, jumping upon his prostrate form, stamped it and beat it with clubs until it was unrecognizable as the remains of a human being.

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> "The negro population of this Maryland eastern shore town, where a negro was lynched less than a year ago, was driven from the streets tonight by angry white men , some of them armed with clubs , bricks and knives. Sheriff Luther Daugherty, who with several of his deputies hurried here from Crisfield, was told the trouble began when a negro and a white boy started to fight. A free-for-all fight developed attracting a hundred or more white persons and soon all negroes left the vicinity.

For a short time there was quiet on the main street of the village until some one was reported to have suggested that negroes spending Saturday night in Princess Anne be run out of town. Almost immediately the white men, most of them young, began marching through the streets. Negroes, leaving hats and coats in their hurry, fled in all directions.

A short while later they made a rush into negro towns and began scattering men, women, and children. Screaming and with blood on some of them , the negroes fled in all directions, on foot and in automobiles, the whites after them with fists, clubs, bricks, and knives.

Moss' dying words were, "Tell my people to go west -- there is no justice for them here."  According to anti-lynching Ida B. Wells in her speech "Lynch Law in All Its Phases":

"It was our first object lesson in the doctrine of white supremacy; an illustration of the South's cardinal principle no matter what the attainments, character or standing of an Afro-American, the laws of the South will not protect him against a white man. There was only one thing we could do, and a great determination seized the people to follow the advice of the martyred Moss, and "turn our faces to the West," whose laws protect all alike. The Free Speech supported ministers and leading business men advised the people to leave a community whose laws did not protect them. Hundreds left on foot to walk four hundred miles between Memphis and Oklahoma. A Baptist minister went to the territory, built a church, and took his entire congregation out in less than a month. Another minister sold his church and took his flock to California, and still another has settled in Kansas. In two months, six thousand persons had left the city and every branch of business began to feel this silent resentment of the outrage, and failure of the authorities to punish lynchers. There were a number of business failures and blocks of houses for rent."<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> "The Rev. W. D. Gillislee reports a reign of terror among the negroes of Lafayette and Taylor counties. He says their churches are being raided by white men, congregations dispersed and pastors driven away. Mr. Gillislee is the presiding elder of the Live Oak district of the Florida conference of the A. M. E. church. The counties mentioned are in his district, and he has recently returned from an attempt to fill his appointments. He was roughly treated. He says he was preaching in Lafayette County to a large congregation when a crowd of armed white men came into the church and stationed themselves near the pulpit. The leader asked Mr. Gillislee:

"How long do you expect to remain in this county and live?" 

Then the whites began to shoot, and Mr. Gillislee and the congregation ran out in a panic. Mr. Gillislee went to Branford, ten miles away, in Suane County. He made the trip in an hour. He then went to Taylor County, adjoining Lafayette on the west, but was again driven out. While preaching at night twenty white men came in and stationed themselves about the pulpit. Gillislee was greatly scared, but kept on preaching. Finally he said, "Sinners, you must be, born again or go to perdition." As he said that there was a howl from the white men and the mob shot out the lights. Mr. Gillislee and the negroes ran out, many being trampled upon."<br>

curled up from the road … over the tops of the trees.”30 Seeing the clouds of dust billow up in
the distance, black men fled to the woods.31 Over the next two weeks before the election, work
in the fields effectively came to a halt as dozens of men (and sometimes women and children)
took refuge in the thickly forested regions of the parish, returning to their homes only at night.32
One black political organizer recalled that the woods were so filled with men that it seemed “as
if a lot of sheep was running through the bushes.”33 Local blacks fled to the woods not to
organize or to reestablish community, but to find a sanctuary from the violence that claimed at
least forty and as many as seventy-five lives.<br>

<b>Name:</b> Millican "Riot"<br>
<b>Location:</b> Millican, Texas<br>
<b>Date:</b> 19/08/1868<br>
<b>Fatalities:</b> 2-100<br>
<b>Estimated No. of Refugees:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> The Millican Race Riot of 1868 was arguably largest “race riot” in Texas.  

&quot;The conflict occurred in Millican, Texas, a town located 15 miles from the Texas A&amp;M University campus.

Details remain unclear, but we believe that the Klan marched through Millican, a small central Texas town on the Houston and Central Texas Railroad, on during a Sunday church service led by Pastor George Brooks, a local Methodist preacher, former Union soldier, and Union League organizer. The worshiping armed freedmen fired on the rally, driving the Klan out of town. After the rally, George Brooks began a black militia of about 200 townspeople. The white community asked Nathan H. Randlett, local agent of the Freeman’s Bureau and former union infantry Captain, to stop the militia action, but Randlett refused.

Several confrontations occurred including the rumors of attempted lynchings. Some papers report that Miles Brown, a freedman, was rumored to be lynched, others that Andrew (or his brother William) Halliday or Holiday, a white son of a former large plantation owner, the target due to his supposed lynching of Brown. Several confrontations occurred including a march on the larger county seat of Bryan by a large group of armed blacks, which ended in an armed assault on the local black community and deaths of numerous black women, children, and men. Brooks was apparently tortured and killed. It is unclear if his body was recovered.

Apparently the local authorities called for a militia to be formed in Bryan and sent by train to put down the “mob.” Newspapers describe the militia as being taken from the bars and brothels in the middle of the day. Newspapers also report that the black militia surrounded the local black community, patrolling the edges of the area to protect the citizens.&quot;<br>

<b>Narrative/Notes:</b> An anti-housing integration riot.

Account of Bernard Kleina: "As we started marching, angry whites started spitting on me and the other marchers. Not being mentally prepared to accept this kind of degrading abuse, I told someone in the mob, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” as if I were ready to take onthe whole mob. (I think I may have been a little naïve at the time.) Then an older African-American man in front of me turned around and said, “Remember why you’re here, brother” and from that point on, I remained silent andwalked in solemn procession while rocks, bottles and cherry bombs were being thrown at us over the heads of the police who were “escorting” the marchers through the park. With the escort of reluctant police officers, it turned out to be the most brutal march I had ever been involved in. In fact, when we returned to our cars, we saw several pushed into the lagoon and others that were set on fire, turned over or damaged in some way. Ironically, there were only three cars not damaged. One was mine, and the other two were the police cars I had parked between. Had I arrived earlier, my car would have been damaged or destroyed like the others."<br>
