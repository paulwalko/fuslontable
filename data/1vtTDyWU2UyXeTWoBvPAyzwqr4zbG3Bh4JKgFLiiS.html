<b>Contamination background:</b> The Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant began producing small arms ammunition in 1942 during World War II. It was put back into service during the Korean and Vietnam wars, and some manufacturing activity continued through the early 2000s. A huge plume of groundwater below the site and extending to the south and west is contaminated primarily with chlorinated solvents, including  trichloroethylene or TCE.

An area around the plant was added to the state superfund list in 1984 because of groundwater contamination from volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Perfluorinated compounds are also a problem for groundwater at the site because of past disposal practices. Groundwater is pumped, treated, used fo cooling and other uses, treated again and then discharged into the Mississippi River.
