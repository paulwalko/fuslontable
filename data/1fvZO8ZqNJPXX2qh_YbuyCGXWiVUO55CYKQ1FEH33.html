<b>Summary:</b> (STABBING OCCURRED IN 2013; VICTIM DIED MARCH 8, 2015.) Prosecutors are reviewing a 2013 stabbing case after the victim's death in March was ruled a homicide. Angela Hallmon, now 54, was charged in December 2013 with stabbing her brother in the chest, leaving him in critical condition. Her brother, Edward Hallmon, died March 8 at a nursing home. He was 55. Police say Angela Hallmon stabbed her brother at their home in the 5300 block of Northland Avenue with a knife after an argument. Police said they were unable to find the knife and that Angela Hallmon cleaned up blood from the scene. She was charged with domestic assault, armed criminal action and evidence tampering. Prosecutors are awaiting documentation from the St. Louis Medical Examiner before deciding whether to upgrade charges.

Though Edward Hallmon was stabbed in 2013, city police are counting his death among this year's homicides, which is the department's policy. There have been 60 homicides so far this year, compared to 47 through May 8, 2014.<br>

<b>Type:</b> STABBING<br>
<b>Location:</b> 1805 Osage Parkway, Robertsville, Missouri<br>
<b>Summary:</b> A man who awoke to find an intruder with an ax in his Franklin County home Tuesday stabbed the intruder multiple times following an argument, authorities said. The intruder died later Tuesday at a hospital. He was identified as Eric M. Frazer, 38, of the 5000 block of Oak Grove Church Road in Robertsville. The two men were neighbors in a community near Lake Arrowhead, about 50 miles southwest of St. Louis. They used to party together, said Frazer's girlfriend, Cindie Spence. 

"They always hung out," Spence said. "They were like best friends." 

She said Frazer mowed the man's yard Monday night and later complained about him.

"Those two would always argue with each other," she said. Franklin County Sheriff Gary Toelke said the homeowner had shot and killed another intruder in self-defense in a similar incident in February. The homeowner was not charged in that case and Toelke said detectives were looking at whether the incidents were just bad luck.<br>

<b>Location:</b> 8440 Pershall Road, Hazelwood, Missouri<br>
<b>Summary:</b> With little to go on, the Major Case Squad disbanded Tuesday after exhausting its five-day investigation into the stabbing death of a man at a Hazelwood car wash.

The squad’s commander, Hazelwood Lt. Mike Brady, said the team of more than 20 investigators had run all the traps but had been thwarted by a video surveillance system that failed to capture the killing at the car wash and the lack of a detailed description of the killer or his vehicle.

The investigation will now be turned back over to Hazelwood police.

Brady said police believed they knew a motive and were calling the victim “truly innocent.”

Paul Suntra, 44, was stabbed once in the abdomen about 9 a.m. Friday at the Auto Wash at 8440 Pershall Road. He died at a hospital.

Suntra was the son of the Metro East couple who owns the car wash. He lived with his parents in the unincorporated Rosewood Heights area in Madison County.<br>

That third robbery victim had a handgun stored inside the truck, and as the robber held him at gunpoint, the victim fired one shot at the robber, striking him in the chest. The robber died at the scene, police said.

<b>Summary:</b> A man fatally shot inside a West County home had barged into the home after threatening his ex-girlfriend and another man, police say. Relatives of the man who was shot, however, are questioning the official account and say they want more investigation into how he ended up dead. The dead man, identified by police Wednesday as Joel Wright, 41, was shot once in the head about 10 p.m. Tuesday. The shooting was at a home in the 400 block of Chamberlin Drive. The home is in the city of Winchester, southwest of the intersection of Manchester and Sulphur Spring roads. The 31-year-old man who fired the fatal shot was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder but released after prosecutors declined to immediately charge him pending further information. His case could fall under Missouri’s “castle doctrine” law, which gives residents leeway in using deadly force in their homes.<br>

Westfall, who was critically injured in the attack, told police the name of the man who stabbed him in the chest. Later that day, that man came back with blood on his clothes and threatened to hurt Westfall’s younger brother, William, and burn the house down.

Hunott was again arrested and was charged Sunday in the attack on Brian Westfall. He has not been charged in connection with the fire.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> A St. Louis County resident was charged in the beating Tuesday of another man who later died. Ricky Vellmer, 56, of the 10100 block of Imperial Drive in unincorporated north St. Louis County, was charged with first-degree assault and jailed with bail set at $250,000 bail.

St. Louis County police say officers were called about 7 a.m. Wednesday to a house in the 1900 block of Chambers Road where Michael Johnson, 58, was struggling to breathe and not responding. He died at a hospital about 11:20 pm. Wednesday.

Charges against Vellmer may be amended after prosecutors review Johnson's autopsy.

Police say the men fought on Tuesday and Vellmer threw Johnson on the ground before punching and stomping him in the head. Johnson suffered severe internal brain hemorrhaging, officials said.

Police said Vellmer and Johnson were "acquaintances" but have not said what sparked the fight.

If Johnson's death is ruled a homicide, it would be St. Louis County's 62nd of the year. Last year, there were 37 homicides countywide.<br>

<b>Location:</b> St. Louis Avenue and East Prairie Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri<br>
<b>Summary:</b> Natasha Brown and about 100 family and friends gathered at a bus stop in the 3700 block of St. Louis Avenue to remember her cousin who was fatally shot there on Tuesday.

Brown, 30, of St. Louis, believes the killing of her cousin, Warren Marshall, 19, was a case of mistaken identity. As St. Louis homicide numbers continue to rise, she doesn’t want his death to be just another number. She wants the community to know he was a young man striving to do good for himself and his family.

Brown arrived with silver and blue balloons to release as she met with family members about 3 p.m. Saturday to remember Marshall. They placed teddy bears and other mementos near the stop sign where he died. Funeral arrangements are pending.<br>

<b>Type:</b> SHOOTING<br>
<b>Location:</b> 2600 Logan Street, Granite City, Illinois<br>
<b>Summary:</b> A man who crashed his car during a police chase — and was found to have the body of a slain man in the trunk — was charged Monday with first-degree murder, along with a woman accused of participating in the crime. George T. Tillman, 31, and Ashly S. Bonner, 26, had lured Roderick Taylor to Bonner’s home in Granite City to rob him, and shot and beat him in the process, officials said. The three worked at the same company, according to a statement from Madison County State’s Attorney Thomas Gibbons, and the defendants previously had been in a relationship. “This appears to be a carefully calculated crime. The victim died an unnecessary, violent death, at the hands of two people whom he shouldn’t have had any reason to believe would harm him,” Gibbons said. Taylor, 45, lived in Collinsville. Tillman is from Belleville. It was not explained what was taken in the robbery. The crime unraveled after Tillman, driving a maroon 2006 Cadillac, fled from a traffic stop by a Brooklyn officer on Illinois Route 3 about 7 p.m. Dec. 17. The Cadillac crashed at St. Clair Avenue and Collinsville Road in East St. Louis.<br>
