It has improved a lot. Valencia Street is nice. Most of my clients have already moved to Santa Rosa, San Rafael. I don’t live in the Mission... Latinos don’t really live here anymore, sometimes they come to my shop from Tracy, Fresno…Most people from this area, have already moved. Some people don’t like it because of the raise in rent, but for me, more housing is better, cleaner, there’s new people.  New apartments help improve the neighborhood overall.<br>

<b>Text:</b> Over here there isn’t a ton of construction, yet… There’s good reasons and bad reasons for new construction. Yeah, maybe we shouldn’t have gas station in residential area. But the bad is that it’s going to be expensive. With the construction in the neighborhood it has been a pain to find parking, if they build new construction they should be concerned about that. They change all the atmosphere in the neighborhood. Is it good? I don’t think so. Yes, it’s good if it will help a lot of people, but new renters aren’t going to be people who live here. We should stop it if it’s just to make money off the neighborhood.<br>

<b>Text:</b> If we’re talking about those cookie cutter condos, I don’t like those. I don’t have much positive to say about those. A lot of charm, a lot of character is stripped away by modern architecture--that’s even a compliment to call it modern! There’s plenty of housing being made for people who can spend a $100,000 a year on rent, but what about people who can’t afford that? Like a lot of other things, there’s not enough regulation--just like internet companies…. I don’t agree that adding more supply will be good for everyone. It’s just one specific demographic that gets served. It doesn’t support broader range of people, it limits diversity, when you get these big developments. I’ve been here for 20 years, came during first dot com boom, it’s always been expensive. It’s tricky for me because I benefit as business owner, but I don’t want to see more big developments.<br>

<b>Text:</b> I think a moratorium would be good. It’s a double-edged sword. Lack of housing can be an excuse [to continue building], but if there is nothing else but expensive housing? What they built by Arriba Juntos [Mission and 15th] ––impossible! And, for merchants [on the first floor] they have to be very elegant to rent there…  We can’t be told that building more is the answer, because there won’t be space anyways for poor people.

They come in, buy blocks of housing and invest --they take people out.  When building, the law says they have to give an indemnization to people [that are already living there], and then they prefer to not rent it out to people that will stay there long-term because then they have to ask them to leave. And, the commercial spaces below… no one is giving leases for longer than three years on Mission Street anymore.<br>

<b>Text:</b> I’m not opposed to building more, but a limit would be good as long as it doesn’t affect the neighborhood. To charge up to $5,000 a month? We are not millionaires. If tech is boosting all this, why don’t they build residential developments outside the city? When they do it here, everyone is affected. 
That they will build affordable housing where there is market rate is a hoax. First, they will raise the rent and once they build, we’ll be left out. These are corporations and they don’t care that Latinos are leaving and that the neighborhood is changing. As a merchant, I provide a good service and I have a lot of American [white] customers, about 80%. But, I already have that customer base, and not all the businesses can survive.<br>

<b>Text:</b> It’s okay that there is a limit in construction in neighborhoods where poor people live. To build more it’s a move from real estate developers to build more and create more housing...These are luxury apartments, and for what? Nobody born in San Francisco will be able to afford it. It’s for people that come from other countries, or other parts of the country that want to live here. And, there is no affordability, not even to buy. So, yes, there should be a moratorium. <br>

It’s already such an expensive place to live, it’s going to push us out. Let’s keep things simple. I like the old buildings. Look at the building on Mission and 22nd, it’s too new, why not make it look more like other things. We have these beautiful streets, trees, flowers. I don’t want big buildings like downtown.<br>

<b>Text:</b> If it’s a blanket moratorium, it can’t be a 100% good thing. There are things that’s needed in the neighborhood, a lot of unused buildings or disused properties. Obviously knocking down La Parilla to build new condos isn’t great. All that stuff that’s nasty, crappily built and super expensive it’s going to be rundown in 20 years… But moratorium seems like too much. There’s a lot of rundown buildings that need to be demolished and rebuilt, but it feels like some of the new stuff is just wanton construction. It’s just like in the late 90s when they were building all these live-work spaces for young, new people, but by the time they were done, everybody was gone… It just isn’t all black and white.

They should build more, when more competition grows price will go down. If we have more apartments there will be less pressure on market. Gentrification happens everywhere. A hundred years ago on Union Street, it wasn’t that fancy. I’m not afraid of changes… We need places to sleep, places to live. (Laughs) You won’t find many people like me!<br>

<b>Text:</b> Seems foolish to limit infrastructure. As the city grows, infrastructure has to grow with it. If you want to see the rainbow, you’ve got to see some rain… San Francisco is at an interesting juncture. If I live in a rent-controlled apartment and if I said no to new developments, it seems shortsighted. City can’t totally control what kind of apartments gets built. I understand things need to get built, but no one is going to build reasonably priced apartments, given how much things are going for. People are adverse to density, I understand, I benefit from it, but pulling out the stoppers doesn’t seem sustainable, it’s short sighted protectionism. I’ve always enjoyed 24th Street, because it strikes a balance, this place feels kind of steady. I don’t know if this will be helped by construction, but at the same time, no one should be able not to live where they want to live because there’s no housing.<br>
