<b>Bio:</b> I am a former federal employee with experience in public participation as required by law in various federal decision-making processes such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Adminstrative Procedures Act (APA), etc.  My federal experience also involves the effort to instill a participatory culture of management inside the federal agencies, e.g., the National Performance Review (a.k.a. "reinventing government") during the 1990's to make government "work better and cost less".  I was Moderator of REGO-L, the primary listserv (over 1,000 subscribers) on "reinventing government".<br>

<b>Bio:</b> Ever since the Reagan years I've experienced a greater divide not only between the haves and the have nots, but also simply people of different political philosophies. The right is going righter and the left, well they're staying in somewhat the same position but appear further to the left. I'm starting a blog where I bring people together to discuss important topics and focus on areas of agreement. We may disagree on how things get done, but there's much we agree on about what needs to be done.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I am a visual practitioner who uses visual processes to animate insightful conversation, help groups gain clarity around complex topics, reach shared understanding, and tell their stories in clear and compelling ways. I have graphically recorded meetings, conferences, workshops and dialogues for a wide variety of clients in all sectors since 2006 - including NCDD! More recently I have brought my visual skills to the design and facilitation of strategic planning, visioning, team-building, and community engagement meetings, and have begun an inquiry into the role of visuals in facilitating conflict. Whatever the context, I am happiest when I can help people navigate complex issues and chart a clear path forward in the most enjoyable, creative and fun ways possible. <br>

<b>Bio:</b> Jeff Prudhomme, Ph.D., is a Vice President and Fellow at the Interactivity Foundation (IF), a non-profit devoted to civic discussions that explore "what if…" The mission of the Interactivity Foundation is to use a facilitated process of collaborative and highly interactive discussions to help more people think of more aspects of complex areas of public concern and to think of more possibilities for our society to address these areas of public concern. Prudhomme's background is in philosophy and religious studies. He taught for a number of years (from higher education to elementary education) before joining IF. He sees his current work as a way to take philosophical thinking out of academia and into the world, to engage the thinking capacity of everyday citizens in exploring alternative possibilities for our society.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> Mary is a managing director of Gelinas James, Inc. and of Cascadia Center for Leadership. After more than 20 years working as a consultant to large organizations from all sectors, she moved to a rural area of Northern California ten years ago where she continues to enjoy consulting to smaller organizations and working to improve the quality and effectiveness of public process in the region. In this role she has or is working in the areas of land use, resource planning, economic development, mental health, and strategic planning for the second largest bay in northern California.

She is in the process of integrating the burgeoning knowledge about the mind and brain along with systems thinking into her approaches to public processes. She believes in the essential importance of effective public process to the health and future of democracy.  She is committed to making it more effective in rural areas where decisions are being made every day that affect whether rural areas will remain rural.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I decided to fulfill my dream to enroll in a Ph.D. program after working in the field for nearly 6 years. From July 2010 until May 2016, I worked as an international student advisor, visa advisor and program developer for the Semester at Sea education abroad program. When I began, I was also a full-time graduate student pursuing my MA in Higher Education and Student Affairs at the University of Virginia's Curry School. I was honored to work with international students and colleagues from all over the world that taught me invaluable lessons and reaffirmed my belief that education is key to global stability, understanding, and peace. My work helped me understand my calling as an educator-advocate.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> ICA is 50+ year old community development organization. Through reflection and research on the successes and setbacks of engaging communities in their own change making for 20+ years ICA distilled the process of facilitating consensus based outcomes for individuals, communities and organizations into distinct methods. 

These methods, known as the Technology of Participation (ToP®), are a collection of highly practical and participatory ways to engage groups regardless of size or topic. ToP facilitation methods enable groups to (1) engage in thoughtful and productive conversations, (2) develop common ground for working together, and (3) build effective short- and long-range plans. Basically, any time anyone needs to engage a group in decision making, ToP tools can help!<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I've been using Large Group Methods since the 1980s in a variety of for-profit, not-for-profit and government organizations. Some of my mentors in this area include Harrison Owen, Lisa Kimball and Billie Albans. I've worked with a wide range of interactive technologies and methods and usually take an eclectic approach to my work, tailoring methods and approaches to the client and the context. I have a deep interest in adaptive complex systems and see lots of connections between large group methods and complexity theory.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I want to study a wide variety of issues that make life better for us all, in a fairly unbiased manner that hears many points of view. I'm asking people with various views to have one-on-one conversations and educate me. I might later bring together other pairs of people who can have conversations and learn from each other. Amateur basis only - I earn money in an unrelated field. Suggestions welcome!<br>

<b>Bio500:</b> I want to study a wide variety of issues that make life better for us all, in a fairly unbiased manner that hears many points of view. I'm asking people with various views to have one-on-one conversations and educate me. I might later bring together other pairs of people who can have conversations and learn from each other. Amateur basis only - I earn money in an unrelated field. Suggestions welcome!<br>

<b>Bio:</b> Dr. Carolyn J. Lukensmeyer, Founder and President of AmericaSpeaks, has made her mark as an innovator in deliberative democracy, public administration, and organizational development. Concerns about the deep partisan divide in Washington and the growing disconnection between citizens and government across the country led Carolyn to launch AmericaSpeaks in 1995. Her goal is to develop new democratic practices that will strengthen citizen voice in public decision-making. Under Carolyn’s leadership, AmericaSpeaks has earned a national reputation as a leader in the field of deliberative democracy and democratic renewal. Prior to founding AmericaSpeaks, Carolyn served as Consultant to the White House Chief of Staff from November 1993 through June 1994. In this capacity she ensured that systematic thinking was part of the White House’s work on internal management issues and on government-wide reform. She also served as the Deputy Project Director for Management of the National Performance Review (NPR), Vice President Al Gore’s reinventing government task force. From 1986 to 1991, Carolyn served as Chief of Staff to Governor Richard F. Celeste of Ohio. She was both the first woman to serve in this capacity and, at the time of her appointment, the only Chief of Staff recruited from the professional management field.<br>

Before joining the Institute, Beem served as grants and communications manager for Next Door, a nonprofit organization dedicated to early childhood education in Milwaukee’s central city. Before that, he directed the Democracy and Community Program at the Johnson Foundation’s Wingspread Conference Center.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I am a recently retired certified municipal clerk elected to five terms as the city clerk of Torrance, California, a city of 150,000.  While I have not had the political mandate (no vote) I have had the best interests of the community throughout my career as the hands on caretaker of that position handling public records, elections, contracts and more.  I am starting to sense a disconnect in the community. Rather than looking from government outward - I am looking to see how, working together, we can energize and empower the community as a whole by creating our own conversations surrounding who we are and where we are going in the changing times to then take our dialogue back to the elected officials to show them where we think we need to go.  I am seeking road maps on how to inspire curiosity and a sense of real community in a very diverse population.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I am focused on helping individuals, groups and institutions improve the effectiveness of their collaboration around initiatives to further social justice, sustainable development and participatory democracy. Much of my work relates to Haiti where I lived and worked for 17 years, gaining direct experience of the macro and micro complexities related to socio-economic marginalization, development, governance and aid. I have helped design successful dialogue and collaborative action peace processes (Tracks 2-3) in the context of urban marginalization and violence. I am keenly interested in applying dialogue and deliberation tools to improve international development and humanitarian aid processes, as well as in supporting actors in Haiti in the use of these tools in pursuit of more inclusive local governance.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> I am a divorce &amp; family mediator and coparent educator, and the owner of Family Journey.  The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act requires separating and divorcing parents to attend a parenting class and, in the absence of a parenting agreement, work with a mediator to develop a parenting plan.  I developed the curricula for the Positive Coparenting program with the Parent Place of Springfield.

<b>Bio:</b> I was trained originally in personality psychology, counseling, and critical social theory. This led to projects attempting to trace the psychosocial impact of societal modernization on individuals and communities. My book Damaged Life: The Crisis of the Modern Psyche is one fruit of this work. Everything points to the critical role of dialogue in fostering deeper democracy. I am interested in collaborating in the creation and nourishment of spaces for public dialogue on divisive social issues. I hope to contribute to the development of the theoretical understanding of conditions that foster or hinder deeper dialogue and critical self-reflection. This theoretical work would be a precursor to shaping evaluation methods and practices for dialogue facilitation.<br>
