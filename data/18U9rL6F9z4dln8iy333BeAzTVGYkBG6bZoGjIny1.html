<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We have introduced Environmental Science 20 last year and I have had our first field study examining the Wood River Watershed and local reservoir.

I am hopeful that these two field studies will continue and develop an understanding within the students the importance of maintaining a healthy watershed for southern Saskatchewan.

Sponsored kits assist students and schools that can't afford much because of budgetary constraints. We have after school buses which costs our school double what the other high school in our area gets. This is because we cover a much larger area in our school board.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> The environmental chemistry unit requires students to examine water to determine its quality. We look at invertebrates and other chemicals in the water to determine its quality. I would like to start the unit by using the "Operation Water Pollution" kit, then use the "Operation Water Biology" kit to reinforce the concepts and bring Chemistry into the unit (which we study earlier in the year).

We have a trout release program with BC fisheries already in place. We collect water temperature. A few years ago we experienced heavy flooding. Many thought the lake was tainted because of the suspension of the particles in the water. There was quite a bit of testing done on the lake then. The lake is an integral part of the life and culture around here. Anything that would extend that knowledge would be great. Thanks.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We would like to be sponsored as a small school.  We have a small budget for projects such as this.  As the grade 8-12 Science teacher I will be spending a large amount of time teaching the students about present water issues and issues into the future. I think this would be an amazing opportunity for the students to have a hands-on practical experience that this program offers.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We are a small school in rural Yukon. Because we are small (50 students K-12), we do not get the kind of budget that larger schools get to purchase these kinds of amazing kits. This would help us bring a truly experiential and hands-on experience into the hands of students.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> It is imperative that our students understand the drinking water crisis; there is safe drinking water for all individuals across the globe. It is dire that our students not only are educated and gain a deeper understanding of the government regulations and their effectiveness/ineffectiveness toward safe drinking water, but also be able to evaluate the importance and apply laboratory techniques in the quantitative chemical analysis of water quality. With these kits, students will have the ability to conduct inquiry based learning, using the available technology or chemical tests, to detect the presence of inorganic substances in various samples of water. They will be able to not only evaluate and detect these inorganics in water samples, but also make predictions as to what natural process and/or human activities may have caused the results obtained.  This process will allow our students to be critical thinkers; gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of the impacts of natural and human-caused effects on the safety of our drinking water. I believe they have the potential to become citizens of change through this opportunity.

This can be effective in helping students to work on taking preventative measures in water pollution. This hands-on approach will be very engaging for students in grades 5-12 that can have the potential to create further scientific research for the students at CRCEC.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> I teach Oceans 11 to a group of rural students whose water at home mostly comes from their own private wells. The OWD kit allows them to understand the water testing process and to appreciate this vital resource. I have received one kit in the past (about 4 years ago) and it was a tremendous learning experience for my kids. I would love to do the testing with both of my oceans classes this year. Thanks.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Every year, classes in our school raise salmon and release the fry into Demamiel Creek which is on school property. We would like students to connect the health of the water with the health of salmon populations. Testing the water where the salmon are released would be a powerful  and memorable learning experience. We are also within walking distance of Sooke River which is connected to the Sooke Reservoir (the source of our drinking water). What better way to stress the importance of protecting our water resources than to have students test the water where they swim and catch fish. What a great learning experience!
