<b>Full name:</b> Aylesbury Vale District Council<br>
<b>Council:</b> Aylesbury Vale<br>
<b>Region:</b> South East<br>
<b>Theme:</b> Property /Land<br>
<b>Description:</b> Council as property developer, Aylesbury Vale District Council - We had identified two prime sites for development in the town centre and decided to become masters of our own destiny and manage the regeneration ourselves. One of the developments was what is now the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre.  It generates Â£2m per annum and a 12% yield to the council for an investment of Â£32m overall; with all risks devolved to the theatre's tenants, the Ambassador Group. The council also targeted Bucks New University's Aylesbury Vale Campus. With a local campus, we are taking rent, but also feeding local employers' talent needs, keeping skills in the area, creating a new generation of postgraduate professionals who will put down roots here. Today the council is extending its property development portfolio with Waterside North. It's currently a car park, but a multi-phase masterplan will see the site improved during 2016/17.<br>

As the business develops and takes on new income streams our contract will allow us to share our profits with the Authority.<br>

<b>Full name:</b> Portsmouth City Council<br>
<b>Council:</b> Portsmouth<br>
<b>Region:</b> South East<br>
<b>Theme:</b> Advertising/Sponsorship<br>
<b>Description:</b> The fundamental purpose of the The Income Generation Workstream is to empower Services to identify, investigate and realise potential sources of income. Advertising and sponsorship opportunities are now generating more than Â£200,000 per year for Portsmouth City Council, and have become a key consideration when planning new projects and events. As well as the more obvious sources of income, there have also been a number of successful new business ventures developed by the IGW. Income from filming and photography was negligible before 2012, despite the city's breadth of historic ships, forts, castles, tunnels and seascapes. On the back of Les Miserables filming in the Historic Dockyard, the IGW took a pro-active approach to marketing the city as a film-friendly destination. A new brochure and location library were developed, links were made with creative agencies, and relationships built with location scouts and production companies. The results were almost immediate, and since August 2012 there have been more than 90 different projects undertaken in the city, ranging from low budget student films to action thrillers and music videos. The income received from filming provides a welcome addition to the Council's budget, but more significant is the money spent in the local economy by film crews of 200 plus staying in local hotels and working in the area, and tourists visiting locations they have seen on screen.<br>

<b>Theme:</b> Housing<br>
<b>Description:</b> Housing, Richmondshire District Council - The majority of affordable housing in the district is currently delivered via Section 106 planning agreements.  The council have sought to change the traditional delivery model (which revolves around a Housing Association purchasing s106 properties and then converting them into affordable housing).  The council have now moved to a model where they purchase a number of s106 properties and then market them.  In essence, the council takes up the role of a developer.  Under this model the purchaser would see a 30% reduction in the market value, paying Â£112,000 for outright ownership and the council would generate a receipt of Â£39,000 per property once legal and marketing costs had been deducted.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Services to schools, Wirral - we currently operates commercial activities in a range of diverse sectors including, leisure, theatre events, garden waste and services to schools through a Community Interest Company (Edsential). The Council has also created Wirral Evolutions. This is an example of a local authority trading company, and is very much in line with a developing trend in local government of more Council owned trading companies. As trading bodies, they can provide their services to a much wider market than a council department. Local authority companies represent alternative service delivery vehicles and exist alongside in-house delivery, trusts, social enterprises, outsourcing and other delivery models, but with particular emphasis on the concept of trading. The advantages of such operations are that a local authority can only enter into trading in the wider commercial market through a company. This strategy will provide a structured framework for greater commercial activity.<br>

The acquisition of the Winter Gardens included an interim management contract for the existing operator to continue running Â the complex for 4 years following purchase, so as to allow the Council to establish longer term arrangements.

<b>Description:</b> Finance, Durham CC - Finance Durham will operate on a commercial basis providing risk finance to Durham companies in the form of debt, equity and mezzanine. Â The intention is to run the fund as an evergreen fund, meaning that Durham companies can access finance that doesn't encourage quick exits and therefore hopefully enables their growth to become large companies or PLCs. Â In addition to the provision of finance the fund manager will deliver a programme to help Durham companies become more aware of finance sources, help them access it and develop stronger strategy and governance. Â Finance Durham will become a new financial institution over the next few years as DCC intends to establish its own Finance Conduct Authority authorised and regulated fund management company that will take over the operation of Finance Durham. Â In time the fund management company will be able to raise additional funds from the private sector. Â Finance Durham has been modelled to invest in circa 60 companies in the typical range of Â£200,000 to Â£700,000, helping to create and safeguard around 2,000 jobs. Â Over a ten year modelled life and with conservative default rates (45%) this fund will generate Â£6million profit after all costs and the range of investments have returned.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Rental income, Forest Heath District Council - The council acquired the factory site in May 2012 securing 130 local jobs that had been at risk.  It then leased the site to a new business - Omar Group. This deal cost the council Â£1.456m, but secured Â£200k per annum in rent.  The company grew to employ 367 people but needed more factory space to increase production.  A new deal saw the Council invest more than Â£500,000 into the building of a factory extension - with the business paying the other 50 per cent of the construction costs.   This extension is expected to create a further 80 new jobs in our local economy.  In return Omar Group signed up to a new 15 year lease with an increase annual rent, representing a further 10% return on the new investment. The Council will also own the building at the end of the current lease.  The factory extension was opened in August this year.<br>

The council separated properties into an Investment Property Portfolio for properties which it would hold solely for investment reasons and agreed a set of guidelines for managing the portfolio, including the acquisition of new properties to add to the portfolio. A target has been set to increase gross income from commercial property by 50% by 2019/20 from a baseline of Â£3.2m in October 2015. To date the council has acquired two properties in Sutton that both provide an income of about Â£600,000, and has reviewed over 90 different property investment opportunities over the last 12 months.<br>

The model looks to grow the work by pulling it in from other organisations. The Council has also adopted a commercial approach to fees and charges, namely planning, parking, etc. over the past two years. Reigate &amp; Banstead is also driving assets harder, particularly property assets, to increase income over the longer term and assist in achieving financial sustainability. This has required a change in thinking and approach as an organisation over the past two years. Their aim is to assist the council in filling the budget gap and to become financially sustainable, i.e. government grant free, by 2020.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Building Control, South Norfolk District Council - South Norfolk was the second local authority to gain approval from the Construction Industry Council (CIC) to establish a wholly owned Approved Inspector (AI), ËœBuild Insight'- a company authorised to carry out commercial building control work outside our District. Local Authorities have increasingly been losing building control market share to AIs; in 2012, the AI market share was 40% and this has grown by 10% over the past three years.Â  Our Build Insight venture has married together the regulatory expertise of a local authority with the commercial mind-set of an AI by offering a wide-scale, end-to-end service that has a presence across the country to support large commercial or multi locational constructions that have previously been lost to the private sector. Our model looks to Ëœwin back' this work from the private sector to generate income to fund front-line services in South Norfolk.<br>

Previously, we had one person managing the payments and contract side of things, however we have put some extra resource into this, as well as changing our policy. This more commercially driven approach has allowed us to stop collections if someone has not paid, something that we had not done in the past. This also allowed us to get the income much quicker, and be able to turn our attention to attracting new customers to use the service. Since April 2016 to August 2016, we have increased the income for trade waste by around Â£15,000 and expect to see an outturn by the end of the financial year of at least Â£495,000.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Renting office space, Wyre Forest District Council - A review of WFDC's future space requirements demonstrated capacity to rent out office space in the council's new HQ building, Wyre Forest House. Following the review it took just under 12 months to generate income of Â£161,000 from tenants. We now have 7 Private Sector Tenants and 2 Public Sector tenants and generate income in excess of Â£250,000 per annum. The majority of our tenancy agreements are for 5 years so we are on target to achieve more than Â£1m of income over the next five years. There is no doubt the establishment of WFH and its commercial approach has had a hugely positive financial impact on Wyre Forest District Council and there are many more benefits for employees, businesses and residents. Feedback from private and public sector tenants demonstrates how this has helped them attract top candidates.<br>

We anticipate generating around Â£300,000 pa from this work.<br>

The potential income is as yet difficult to quantify.Â  However, financial modelling suggests that even a relatively conservative estimate of player participation could generate a reasonable income for the council once the lottery has become established.  Our estimate suggests after 5 years we would be looking to secure around Â£60,000 pa.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Highways Joint Venture, Nottinghamshire CC - the council has created a joint venture company with CORSERV, a company wholly-owned by Cornwall Council, to run most of its Highways and all of its Fleet Management services. The Â£44m company, called Via East Midlands Ltd, was launched in July 2016 under a ten-year service contract with an option to extend to 15 years. Cornwall Council's expertise was used to develop Via's business and financial plans.Â By operating in a more agile and flexible way and with access to a well-established and successful commercial bid team, the company increased the commerciality of the services because, although 100% public sector owned, Via is able to seek external work up to a value of almost 20% of its total turnover.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Property, Nottinghamshire CC - the council has developed a Joint Venture with Scape Group to provide Property Design and Operations services on the premise that a commercial partner will drive a more cost effective procurement supply chain as well as developing income opportunities from other areas including Academies and schools, other public sector bodies such as health, fire and police, other local authorities and the private sector. The Joint Venture is a ËœTeckal Company' which means it is controlled by the local authority and can trade by up to just under 20% of its turnover.  Scape hold the majority of shares (80:20) and the Board of the Joint Venture has representatives of both shareholders as both need to demonstrate control for the purposes of the 'Teckal' test. Efficiency savings generated by the joint venture (or surplus) from the work it does for NCC or Scape or returns generated from work undertaken for third parties, is shared 50:50.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Commercial Development Unit, Nottinghamshire CC - The developing commercial culture as a consequence of evaluating and adopting more risk based approaches to service delivery has prompted the County Council to consider how a number of different services can be supported in order to generate surplus income and move the Council to a position of increased self-sufficiency.  A small Commercial Development Unit (CDU) has been established on a pilot basis to promote, develop and challenge business proposals put forward by services, and to ensure a consistent approach is applied to capture, nurture and shape the most promising ideas. The CDU deliver commercial masterclasses (sales &amp; marketing, financial management, people &amp; change and systems &amp; processes) to service teams who then apply this learning to their own business ideas to help build an evidence pack. Three service areas were put through the three-month pilot which was delivered jointly with Essex CC. In-house expertise (finance, HR and marketing) was used to support the small unit and keep the additional costs to a minimum. The three service areas developed robust business plans that are projected to deliver additional income of Â£1.7m over the three years for an initial investment of Â£280k. An annual net saving of Â£3.5m is projected to accrue by year 4, resulting in each of the services operating in a position cost neutrality.<br>
