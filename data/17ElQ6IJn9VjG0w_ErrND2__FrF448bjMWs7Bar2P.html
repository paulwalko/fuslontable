He served about eight years and got out on parole in October 2014.

<b>NAME:</b> Anhurak Jason Dej-Oudom<br>
<b>GENDER:</b> Male<br>
<b>AGE:</b> 9<br>
<b>CITY OF RESIDENCE:</b> Las Vegas<br>
<b>DECEASED BIO:</b> Phoukeo Dej-Oudom, 35, and her three children were killed by her husband on June 29. Police have said Jason Dej-Oudom, 32, fatally shot his wife in front of a northwest valley drug store on June 29. When police tracked the man to a nearby apartment complex later that night, they found the man had killed himself along with their children — Dalavanh Ariel Dej-Oudom, 15; Xonajuk J.J. Dej-Oudom, 14; and Anhurak Jason Dej-Oudom, 9. Nevada court records show that Phoukeo Dej-Oudom had filed for divorce a few weeks before she was killed. She also filed for a protection order against her husband, but it was denied without a hearing.<br>
<b>JURISDICTION:</b> Las Vegas<br>
<b>SUSPECT INFO:</b> Jason Dej-Oudom, 32, killed himself.<br>
<b>SUSPECT BIO:</b> Phoukeo Dej-Oudom married Jason Dej-Oudom in Franklin County in 2000. Out-of-state police records indicate that Jason Dej-Oudom had a decadelong history of abusing his wife and children. On Dec. 29, 2005, police in Fairfield, Ohio, responded to an emergency call from Phoukeo Dej-Oudom. She told police her husband had been choking, beating and kicking Dalavanh Dej-Oudom, then 5 years old.

Las Vegas police responded to a domestic violence incident at the family’s Torrey Pines condominium in June, but the department has refused to share details of that incident citing an open investigation. Police dispatch logs show that officers responded to the complex seven other times in June, including a call about a family disturbance on June 21 — the night before a custody hearing was to be held as part of the divorce.<br>
