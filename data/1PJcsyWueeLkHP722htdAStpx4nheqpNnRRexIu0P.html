<b>State:</b> Alabama<br>
<b>2014 grade:</b> C<br>
<b>2012 grade:</b> C<br>
<b>To Sum it up:</b> Alabama lawmakers created an Office of Information Technology in 2013, giving the state a cabinet-level position dedicated to information technology for the first time in its history. The new office is responsible for statewide IT strategic planning, governance and resource utilization. Since its creation, the central technology office helped push a number of modernization projects, including a move to replace aging financial and HR applications with a new ERP system.<br>

<b>State:</b> Arizona<br>
<b>2014 grade:</b> B<br>
<b>2012 grade:</b> C<br>
<b>To Sum it up:</b> Arizona's grade made a significant leap in the 2014 survey, powered by steadily growing IT investment and a rapid embrace of cloud-based solutions. State CIO Aaron Sandeen worked with Gov. Jan Brewer's budget director to create a new fund specifically for large-scale IT projects. The fund has pumped nearly $100 million into IT modernization projects since it was launched in fiscal 2013. The Arizona Strategic Enterprise Technology office oversees the fund to ensure that projects conform to the state's enterprise architecture and other requirements. Arizona's modernization activities include a growing emphasis on both cloud and open source technologies. In addition, the state has boosted investment in training for IT staff.<br>

Over the past five years, those arrangements have let the state modernize and virtualize key technology systems. The services-based approach also led to the development of detailed reports on IT consumption and costs – giving agencies better transparency on how usage patterns affect the price of IT services.

In addition to conducting a massive IT transformation that converted the former Office for Technology — which had no authority over IT development — into a new Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) that manages all of the state’s IT functions, New York also is consolidating dozens of data centers into just one statewide data center. In addition, ITS is developing its Next-Generation GIS that will be a centralized, state-of-the-art suite of shared resources for use by all agencies and citizens. Also, Gov.

<b>To Sum it up:</b> Breaking down silos and working as part of a team was a requirement in North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory's directive — for IT organizations across the executive branch to create a culture of customer service. Doing business with the state, he said, should be "as easy as checking the scores or shopping on a smart phone.” And the collaboration was formalized in the state's "One IT" strategy — in which IT leaders from the cabinet-level agencies partner as a statewide enterprise versus operating as individual businesses. Since the 2012 Digital States Survey, the state launched its <a href="http://www.govtech.com/technology/North-Carolina-Unveils-New-Innovation-Center.html" target="_blank">Innovation Center</a> in October 2013 so it could test possible solutions prior to the procurement process, allowing for better definition of requirements and informing of purchasing decisions. Since the opening, employees and agency CIOs have tested approximately $4.5 million worth of technology at no cost to state government.<br>
