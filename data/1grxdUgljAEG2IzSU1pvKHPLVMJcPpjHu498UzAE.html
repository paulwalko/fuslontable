But when things start going and the economy starts to go away, you see that the sand and the cement almost completely disappear.   Like Searles Valley Minerals, Cemex is feeling the pinch of the Great Recession in that no one is building and therefore, no one needs building materials.  "We were going like gangbusters," said Cemex San Diego Terminal Manager John Gonzales, "and all of a sudden it was like someone shut off the water spigot."  Gonzales says that the company plans on riding out the recession. "We have no intentions on leaving."</td>

"We've been able to build up the business and we're doing more all the time, but it's a long battle," said Ed Plant, the president of the company.  "Maintenance costs us $200,000 a year, so it's a big cost, shall we say, to do business," he said.  Plant believes the Port took the company's high cost of maintenance into consideration when negotiating the lease terms.</td>

			<td colspan="2"><strong>Summary:</strong> Dole is considered an "anchor tenant" for the Port of San Diego, and with the recent signing of the 24 and a half year lease, the company plans on being a staple in San Diego for the foreseeable future. The lease signing has drawn the ire of developers in town who see it as a major roadblock to discussions of redeveloping the land for a more commercial purpose.  But port staff see the lease as a good deal that promises a guaranteed income from a mega-corporation for decades to come.  The company imports millions of bananas, along with other fresh fruit, from South and Central America each year, and distributes throughout the west coast and up into Canada.</td>

The company was "huge for a long time," according to Port of San Diego Marine Terminal Superintendent Mark Taylor, exporting hundreds of thousands of tons worth of product each year out of the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. But aside from two years, this fiscal year and FY 06/07 the company went the last eight years without exporting a single metric ton from Tenth Avenue. In an email, Taylor exlained: "The decline was due to shrinking worldwide markets and Searles Valley shifting most of their bulk operations to Long Beach because of rail transportation costs into San Diego." "The reason we are [at the TAMT] is that we have storage silos there, which are part of our strategic plan," said David Goins, the director of distribution services for Searles Valley.</td>
