<b>Proj_Description:</b> To manage invasive aquatic plants and maintain infrastructure, lake associations and towns may decide to draw lakes down during the fall and refill them in the spring. This practice can yield unnatural downstream flow patterns that disrupt the lifecycle of resident aquatic organisms and alter the overall condition of the ecosystem. DER is working with the Housatonic Valley Association, the Town of Pittsfield, and lake associations to assess adjustments to drawdown management that consider both downstream flow regimes and lake user needs. Pittsfield is piloting an alternative approach at Onota Lake/Pecks Brook, beginning in October 2013. <br>

<b>OBJECTID:</b> Silver Lake and Jones River Sustainable Flow<br>
<b>Completion_Date:</b> In Progress<br>
<b>POINT_X:</b> -70.78614643<br>
<b>POINT_Y:</b> 42.01140806<br>
<b>Proj_Description:</b> The Jones River is the largest river draining to Cape Cod Bay. The river historically supported prolific runs of diadromous fish, which spawned in Silver Lake, at the river’s headwaters. Today, Silver Lake is the City of Brockton’s main water supply reservoir. The Jones River is dammed several hundred feet downstream of where it originally flowed from Silver Lake; this created what is now known as Forge Pond. Brockton regularly diverts water from Monponsett Pond (in the Taunton River Watershed) and Furnace Pond (in the North River Watershed) to Silver Lake. Flow through Forge Pond and into the Jones varies depending on these diversions and on Brockton’s intake for water supply. This water management, along with cranberry bogs and other forces, impacts water quality and streamflow in the Jones River. DER’s River Instream Flow Stewards began monitoring streamflow in the watershed in 2003. In 2011, DER helped the Jones River Watershed Association and partners to remove the Wapping Road Dam, significantly improving the opportunities for fish passage in the Jones. Restoration of more natural streamflows in the Jones became a DER Priority Project in 2012.

<b>POINT_X:</b> -70.5649598<br>
<b>POINT_Y:</b> 41.90336539<br>
<b>Proj_Description:</b> Since 2010, DER has been working with the landowner and numerous partners to transition approximately 600-acres of retired cranberry bogs and uplands to restored wetlands and protected open space.  On the eastern side, wetland restoration activities across approximately 225-acres are complete. The ecological restoration was managed by the Division of Ecological Restoration, with significant financial support from USDA NRCS and USFWS, and technical assistance and collaboration from many organizations including NOAA, the Town of Plymouth, American Rivers, MET, and others. The private landowners were heavily involved in the restoration process, developed a parallel learning initiative (<a href="http://www.livingobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Living Observatory</a>), and built on on-site native greenhouse to grown plants installed for the project. The project involved 8 dam removals, 3.5 miles of channel reconstruction, 3,000 pieces of large wood, tens of thousands of cubic yards of earthwork, and many thousands of plants installed on site. The construction contractor was SumCo Eco-Contracting, and the project engineering Inter-Fluve,Inc. The land is now opened to the public as the new <a href="https://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/tidmarsh" target="_blank">Mass Audubon Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary</a>. Today, the western side of the former farm is owned by the Town of Plymouth and managed as public open space (the new Foothills Preserve). DER, NRCS, Ducks Unlimited, Mass Audubon, and Inter-Fluve are all working with the Town to design a wetland and stream restoration project. While still a few years from construction, the project should involve wetland restoration across approximately 50-acres, 7 dam removals, and over a mile of channel restoration. Research is on-going at both sites, and will help inform future restoration actions for years to come.   <br>

<b>Proj_Description:</b> This project is part of DER's Culvert Replacement Training Initiative. DER is working with the Town of Brookfield to replace the existing degraded infrastructure with a new culvert that meets the MA River and Stream Crossing Standards. The culvert on Rice Corner Crossing Road is a 110' long, undersized, degraded 60" corrugated metal pipe and is a barrier to fish and wildlife. The culvert is at about a 45 degree skew to the road, and has 3 obsolete run of the river dams downstream. A culvert replacement will have to factor in the future of the downstream infrastructure into the replacement design.  Replacing the culvert will improve stream continuity and improve local infrastructure.<br>

<b>POINT_Y:</b> 42.445002<br>
<b>Proj_Description:</b> The 23-acre Crescent Marsh site is located in East Saugus. Prior to construction of Route 107 and the incinerator access road, this area of marsh was contiguous with the larger Rumney Marshes Area of Critical Environmental concern. Once the surrounding roads were constructed, a tidal hydrologic connection between this marsh and Bear Creek to the east was maintained by a 48-inch culvert located beneath the incinerator access road.  A portion of the 48-inch culvert recently collapsed beneath the access road and now severely restricts tidal hydrology to the marsh.  Since the collapse, the marsh has rapidly converted from healthy salt marsh to a degraded brackish/fresh wetland dominated by invasive species including Phragmites and Pepperweed.  DER is exploring alternatives for restoring tidal flow to the marsh with the intent of restoring up to 23 acres of healthy salt marsh habitat.<br>

<b>Proj_Description:</b> This project is part of DER's Culvert Replacement Training Initiative. DER is working with the Town of Ashfield to replace the existing degraded infrastructure with a new culvert that meets the MA River and Stream Crossing Standards. The culvert on Baptist Corner Road is an undersized, degraded 60" corrugated metal pipe and is a barrier to fish and wildlife. Additionally, the stone headwall is degraded and falling down, causing a significant public safety concern.  There are reproducing native trout in the stream and replacing the culvert will improve stream continuity and improve local infrastructure. This site is unique because there is 15 feet of road fill over the culvert.<br>

This was the first salt marsh restored by the New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council as part of the Council’s efforts to restore natural resources injured through the release of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances into the New Bedford Harbor Environment.  This project replaced an undersized culvert with a larger, properly-sized culvert to connect the 6.5 acre Padanarum saltmarsh to Apponagansett Bay. Project results were almost immediate with increased tidal inundation and higher salinities facilitating the die-off of woody vegetation and invasive species that had encroached upon the marsh. In addition, fish that were unable to access the marsh surface prior to the restoration are now present in the thousands.<br>

<b>Proj_Description:</b> Town Creek is located between Route 1 and an abandoned rail bed crossing the marsh in Salisbury. Historically, the rail crossed Town Creek on a trestle that did not obstruct tidal flow.  Development in low portions of the upstream floodplain necessitated flood control by elimination of the trestle and installation of a culvert and tide gates.  Resulting reduced tidal influence lead to expansion of Phragmites and degradation of water quality.  In 2014, the installation of two new culverts with properly-functioning tide gates restored more natural tidal exchange while protecting low-lying properties.<br>

However, two stone dikes were constructed in the early 1600s to isolate the marsh from the tides for salt marsh haying. The project restored the tide’s natural ebb and flow by replacing two culverts with 20-foot wide open-channels.<br>

<b>Proj_Description:</b> The restoration project removed the Bartlett Rod Shop Company Dam (Pelham) in 2012 to facilitate upstream fish passage, restore natural riverine processes, and address risks posed by failing infrastructure. Soon after the removal, Sea lamprey were found just below and upstream of the former dam for the first time in decades. However, storm events and natural fluvial geomorphic processes then resulted in the exposure of a formerly buried Timber Dam in the streambed just upstream. Dating from perhaps 1750(!), this new dam blocked most fish passage and was removed in early 2016. <br>
