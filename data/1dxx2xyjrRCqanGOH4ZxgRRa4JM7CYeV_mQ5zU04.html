<p><strong><span class="font-size-2">Date: January 5-8, 2012</span></strong></p>
<p>The CLE in San Marcos brought together twelve teams from eight states to work on their local issues in education and community development. As community teams walked the Texas State University campus and saw the statue of a young Lyndon Johnson, they shared their stories and the experiences of their communities.  Just as Johnson used his stories to shape future actions, these teams imagined what they could do in their communities.  To reinforce the idea that public institutions are for the people of a community, we held action-planning sessions in meeting rooms at the State Capitol in nearby Austin.  At each step of the learning exchange process, the context supported the work of these teams.</p>

<p>This Exchange illuminated how the Laguna and Acoma pueblos have used storytelling to claim and maintain core identity through centuries of outside influence. The power of language, history and the culture of place were presented as a source of collective identity and grounding for moving forward in the 21st century – particularly through education in the schools. CLE participants experienced the spirit of Acoma culture while visiting ancient Sky City and the deep hospitality and generosity of the Laguna Pueblo during the feast day of St. Joseph. A strong theme was the importance of working across the generations to engage youth, adults and elders in partnership.</p>

Provided methods that community leaders can use to track their own growth as well as strategies for developing the skills of others. The Buffalo hosts were particularly skilled in translating abstract social equity intentions into concrete and actionable strategies for change. Buffalo provided a powerful setting for this exploration with the Erie Canal, Underground railroad, and Colored Musicians Club.

The focus was on reclaiming cultural wisdom as a source of community wellbeing.  The goal was to re-imagine how systems can align more meaningfully across similar and dissimilar organizations in and across local communities, and across both geographical and philosophical boundaries. Embedded in native Hawaiian culture for the learning exchange, we used a “go to the source” model to help participants honor their our own cultures, histories, spirits, and connection to place in order to build strong relationships capable of sustaining their communities. Throughout the Learning Exchange community teams looked to the roots of culture and language to explore how to create more innovative systems to support and engage families and children. This focus provided a solid foundation upon which to support stronger infrastructure capable of building stronger and healthier families.

An exciting mix of communities participated: the Salish/Kootenai, Lummi, Seneca, White Clay, Acoma, and Laguna tribal nations; the National Rites of Passage; Llano Grande Center; and groups from across the Hawaiian islands – Ka Honua Momona, Aha Punana Leo, Kauhale o Waini’anae, INPEACE, and Kamehameha Schools.
