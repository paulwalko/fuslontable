<b>Approach to the Site:</b> It is small town near the coast situated about 5 km south of Putuccēri (Pondicherry). To reach this place one has to go 4 km from Pondicherry - Cuddalore road and take a diversion near Ariyān̤kuppam and proceeds further eastward along the metalled road.<br>
<b>Nature of the Findings:</b> Stone image of Buddha<br>
<b>Condition of the Findings:</b> The nose and a portion of the face are disfigured.<br>
<b>Size of the Findings:</b> H x B x W: 1.46 m x 90 cm x 42 cm<br>
<b>Brief Description:</b> Buddha is shown seated straight in the vajrāparyaṅkāsana (sitting posture in which both the legs are firmly crossed so that the feet with soles visible rest on the thighs) attitude on the pericarp of a full blossomed lotus. He is in the dhyāna-pose with his right palm placed on the left palm in his lap. Buddha is draped in a long lower garment and an upper garment which leaves his right arm, chest and shoulder bare. The pleated end of the upper garment is seen on the left shoulder of Buddha.  There is an ushnͅīśa, the cranial protuberance symbolizing Buddha hood, in the form of flame. An ornate arch or tōrana is shown over his head.<br>
<b>Chronology:</b> 10th -11th centuries CE<br>
<b>DateCertainty:</b> century range approximation<br>
<b>Ownership:</b> Private<br>
<b>Associated Findings:</b> Arikamētͅu, the famous trading station on the east coast of India, yielded many Chinese potteries in addition to the pottery and other materials brought from Italy and other Western countries.<br>
<b>Local Tradition:</b> It is interesting to note that many Buddha images are found in and around Pondicherry in the villages very close to the coast. This shows that Pondicherry and its surrounding area were flourished as an important centre of Buddhism at least in the period between the 10th to 13th centuries CE.  
Another noteworthy feature is that almost all the above places yielded Chinese and South-East Asian potteries datable to 10th-14th centuries CE.  Arikamētͅu, the famous trading station on the east coast of India, yielded many Chinese potteries in addition to the pottery and other materials brought from Italy and other Western countries. The Chinese celadon wares found at Arikamētͅu have all the characteristic of the Sung and Yuan Lung Chuan wares and may perhaps be ascribed to circa 10th-12th centuries CE. The Yuan Shi (Yuan-Shi-zin-bian), the annals of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368 CE) compiled in the 14th century mentions the name of Xin-cun as the port on the Coromandel coast, where Chinese envoys arrived in 1281. The Chinese text mentions that the Chinese Emperor, being anxious to receive a mission from the king of Ju-lan as a token of his submission, sent Imperial envoys to Ju-lan for that purpose in 1280.  The port city Xin-cun mentioned in this work is identified variously with Kāveripūmpatͅtͅinͅam,  Sadras (Caturaṅgapatͅtͅinͅam) and Sōpuram (Tiruccōpuram) or Cintāmanͅi on the Coromandal coast. N. Karashima identified this place with  Pondicherry on the ground that Xin-cun means a "new village" in the Chinese language. Putucc_ri, the original form of Pondicherry also means a "new village" in the Tamil language. As stated above that the discovery of many Chinese and South-East Asian potteries of the 12th-15th centuries in the  Pondicherry area testified the fact that this area flourished as an important sea-port and trade centres during that period.<br>

<b>DateCertainty:</b> century range approximation - modification date not mapped<br>
<b>Ownership:</b> Mārimuttu matͅam<br>
<b>Associated Findings:</b> It was originally found in a mound locally known as Buddhamētͅu situated about a kilometre south-west of the Āttūr village. The mound is originally about 1.8 m high and spread out more than 11/2 acres of land. The mound is totally levelled and the whole area is brought under cultivation at present.  There is no trace of any ancient structure in this area. Except few pottery of Medieval period, there are hardly any other archaeological evidences in this locality.<br>
<b>Local Tradition:</b> It is told that the sculpture was lying on the mound upside down for quite a long time. Few years before some people try to smuggle the sculpture after making some modification in the face, etc. The local people stopped the smuggling of the sculpture and installed it in the present locality.<br>

<b>Brief Description:</b> There are seven Buddha images on the southern compound wall (prākāra) towards the right of the side entrance of the temple. All the seven bas-relief figures are the seated Buddha in ardha-padmāsana over a moulded pedestal. Both of his hands are kept on the lap in dhyāna pose. They have elongated ear-lobes and broad shoulder. There is an ushnͅīśa-like projection over their head.  
The garment has shown covered the left shoulder leaving the right bare. All are carved within a niche fashioned in arch shape. In some cases (i.e. three) the sunken niches are shown within the embossed tōranͅa. 
 In addition to these seven bas-relief sculptures of   seated Buddha, there is also a bas-relief of Buddha in parinirvāna (reclining form) found on the eastern outer compound wall (prākāra) of the temple. The image is about 61 cm. The face is slightly damaged. There is a prabhā over the head. He is wearing a close fitting long robe extending from neck to ankles. He has a prominent ūrnͅā and flame-like ushnͅīśa projection over their head. This stone is also used for the construction of the compound wall. (C. Minakshi, 1979, p. 109; Mayilai. Cini. Venkatacami, 1980, p. 54 and plate)   
 On the inner side of the northern wall of the outer prākāra of the temple, enclosing the flower garden is a Buddha small in size worked into a niche with a tōranͅa and two pilasters decorating the outline of the niche. The above figure is sculptured on the face of a rectangular block of stone which is now built into the wall. (C. Minakshi, 1979, p. 110)
In this same temple Prof. Dubreuil has noticed a slab with the carving of “Temptation of Buddha” in 1927. He sent this figure to the Musee Guimmet in Paris. (C. Minakshi, 1979, p. 110)

Stylistically the Buddha figure is datable to the 5th century CE or little later.
The buddhapāda of 3rd-4th centuries CE was found little away from the vihāra to its south. The buddhapāda was of palnad lime stone and showed a small receptacle cut between the long toes of the feet and intended for the relic offerings. The buddhapāda of similar nature noticed at Nāgarjunakonͅdͅa is dateable to c. 3rd century CE by its inscription. The buddhapāda pair is showing the auspicious symbols such as the pūrnͅa-kalasa, svastika and śrivatsa, etc. The four important events of the Buddha's life ending with chaitya worship representing mahāparinirvāna are also depicted on the slab.  
The chaitya or temple was excavated on the southern side of the vihāra. The foundation and ground floor pattern of the structure is preserved at present. The temple, square on plan, built in pañca-ratha (five offsets) style stands on a lofty plinth of brick, moulded in jagatī, padma, etc. The rectangular or ‘L’ shaped as well as the small square voids in the foundation, together with the large central squarish void, would seem to suggest that the structures stood in more than one storey height and perhaps the shrine was erected by a astylar corbelling principle with staircases leading to the upper floor from all the three sides except the east, towards which it was obviously facing. The sanctum was perhaps on the top of the central large square void, after spanned the void by corbelling method from four sides and provided with floor of the sanctum on its top. Except the traces of granite members, perhaps used as pillars the entire structure was of brick and stucco. The walls were originally decorated with the moulded bricks and stucco ornamentation. Traces of a few layers of paintings have also been noticed on the stucco pieces recovered in the excavations. There is no clear evidence about the height and number of storeys of the structure. But it could not be less than two or three storeys, as it was not uncommon in Brāhmanͅical temples of that age. The temple might have been surmounted by a vimāna either in the form of kūtͅakāra or curvilinear. 
Mēlaiyūr, located very close to the site where the Buddhist remains excavated, had yielded beautiful bronzes including a gilted Maitreya as a treasure trove in 1927.<br>
<b>Chronology:</b> The available evidence suggests that the monastery belonged to 4th-5th centuries CE and the temple or chaitya of 6th -7th centuries CE. These structures went into disuse perhaps due to the effects of intrusion of the sea.<br>
<b>DateCertainty:</b> century range approximation - two separate structures<br>
<b>Ownership:</b> Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai circle<br>
<b>Associated Findings:</b> Large number of pottery, amphorae, glass objects, coins from Italy and other western countries and potteries and coins from China and South-East Asian countries are found in and around Kāverippūmpatͅtͅinͅam.<br>
<b>Local Tradition:</b> Buddadatta, the great Pāli scholar, was said to have written the work called Abhidhammāvatāra, while he was residing in a monastery at Kāveripatͅtͅanͅa.  According to the version of the author the monastery in which the above mentioned work completed was built by one Kanhadāsa.   The literary sources mention many Buddhist establishments at  Kāverippūmpatͅtͅinͅam such as:  Seven Intira vikāram,   Kuccarakutͅikai, Cakkaravālͅakkōtͅtͅam, a small pavilion made of crystal in a park called Upavan̤a with a replica of the Buddha's foot print for worship; the prison converted into a Buddhist monastery by the   Cōl̤a king Kilͅlͅivalͅavan̤ at the request of the nun Manͅimēkalai, etc. <br>

The auspicious symbols such as pūrnͅa-kumbha beneath the umbrella and pair of fly whisks, dharma-chakra, sword, bow, etc and merchant guild symbols such as pacumpai (merchant bag in the form of kettle-drum) and plough are carved on the stone slab. On the top level of the slab there is an inscription in Tamil which reads, “Svastisri Vīratāvalͅattil bauttappalͅlͅikku inta centāmarai kanͅnͅanallūr ullatͅaṅka irayiliyān̤a palͅlͅiccantam." (Centāmarai kanͅnͅanallūr was given as  palͅlͅiccandam to the Bauddapalͅlͅi at Vīratāvalͅam). This clearly indicates that the Buddhist establishment was patronized by the merchant community.
