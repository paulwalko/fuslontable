<p>South Africa - The Israeli Embassy has worked with Ikamba
Labantu, a local NGO, to introduce TIPA, Techno-Agriculture Innovation for
Poverty Alleviation, in the Eastern
  Cape, one of the country’s poorest provinces. This
system enables farmers, who were otherwise at the mercy of the region’s erratic
rainfall, to plant crops four times a year, leading to a 400% increase in
output.</p>

<p>Pakistan - Israeli designed GrainPro Cocoons provide a surprisingly simple and cheap way for African and Asian farmers to keep their grain market-fresh. The huge bags, invented by international food technology consultant Prof. Shlomo Navarro, keep both water and air out. They’re used all over the developed world, including Africa and the Far East, and even in countries that have no diplomatic ties to Israel, such as Pakistan.</p>

<p>China - Israel’s Seambiotic clean-tech company recently launched a commercial algae farm in China and does business in the United States and Italy as well. People don’t eat algae, but algae ponds nourished by power-plant effluent conserve farmed produce for human consumption because they generate 30 times more feedstock for biofuel than do land-based crop alternatives. Plus, the tiny plants, which thrive on carbon dioxide and sunlight, produce a valuable nutraceutical food additive that is especially popular in the Far East.</p>

<p>Uganda - Half a century ago, Lake Victoria carp was a significant part of the diet of the nearby Ugandan villagers. But when Nile perch was introduced to the lake, it decimated most of the smaller fish including the carp. Villagers had neither the equipment nor the expertise necessary to start fishing the huge perch, and symptoms of protein deficiency started becoming apparent in their children. Prof. Berta Sivan of Hebrew University came to the rescue with a multiyear project near to help these African families. Her team was able to apply techniques developed over many years for Israeli fish farmers. The Israeli project not only successfully spawned carp on Ugandan fish farms, but also provided training on how to dig and fill ponds and raise the small fish. Now local children have an abundant supply of protein to eat with their fruit and vegetables.</p>

Since tilapia tend to eat weeds, algae, and other underwater plants, growing them can also help keep rivers, lakes and even municipal water supplies clean.</p>
