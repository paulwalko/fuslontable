<b>Project Name:</b> Geomatics Graduate Tracking Tool<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> In the past the cartography program at SSFC surveyed its graduates six months after graduation. The data from these surveys helped the program build a &quot;Cart Contacts&quot; list of employers across the country. This list was very useful for new graduates looking for employment. More recently the provincial government has begun surveying graduates and has based college funding on the results of these surveys (Key Performance Indicators or KPI ). At Fleming we have a department which collects data for use within the college (Fleming Data Research or FDR). The collection of data has always been a part of the Geomatics world and this project would be a natural &quot;next step&quot; by enabling information about Geomatics graduates to be presented in a spatial context. Potential uses of this project include management student job placement and marketing of the Geomatics program: Marketing – the ability to track graduates of the Geomatics Program at Fleming and show where they are located in Canada and around the world gives us the ability to promote our Fleming Geomatics programs with a clearer picture of Fleming’s role in the Geomatics industry Keep detailed employment info for future job placement Determine potential sources for new GIS students (specific Universities) Observe hiring trends in the Geomatics industry Observe Fleming Grad placement trends over 30 yrs of Cartography and GIS Use actual Geomatics technology to showcase our programs<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Historical Driving Tours in Waterloo Region - Interactive Website<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Students will create an interactive mapping website providing historical routes within the Townships (Wilmot Wellesley North Dumfries and Woolwich) of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This website will be utilizing ESRIs ArcIMS to provide the on-line interactivity.Users will be able to view the four historical routes created by the students based solely on the routes originally published by the Regions Planning Department.Users will be able to click on any historical point of interest and view information pertaining to that point as well as have access to up to ├óÔé¼╦£X number of pictures of the particular point of interest. This functionality will mirror the ├óÔé¼╦£out of the box identify function within an ArcIMS site with the exception of retrieving image and information blurbs in lieu of basic attribute reports.Additionally the Region would like the website to have a buffer functionality that would allow users to view and access information of historical sites within a specified radius. Due to the nature of the projected users of this website we would like to be able to provide the user a drop down list of hotels/motels in the area. This layer would be used to buffer against returning all historical points of interest within a specified radius. Also the user would have to option to type their address into the search in order to create a radius around the geocoded address.Lastly the students will program four predefined extents so that a user will be able to view the full extent of each of the four historical routes. This could be completed with the user of a dropdown box with each of the four routes written in the drop-down.<br>

New GIS Dataset: Historical Routes based on the Historical Routes pamphlet obtained from the Planning Department at the Region of Waterloo.Cartographic Output: Four cartographically sound maps outlining each of the four historical routes within Region of Waterloo. These maps will be available in hardcopy in a size determined by the student group or supervisor utilizing any cartographic software (ie. MicroStation). Additionally these four maps will also be available for download as part of the ArcIMS website. These maps will be in .pdf format available only in 81/2 x 11. These digital .pdf maps will mirror the colour scheme outlined in the first deliverable.Metadata: Metadata for all new GIS datasets following FGDC or CGDI standardsIntroduction Page: The Region would like a small Flash presentation before users enter the Historical Routes Interactive Website. This Flash should not run longer than 30 seconds and should outline the Historical Routes project. Flash supports sound bytes and may be the best way to present the website to potential users. The Region will let the students decide on the look of the page however we would like the same colour scheme as outlined in the first deliverable.Documentation: Students should know that the Region is considering adding this interactive mapping site to its own regional website. Because of this we would like to students to produce a write up outlining each of their responsibilities and their own background mirroring a resume. This document in concert with the website would do a great deal in promoting both the students own skills but also promote the GIS skills taught and learned as part of the GIS post-graduate programs at Fleming.Documentation: Secondarily it is important for any interactive website to have a robust and all-inclusive ├óÔé¼╦£Help Document. All functionality should be thoroughly explained so that any casual internet user could easily navigate the site.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Intensification in the Greater Toronto Area<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The phenomenon of urban sprawl is not new or novel. There are a number of ways of addressing this problem one of which is through a policy of urban intensification. Recently the Ontario government launched a provincial planning initiative with it's Places to Grow plan which attempts to address urban sprawl in and around the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The plan's promotes urban intensification stipulating that municipalities are required to direct 40% of new growth within the existing built up areas. How can municipalities identify which areas are appropriate for intensification? Which areas offer the most promise? Which areas sensitive and should be avoided? The goal of this project is to design a framework/model for identifying appropriate areas for urban intensification. The project will use a case study approach zeroing in on one municipality in the GTA (to be determined)<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> A spatial tool for planning and predicting successful gravel pit rehabilitation<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> This project involves the development of a spatial tool that can be used by planners ecologists and aggregate operators to guide and predict the spatial patterns of plant communities which will establish on aggregate sites once extraction has finished. For this project successful rehabilitation of these highly disturbed sites is considered to be the establishment of functioning native ecosystems.A key input will be species abundance/time curves which have been developed by the client using a chronosequence (sites of various ages) of gravel pits across southern Ontario. Other key features influencing successional processes include pit topography water table position deliberate rehabilitation efforts and linkages to natural features in the surrounding landscape. These will also be incorporated into the model. Only certain species and ecosites are possible in certain topographic settings.Aggregate sites are often clustered in the landscape due to the non-random spatial distribution of prime sand and gravel deposits. Opportunities for the successful establishment of native ecosystems in such areas may be enhanced by linking these sites together to avoid the bathtub landscape syndrome and to co-ordinate individual site rehabilitation efforts within a broader landscape scale plan. Another aspect of this project therefore will be to determine the best ways to link adjacent extraction sites without causing significant disturbances to other landscape features.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Data will be provided for a pilot landscape area within the eastern portion of the Oak Ridges Moraine where there are significant clusters of active gravel pits.For this pilot area the tool should be able to indicate the best routes to spatially link clusters of gravel pits given certain restrictions which can be input by the user. These could include the least number of roads lowered no houses removed no mature woodlots removed no streams crossed the least volume of material to be excavated etc. It is important that the user be able to change these restrictions easily and then observe the resulting extraction pattern.The tool should be able to plot expected vegetation cover patterns of the pit complexes (both by individual species and ecosite type) for a given amount of time in years since the end of extraction. The number of years should be easy to specify by the user. However there will have to be an upper limit as the chronosequence of sites surveyed upon which the species abundance curves are based do not extend beyond 80 years.Eventually the tool should also allow the user to modify certain starting conditions within each pit especially topography and rehabilitation technique used. These parameters would determine the categories of ecosites possible and slow or speed the species abundance/time curves in a clearly defined mathematical way. This step may be completed in a future coop project<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Watershed Tools<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Comparative Aquatic Effects Program (CAEP) is a long-term ecological study of the effects of timber harvesting activities on coldwater stream fish habitat. CAEP is investigating how the interaction between terrestrial and stream systems is influenced by the spatial scale under consideration (i.e. watershed size). The comparative approach taken for this project exploits variability (natural and man made) that exists among streams. The following is a general outline of the approach:Sampling sites are selected using a GIS database based on catchment area (1 10 and 100 square km in a nested design) and landscape disturbance history (extent and timing of harvest or forest fire)Stream sites are surveyed using a repeatable spatially independent sampling protocol developed by the MNRs Great Lakes Salmonid Unit. The survey provides information on biotic (fish and invertebrates) and physical (including hydrologic characteristics substrate composition and cover) characteristics of the stream. Fish are sampled using a backpack electrofishing unit weighed measured and releasedResearch Program Goals:To determine the extent of catchment deforestation required to impact stream habitat (where impact means a change in the state of a habitat variable correlated with stream fish productivity beyond the range of natural variability)Provide an indication of how spatial scale is related to harvest impact (e.g. how might harvesting 50 per cent of a 1 square kilometre catchment differ from harvesting 50 per cent of a 10 or 100 square kilometre catchment?)Results could lead to changes in timber harvest guidelines with steps taken to minimize impacts on aquatic systems at the appropriate spatial scale throughout the timber management planning processGoals of the GIS Project Delineation of watersheds from DEM data and quantification of watershed characteristics using DEM and other GIS data (points lines polys grids)Delineation of surficial runoff pathways from DEMs<br>

The application and database need to be accessible to users in a variety of locations within the college making a secure dynamic web application the best solution. Specifically the program requires: An enterprise database to log collection data on an ongoing basis starting with current data collected but also with the addition of new data and future options. The ability for students and faculty to enter data and query through the web. Password use for data entry and queries and separate password to change data. The database should be able to print information in a form format also be able to print spreadsheet format for a summary of data. The ability to perform queries is necessary. The ability for the data to be mapped and linked to a query.

<b>Project Name:</b> Land Acquisition Decision Support Tools<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The County of Simcoe requires a spatial analysis tool to analyze candidate sites for land acquisition for a number of business units. The land acquisitions decisions support tool would provide business specific analysis for the acquisition of whole or partial parcels for:1. Forestry Lands consolidation2. Roads Reconstruction and Widening3. General Infrastructure Development suitabilityEach area has specific requirements around the analysis of parcel data to determine suitability. The analysis criteria must be further developed with each business unit within the County. Priority for tool development is as listed above.Forestry Lands Consolidation: This tool will provide the user with the ability spatially analyze the current Forestry Lands and will generate a listing of suitable parcels from the Countys assessment parcel mapping. Criteria for ranking suitability of lands to acquire will include adjacency/proximity to existing Forest Tracts Size of parcel and percentage in vegetated cover assessed status (i.e. vacant farm residence) presence of natural heritage features (provincially significant features) etc.Roads Reconstruction and Widening: This tool will provide the user with the ability to select specific County Road Segments for road widening/reconstruction. The user will then specify an offset for the widening. The offset will select any land parcels affected by the widening split and retain the portions of the parcel within the offset and generate a report describing each parcel its address the area in square metres that will need to be expropriated for the widening and a map of the specific parcel location.General Infrastructure Suitability: This tool will provide the user with the ability to specify several criteria to narrow a search for vacant lands for the purpose of developing a new County facility. The user will be able to graphically select a subject area or municipality and specify the size of parcel required. Analysis will query all parcels coded as vacant and will also consider existing County owned lands regardless of vacancy status. Additional criteria could include adjacency to County Roads or Highways and proximity to centres of population.The County of Simcoe is presenting these as distinct tools in order to provide options for achievable goals. Each item can be treated as a distinct phase and considering the students workload and changes to the scope of each item the project can be limited to one or multiple tools.;Fully commented code and documentation to implement the developed tools using the specified software environment available at the County of Simcoe.

<b>Project Name:</b> Lake Simcoe Shoreline Inventory and Interactive Mapping Web-tool<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Policy 6.12-SA of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan calls for the development of Shoreline Management Strategy (SMS) by June 2012. This SMS will provide an inventory of the shoreline and navigable portions of the large rivers flowing into Lake Simcoe that will include information of shoreline condition riparian condition and anthropogenic alterations as well as survey structures around the lake. This inventory is meant to provide important information for fish and wildlife habitat assessments such as identification of significant fish and wildlife areas and habitats such as wetlands woodlands spawning habitat and biological productive areas. This inventory would also be used in determining priority areas of restoration along the shoreline. The goals of this project are to have a complete and updated record of the shoreline using current ortho-photography as well as recently acquired oblique imagery. Policy 6.47 of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan calls for the delineation of priority areas for restoration and other areas to focus natural heritage protection improvement restoration securement and enhancement efforts. The Ministry of Natural Resources has identified these priority areas but we now need to make the mapping available to community stewardship groups in the Lake Simcoe Watershed. Part of the mapping to be made available will be the record of the shoreline mentioned in 1).The goals of this project are to develop an interactive web-tool which will allow community stewardship groups to view the mapping display various layers and zoom in on areas where they may undertake a specific project.

<b>Project Name:</b> Spatial modeling of lake sturgeon habitat in the Mattagami River near Timmins Ontario<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The objective of the project is to identify and describe habitat features of lake sturgeon based on spatial modelling. Telemetrymonitored lake sturgeons are demonstrating a high propensity for certain sites in the Mattagami River. What are the unique features of these sites that may be compelling the fish to remain there? Our goal is to describe the physical attributes of these sites using spatial models created from elevation/depth data. We see an opportunity for the Fleming Coop program to assist the project by creating the spatial models. This project is part of a broader effort to rehabilitate lake sturgeon in the section of river near Timmins. Several local partners including MNR are involved in monitoring the movements of transplanted fish. Northeast Science &amp; Information is complementing the project through these habitat studies.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database design/Processing- spatial/Statistical analysis- programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The Coop students will be required to:Import provided bathymetry data into a GIS environment. This data is in a text file format which requires the use of Microsoft Access for example as an intermediate step in order for ArcGIS to accept the correct table format. Once the shapefile is created further data prepping is required such as calculating the depth values into a new field as minus values (when creating bathymetric models we need to show depth versus elevation with positive values). Other examples of data prepping is selecting and exporting the unique values in the created shapefile database field named [Channel] (Downscan SideScan and Primary) as the depth TIN/Raster/Hillshade/IDW (student will determine the best bathymetric representation) is derived from the downscan values only. The student will also need to resolve projection issues with the proprietary data (Lowrance projection is unique). We see this as a first-step problem solving requirement prior to model buildingGenerate TINs (3-D models such as Raster/Hillshade/IDW) of three small sections (300m 2km) of the Mattagami River from bathymetry data Build terrain model (above water) using data from project partners. This may require digitizing contour lines from floodplain maps (MNR is currently investigating data availability). Spatially and visually link terrain and river channel models.

<b>Project Name:</b> Ontario Agricultural Resource Inventory (AgRI): A New Approach to Field Observation Database Attribution using ArcPad<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Background:The new Ontario Agricultural Resource Inventory (AgRI) has been developed incrementally by OMAFRA as a high-resolution digital polygon framework for Ontarios farm landscape with multi-temporal databases of cropping and tillage system attributes for cropped fields. Farm field observations are the key ground truth data acquisitions for accretion of these databases for each cropping season. Paper maps with orthophoto backgrounds printed at 1:10000 on 11 X 17 paper have been the standard field mapping data collection method. Their tedious preparation printing and observation extraction-data entry consume considerable geomatics time and resources on both ends of the field mapping missions. ArcPad offers a geomatics alternative to the current paper map AgRI database development method.The Challenge:OMAFRA would like to move from sole reliance on the current paper-based AgRI field data collection-to-database method of populating its AgRI GIS database to a more direct GPS-technology based attribution method using ArcPad. This will eliminate two tedious and time-consuming process steps in the current method - the production of the field paper map sets and subsequent extraction of the field information from them. The desire is for this new ArcPad-based method to be mounted on field-portable laptops or tablets equipped with accurate GPS technology.;<ol>Using the Ontario AgRI digital polygon framework and the associated digital orthophotography as well as the current AAFC ArcPad method as model elements develop test and validate an ArcPad application to collect and attribute the cropping and tillage system databases for agricultural field polygons of the Ontario AgRI.Develop a brief and very straightforward instruction/training manual for this new Ontario AgRI ArcPad application that provides the following:How to activate the application view the background AgRI polygon framework and orthos make field observation data entries save these data entries and safely turn off the application.How to access the ArcPad field observation data successfully attribute it the Ontario AgRI polygons and view both the AgRI database and the crop or tillage system maps on the GIS.How to change/update the background AgRI polygon framework and the orthos for future mapping missions (in different locations different years etc.Note: This instruction/training manual should be aimed at both professional and student users of this ArcPad application who have expertise in cropping and tillage system identification but whose geomatics experience/expertise is limited.Assess computer hardware options for Ontario AgRI field observations with this new ArcPad approach. This may include testing it on different platforms (as available) or simply providing results of some time-limited research into potential platforms (and their pros and cons).<br>

Other AgRI polygons developed for the rural landscape include farmsteads fencerows rural residential rural business recreational and institutional features. Ontarios greenhouse industry footprint has substantial acreage under glass. These greenhouses are readily distinguishable in high-resolution digital orthophotography. These horticultural enterprises have yet to be captured explicitly as distinct polygons in the new Ontario AgRI across the province.The Challenge:OMAFRA needs a means to systematically identify delineate and digitize polygons for all of the greenhouse acreage across the province in order to build a component layer for the new Ontario AgRI. At this point manual digitizing remains a reliable but time intensive process to accomplish this task. Moving forward to implement an automated or semi-automated method will eliminate much of the tedious and time-consuming process steps in the current method. The desire is for a new method to become part of the arsenal of tools used to build the detailed Ontario AgRI provincewide.;The current Ontario AgRI digital polygon framework is a guide to the level of detail being built into this agricultural landscape information resource. Using the associated digital orthophotography as the base for identification delineation and digitizing select some sentinel regions where greenhouses are clustered (ex. Leamington) to develop test and validate an automated or semi-automated method (ex. Definiens eCognition etc ) to create an example portion of what will become eventually an Ontario Under Glass digital polygon layer.OMAFRA has developed a means to assign unique identification labels to each farm field in the Ontario AgRI data layer. Adapt this method to enable each greenhouse polygon to have its own unique ID.Develop a brief and very straightforward instruction/training manual for this new Ontario AgRI greenhouse digitizing application that provides the following:How to set up the required background orthoimagery for digitizing.How to operate the automated/semi-automated method to create new greenhouse polygons.How to save these new polygons and safely turn off the application.How to access these greenhouse polygons and view them with the existing Ontario AgRI database to display with the crop or tillage system maps on the GIS.How to change/update the background orthoimagery for future mapping work (in different locations for different years to track changes etc.)Note: This instruction/training manual should be aimed at both professional and student users of this digitizing application whose geomatics experience/expertise varies widely.Assess computer hardware options for using this new digitizing application to build the Ontario AgRI digital polygon framework. This may include testing it on different platforms (as available) or simply providing results of some time-limited research into potential platforms (and their pros and cons).;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Programming/CustomizationA fourth requirement will have to be added to this project by the students<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Urban Forest Canopy and Land Use for the Region of Peel<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Peel Urban Forest Strategy (Strategy) was completed in 2011 through a partnership of The Regional Municipality of Peel (the ÔÇ£Region of PeelÔÇØ), the Cities of Brampton and Mississauga, the Town of Caledon, Credit Valley Conservation, and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. In developing the Strategy, a canopy cover assessment was undertaken in the urban areas of Peel Region (cities of Mississauga, Brampton, and the communities of Bolton and Caledon East in the Town of Caledon) based on 2007 Quick Bird satellite imagery.
One of the action items in the Strategy is regular monitoring of the canopy cover in order to refine targets, develop and evaluate urban forest programs, and prioritize management actions. The current information is now eight (8) years old and many areas in Brampton and Caledon have seen the development of greenfield areas. There have also, in the intervening years, been on-going naturalization and planting projects and areas of the communities where trees are now of a sufficient size to have identifiable canopies. At the same time there have been a number of pests and environmental conditions (eg. excessive heat, freezing rain) that have seen the demise of trees.

For these reasons, an update to the canopy cover data is being proposed for 2015 based on summer leaf on conditions. A large part of Peel Region is rural with a pattern of hamlets, villages, agricultural and rural lands. This canopy cover assessment will also include these areas as well. An analysis of this information would update the canopy cover data based on current land cover conditions (eg, tree canopy, shrub, field/grass, paved surfaces).

Background
The Region of Peel was incorporated in 1974 on the principle that certain community and infrastructure services are most cost-effective when administered over a larger geographic area. The Region includes urban and rural areas serving more than 1.35 million residents in the cities of Mississauga and Brampton and the Town of Caledon. The urban areas for the purposes of the urban forest constitute the cities of Mississauga and Brampton, and the communities of Bolton and Caledon East in the Town of Caledon for an approximate area of 580 square km. The total area of Peel Region is 1,258 square km.

The current canopy cover data indicates an overall canopy cover of 11% in Brampton, 17% in Bolton, and 29% in Caledon East in 2007. Mississauga undertook an update to the canopy cover in 2014 with a change from 15% to 19%. The canopy cover assessment identifies existing canopy cover, potential pervious canopy cover, potential impervious canopy cover, and areas not suitable for canopy cover.

This Project will update the analysis for City of Brampton and City of Mississauga, and include both an update and have new assessment and analysis for the Town of Caledon. The assessment will characterize land cover and assess conditions for current canopy cover, analysis of canopy cover changes, and ecosystem services benefits. The update recently completed for the City of Mississauga using 2014 imagery will be used as a baseline / verification of the analysis undertaken through this project.

Prepare 2015 land cover mapping for the entire Peel Region (i.e. urban and rural areas) based on 10 classifications using 4 band satellite imagery.
The land cover mapping will identify tree canopy from forests to individual trees, other vegetated areas, bare earth, water, paved areas, roads, buildings/rooftops, shrubs, and wetland marsh.
Identify manual refinement of potential planting areas which would be unsuitable for planting, such as sports fields, golf course playing areas, airport runways, and agricultural fields.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A kick off meeting with a presentation from the students to the Project Manager and the Project Team on work plan and methodology to complete the Project.
Project is to deliver:
Land cover mapping for all of Peel Region
Data and workspaces in ESRI GIS format, mapping in pdf
Comprehensive assessment of forest canopy cover for Peel Region
Complete a statistical and spatial analysis of 2015 tree canopy cover change from between 2007 and 2015 using the land cover data for the urban areas of Brampton and Caledon. The analysis will indicate the quantity of change that has occurred and identify that identifies spatially where the gains or losses have occurred.
Produce a statistical and spatial analysis of the 2015 canopy cover for the rural areas of Caledon in the remainder of the study area.
Undertake an ecosystem services analysis that will provide separate and combined estimates of the value of the current 2015 canopy cover in the urban areas in the City of Brampton and Town of Caledon and for the rural area for the remainder of the study area in Caledon.
For the purpose of undertaking the analysis of tree canopy cover change, 2007 tree canopy cover data from the Peel Urban Forest Strategy will be provided to the Vendor.
Provide:
tabulated data of the urban forest canopy at the Area Municipal and Regional Boundary; Ward; Small Geographic Unit; Dissemination Area; and parcel level scales

<b>Project Name:</b> The Land Between Blueway Project<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Land Between region extends from Georgian Bay and Parry Sound, skirting the Algonquin Dome to Kingston. It is the headwaters for southern Ontario, and whose waters feed aquifers and streams across the southern extent of the Province and towards the Trent Severn Waterway. The Land Between also has the highest percentage of shoreline to area than anywhere in the province stemming for the abundant small lakes, rivers, wetlands, ponds and pools in Ontario clustered across the landscape. At the same time this region has the least soils with an average of less than 15cm across the land, and with much exposed bedrock. Finally, this region has no conservation authorities or broad reaching stewardship groups beyond The Land Between organization to facilitate monitoring, research, outreach and stewardship at a watershed or regional scale. Development pressure in this area is highest around shorelines for seasonal cottagers and landowners adding significantly to the pressure on sensitive lakes. Therefore these headwater lakes that are primarily cold water lake trout systems are sensitive and easily polluted or degraded due to little absorption capacity offered by shallow soils and the removal of shoreline buffers from major development. The limited relative understanding of the state of the resource and a coordinated stewardship adds to the struggle for sustaining healthy lakes.
This project represents the second and enhanced phase of The Land Between Blueway Project, which aims to map and rank those sensitive oligotrophic (lake trout) lakes in the region; and provide a portal for the public to contribute data. The project therefore assesses the relative condition of the lakes using analyses or scoring including of:

levels of Median Dissolved Oxygen (supplied by OMOECC)
levels of shoreline development (extrapolated script and modeling from existing model);
type and presence of fish stocking (data supplied by OMNRF);
This phase of the project involves importing into the database and model, all of the small lake trout lakes; running the first standardized pilot analyses and generating the first report cards; and then creating a standardized portal/entry form for anglers which will automatically feed the database.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Addition of shapefiles/attributes of the small lake trout lakes of The Land Between within the existing database/model and additional attributes/linked excel files of expected and existing Dissolved Oxygen Levels (D.O)
A pilot analysis of expected D.O. levels against existing D.O. levels
A pilot analysis of all parameters resulting in a full report card for lakes in Hastings County and if feasible across the region
A statistical correlation between the shoreline development of lake trout lakes against DO levels of the lakes

<b>Project Name:</b> Headwater Mapping 2016<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> This project seeks to extend the number of the sets of headwater map on OHMapping, the section of the OHIÔÇÖs website that provides maps for public education and awareness and which was established following a pilot mapping project completed by SSFC students in 2011/12.
Background and More Complete Description

The OHI publishes two sets of maps for a watershed. The first is a PDF with layers that show stream order, headwater catchments, and other layers of data on a clear-background PDF. The second is a rendering on Google Maps. While early maps produced by Fleming student teams (the Credit and Kawartha watersheds) were split in to 2 maps to handle the volume of data, the 2014/15 team applied a template from Derek Nader, as noted on the map of the Rouge Watershed, that accommodated all data on one map. Following the conclusion of the 2014/15 project, OHI personnel then used the template to render the map of the Grand watershed in the same format as that of the Rouge.

The objective of this Request is for a Project Team to select a watercourse to prepare data for a fifth set of maps on OHMapping. While we request consideration of either the Humber or Lake Simcoe, any other watershed between the Grand and the Kawartha and south of Lake Simcoe would be welcome.

Once the SSFC team chooses a watershed, the Project Team would develop a recommended scope of work and complete the data acquisition and/or mapping to provide the Headwaters Institute with maps for a full watershed in the spring of 2016.

As per the existing four watersheds on the OHI website, the students would be expected to provide summary data, to be shown on the PDF, depicting total watershed area, stream length, and the area in wetlands, as well as the raw data and percentage of these three features in headwater catchments. In addition, a new deliverable for 2016 shall be a data layer to depict sub-watershed boundaries, which when activated shall include the name of the sub-watershed.

Students interested in this project should be aware that all required datasets are available through LIO, and that there are summaries of the past four projects, the last one of which included guidance and comments on infrared layers of data that were helpful to the scholastic aspects of the project, although this data is not able to be included in OHI mapping due to licensing restrictions.

Finally, the Ontario Headwaters Institute will be happy to provide project vision and guidance in teleconference calls to the student team as needed. Last year, this included an informal hike of a headwater area near Lindsay, to give the team a practical orientation to the importance of headwaters, followed by a discussion in a Fleming GIS lab on team progress and perceived outcomes.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Visualization, Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Select a target watershed / CA jurisdiction between Kawartha and the Grand, and south of Lake Simcoe. to be the subject of a watershed / headwater map and summary data as described above;
Prepare an estimate of the volume of work and a project management framework assigning tasks and deadlines to the members of the Project Team;
Participate in a discussions as needed with the OHI to ensure the Project meets the goals of the OH. The Project Team will also be expected to discuss the project with College faculty to ensure it provides both meaningful practical experience for them while ensuring reasonable work-loads amongst the Project Team; and,
The provision of final data so that either the Project Team or the OHI GIS Specialist can post the maps to the OHI website.
Description of work by course requirements
Spatial data acquisition/preprocessing

Identify and acquire the geographic datasets needed to produce the maps required by the OHI, as well as any additional data to be required for reports recommended by College Faculty.
Database design/processing

Using the most recent project as a guideline, students can use the same geodatabases and modify them if required. As a final deliverable, students must provide all the map layers in ESRI shapefile format.
Spatial/statistical analysis

Spatial queries are required to determine specific metrics, including the percentage of area, stream length and wetlands covered by the headwater areas in each watershed. These metrics, as well as other potential data requested by College Faculty, are to be displayed on the PDF map of each watershed.
Cartographic presentation

A layered PDF map is required for each watershed. These maps must be presented in a printable format and with good cartographic design and layout.
The PDF map of the Credit Watershed map can be used as a guideline but students are encouraged to propose ways of improving the presentation of the maps.
In addition, a new deliverable for 2016 shall be a data layer, on both the PDF and the Google maps, to depict sub-watershed boundaries, including the name of the sub-watershed.
Web GIS

The maps also need to be displayed on a free interactive online map with the ability to turn on satellite imagery in the background, as well as all data layers (see Rouge and Grand watershed for examples).
If possible, students can propose a better method (without restrictions) of displaying the maps online.
As mentioned above, the Project Team may pursue the acquisition and/or analysis of infrared layers of LIO data for scholastic purposes as agreed by College faculty, but this data cannot to be included in final products to be posted on the OHI website due to licensing restrictions.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Wild Rice grows naturally in the Trent Severn system and throughout central and southern Ontario. The rice has an important cultural and dietary significance for First Nations communities throughout eastern North America. In the Trent Severn, wild rice abundance seems to be increasing and returning to its former distribution and density. For First Nations this is a welcome change and an indication of the health of the system. For cottagers and recreational users of the watershed, wild rice is seen as something to be reduced or eliminated from the system as it impacts their activities on the water.
This project will establish a method to monitor wild rice using aerial photography and spatial analysis using GIS software. Aerial photos will be obtained through the use of a drone and then the images will be processed using spatial analysis tools in ArcMap. Only a small area on Pigeon Lake will be used to capture these images as part of the protocol development. The scope of this project does not include the entire Trent Severn system. The student team working on this project will be required to establish how to best acquire, organize, summarize, analyze and report on the data. Once the protocol is established, then the intent will be to implement the protocol for ongoing monitoring of the distribution and abundance of wild rice in the Trent Severn system.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Visualization Component: Maps of historical distribution of wild rice and current distribution of wild rice in the Trent Severn system
Data Acquisition/Pre-processing Component: Aerial photos of areas where wild rice is present in Pigeon Lake

<b>Project Name:</b> Visualization of ecological data collected at fixed sampling sites over time<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> In ecology, data are frequently collected using networks of fixed sampling stations deployed across an area of interest. The goal of these studies is generally to explore how a variable of interest changes over both space and time. While the statistical methods used to analyze these data are well established, visual representation of the data is difficult as the variable will vary in both space (across the extent of the sampling stations) and time (over the study period). The usual methods of representation (i.e. graphs and maps) can generally show the variable across either space or time but not both simultaneously.
For the purpose of both data exploration and the public presentation of those data, animated representations that show the data across space and time are extremely effective. However, they are often difficult to produce, especially if the investigator is not well versed in GIS. An open source tool that is capable of taking a spreadsheet of data records that are referenced both spatially and temporally and outputting an animated video file would be extremely valuable.

As a component of my PhD thesis work, I collected deer behavioural data using a pair of trail camera networks. One network was placed in an area where hunting takes place and the other was placed in an area with no hunting. Each network consisted of 25 stations with a motion sensitive trail camera and a pile of deer feed at each station. The cameras ran from Oct. to Dec. in 2012. Photos were collected at the rate of 1 frame/second. Each time a deer was in front of the camera that deerÔÇÖs behaviour was recorded for each frame. Deer behaviour was scored as either scanning, feeding or other (moving, interacting with other deer, etc.). By comparing how much time deer spent scanning compared to the other activities, it is possible to estimate the degree to which the deer felt at risk of being killed by a deer hunter at that particular location and time. The goal of this study is to see how this risk changes over time and space, as well as for different deer (age, sex, group size, etc.).

This project offers a very complex example of the data that could be visualized with the proposed tool. Several of my colleagues working on snow depth monitoring and water levels within bogs have expressed interest in the tool.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Programming, Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The group would be expected to produce an open source tool that, based on an input dataset with records representing observations at georeferenced sampling stations over time, could:
Enable the user to filter the dataset based on non-spatial or temporal attribute fields. For example, for my data I may want to filter the dataset to only display the risk values from adult male deer.
Allow the user to set the rate at which the data are displayed, the length of time (temporal window) over which the data are averaged or summed and the time period over which images are created (temporal extent). While I may want to display data summed over an hour with a time step of an hour for two weeks prior to the hunt to two weeks following the hunt, displayed at a frame rate of 10 frames per second other users may be interested in seeing their data averaged or summed over a month, advanced by day, to show a whole year, at a rate of 30 frames a second.. These examples are only two of many possible display permutations and therefore the tool would be required to have a well thought out interface for defining display attributes.
Allow the user to symbology for the data much as symbology is specified in ArcGIS. For example, each site could have an icon with the size corresponding to the size of the effect or alternately a continuous surface could be generated by inverse distance weighting or kriging the data between sampling stations.
Early versions of the tool should use point symbols; for which we wish to see design proposals from the project team.
Subsequently, the team should propose how to map data as a surface interpolated, possibly by kriging or simple inverse distance weighting, and implement this if time allows.
Overlay the data on a base map or imagery which would portray other features which may be important to understanding the distributions and patterns of the data of interest.
Display the animation for the user. Early versions of the tool could include only a top down view of the area of interest. If feasible the final version would include a three dimensional view displaying the data as a series of peaks and values
Export the animated visualization as a video file.
Provide the tool in a stand-alone open source format that does not require internet connectivity.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Agriculture in The Southeast Kawartha Lake Triangle Landscape<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Fleming College geomatics program students have made substantial contributions to the systematic collection of local and provincial agricultural landscape information over the past several years. They have met the challenges provided to them by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) with great enthusiasm as they developed and refined their geomatics skill sets. A student team in 2011-12 developed the first mobile mapping technology applications for collecting field-by-field agricultural cropland observations with portable GISenabled rugged computers using ESRIÔÇÖs ArcPad 10. A 2013-14 student group built the first multi-temporal detailed agricultural landscape polygon framework from high-resolution (20cm) orthoimagery for both 2008 and 2013 for the ÔÇ£Lindsay-360ÔÇØ project area of the City of Kawartha Lakes (K-Lakes). That team digitized agricultural and rural landscape features in a seamless polygon framework following the development protocols of OMAFRAÔÇÖs Ontario Agricultural Resource Inventory (AgRI). They also used the Ontario AgRI mobile mapping technology to conduct a focused field mapping campaign across that project area to collect observations for the crops grown in this area for the 2014 cropping season. In 2015, another Fleming College student team advanced this Kawartha Lakes agricultural landscape project even further. They produced both 2008- and 2013-version digital polygon framework versions of their ÔÇ£Central Ontario ArrowheadÔÇØ project mapping area. They challenged the digitizing procedures to be augmented by an automated classification approach in order to expedite the production of the detailed polygon framework. They also produced a very solid 2015 crop map product based on ground-truth field work and timely use of a quadcopter drone equipped with a GoPro camera. This strong foundational legacy of Ontario AgRI development, built by Fleming College geomatics students, has paved the way for new project opportunities for a new student team to propel this important work even further.
Agriculture dominates the K-Lakes landscape south of the Precambrian Shield (northern 1/5th of the municipality). The land area of the southeastern corner of K-Lakes takes the shape of a triangle. It is bounded by eastern bank and shore of the Pigeon River and Pigeon Lake, respectively, on the west. The K-Lakes boundaries with Peterborough County on the east and south form those sides of this triangle region. This project will focus on developing detailed geomatics map products and analyses of this "Southeastern Kawartha Lakes Triangle" (Southeastern K-L Triangle) agricultural landscape. Students with strong interests in integrating GIS, mobile mapping, programming, remote sensing and cloud technology applications will be challenged to build an interactive, multi-temporal suite of agricultural map products that showcases the power of the Ontario AgRI polygon framework core and its cropping season-specific mobile mapping results for crop type distribution patterns.

You will be provided with many geomatics information and technology resources for this project. These include the Ontario AgRI polygon framework and the 2014 and 2015 cropping season field observation databases developed previously by Fleming students. You will be able to use the South-central Ontario Orthophotography Project (SCOOP) 2013 high-resolution colour imagery (20cm pixels) and the Digital Raster Acquisition Project for the East (DRAPE 2008) imagery (20 cm) to build the Ontario AgRI polygon framework for the ÔÇ£Southeastern Kawartha Lakes TriangleÔÇØ project area. This will permit both 2008-version and 2013-version polygon framework products to be developed. A change detection layer, that highlights all landscape feature changes that occurred between 2008 and 2013, will then be crafted. You will also be provided with a rugged, field portable, GPS-enabled Panasonic ToughBook tablet computer for use in a time-limited field mapping campaign for Spring 2016. The ArcPad 10 software script used for Ontario AgRI observation capture will be available for use and programming enhancement for this project. You will also be challenged to adapt ESRIÔÇÖs new ÔÇ£CollectorÔÇØ application and cloud technology to facilitate Ontario AgRI field observation information collection. OMAFRA personnel and vehicles will facilitate this ÔÇ£blitzÔÇØ mapping effort. A quadcopter UAV drone with a GoPro video camera mount will also be made available for technology application testing. Students with remote sensing skills will be encouraged to use a suite of multitemporal satellite imagery products and available ground truth observation data to evaluate the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada annual national crop map results for the Arrowhead study area for the 2011 to 2015 time window.

This project will challenge a student team to pool their collective talents. They will focus their time expanding and refining their geomatics skills sets to craft an suite of geomatics products and mobile mapping approaches. Their map products will remain with the College and be showcased across Ontario as an enduring legacy story of both this regionÔÇÖs agricultural landscape and the strength of the students who represent this Fleming College program.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Programming, Visualization, Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A detailed, high-resolution Ontario AgRI digital polygon framework coverage that builds upon the 2014 Lindsay-360 and the 2015 ÔÇ£Central Ontario ArrowheadÔÇØ project area products to cover the ÔÇ£Southeastern Kawartha Lakes TriangleÔÇØ region. Both 2013-version and 2008-version AgRI polygon framework products will be crafted concurrently. A change detection layer for the 2008-2013 time window will also be crafted. This work fits well under the ÔÇ£Data/Acquisition/PreprocessingÔÇØ course requirement as geospatial data is crafted via this polygon framework development work.
A Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol will be developed, described and provided as a brief summary report to outline the effort made to review these Ontario AgRI digital polygon framework products to ensure they are of high quality.
Detailed metadata records will be crafted to accompany these geomatics products to credit your work to build them and the sources upon which they are built. The Land Information Ontario metadata record protocol will be provided to guide this work.
Develop a detailed spatial/statistical analysis of the agricultural landscape feature classes covered in the ÔÇ£Southeastern Kawartha Lakes TriangleÔÇØ study area for the 2008- and the 2013-version polygon framework products and for the 2008-2013 time window ÔÇ£Change DetectionÔÇØ layer. Both table-form and pie-chart representations of the relative percentages of each feature class within the study area footprint will be produced for each polygon framework version.
Your cartographic talent and skill will be put to use in crafting three map products at this point based on your digitizing work. The 2008- and 2013-version polygon framework map products will also include your pie-charts to convey the relative percentages of each feature class from your analyses of your digitizing results. You will also craft a map of the 2008-2013 change detection results.
The current Ontario AgRI field mapping campaign ArcPad 10 script will be provided to your team. If you are interested in covering the ÔÇ£ProgrammingÔÇØ course project requirement, you are welcome to improve on this script and even develop a version specific to the diversity of the agricultural landscape of this part of K-Lakes. This will permit your group to explore programming in ArcPad 10. You are also welcome to explore programming by crafting an alternative means of observation collection with ESRIÔÇÖs newer product called ÔÇ£CollectorÔÇØ. For both of these programming approaches, you will also explore your course ÔÇ£Database Design/ProcessingÔÇØ requirement as your ultimate outcome is to ensure immediate population of the Ontario AgRI annual cropping system database. You will explore the existing Ontario AgRI database, critique it and improve on its structure and functionality. The ÔÇ£cloudÔÇØ aspects of ESRIÔÇÖs ÔÇ£CollectorÔÇØ technology package will necessitate interface facilitation and possible modifications to the Ontario AgRI database structure. The deliverable for this project avenue would be a beta test approach to a ÔÇ£CollectorÔÇØ Ontario AgRI ArcPad 10-equivalent for observation information capture and a proof-of-concept Ontario AgRI database mock-up for retrieval of the cloud-based intermediate data storage.
Remote sensing image classification product results have been developed for the 2011 through 2015 cropping seasons for this Southeastern Kawartha Lakes Triangle project study region and the rest K-Lakes. These crop interpretations are made publicly available by an Agriculture and Agri-food Canada remote sensing science team each year. You will clip out the K-Lakes footprint coverage for each these 5 cropping seasons and craft rasterbased Ontario AgRI-equivalent maps for each of them. As a second annual AAFC crop map-associated deliverable, you will overlay the current Ontario AgRI polygon framework coverage (2013-version) for the KLakes area over those raster products in order to evaluate them. This work will involve attribution of the different crop and landscape feature type interpretation rasters to their associated farm field and other polygons within the Ontario AgRI framework. A similarity/difference assessment of the 2015 Ontario AgRI information collected by the ÔÇ£Central Ontario ArrowheadÔÇØ project team students with these RS-interpreted results for this region will provide opportunity for Spatial/Statistical Analysis. It also provides a means of added value crop attribution to the fields of that polygon coverage area for crops that were either not yet planted or not viewable along sight-lines from public access roadways. Maps and associated statistical analyses of the similarities/differences between the 2015 cropping season mapping results are the deliverable for this project component.
In Spring 2016, after snow melt and as the earliest of the 2016 season crops are being planted, you will have the opportunity to beta test the ÔÇ£CollectorÔÇØ Ontario AgRI cropping system information observation application and associated cloud and database development scheme. A GPS-enabled Panasonic Toughbook rugged tablet computer will be provided with which to use the current or modified ArcPad 10 mapping script. OMAFRA staff and vehicle support will be made available for a time-limited field mapping blitz. Training in crop recognition at this early season time will be provided. The deliverables for this activity will be a body of georeferenced 2016 cropping system observations that have been captured with mobile mapping technology, storage of them in the Ontario AgRI 2015 cropping season database layer, an associated metadata record and a map of the study area coverage that has been accomplished by the time of the course project completion date. By that time, some of the local 2016 corn and soybean crop may have been available for observation.
An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) quadcopter drone will be made available for use in cropland observations that are out-of-sightline from public access roadways. It will be available for a limited time period in the Spring 2016 blitz mapping effort. The deliverable associated with this activity will be a short photo-documented report showing that each team member has gained experience operating the UAV drone, collecting Ontario AgRI observations and creating of the resulting Ontario AgRI crop map product for the project mapping area. A map that identifies where this drone technology or another remote sensing technology would have to be deployed to make observations or from which interpretations could be made in order to develop a fully-attributed map product will also be crafted. Associated statistical summary information for this ÔÇ£eye-in-the-skyÔÇØ portion of the project map area will also be developed.
A ÔÇ£web technologyÔÇØ portion of this project can be met with the ESRI Collector application and cloud portion of this project. If the student team has members with particular web tech talents, they are most welcome to develop a beta-version web-based application whereby farmers can access the digital polygon framework and populate their land management information from their home computers to populate the Ontario AgRI database for a particular cropping season. The deliverable will be either a concept diagram that explains what is needed and how it would all work together to make this farmer-input crowd sourcing application work or an operational beta version of it for the Kawartha Lakes Ontario AgRI coverage areas.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Potential Streams in Bancroft District<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Many streams have not been captured in the corporate data set. These linear water features were originally digitzed by photo interpretation at a 1:10000 scale. Smaller streams and underground streams have been missed and yet are important for Forest Management Planning and Brook Trout Feeder Creeks.Preliminary experimentation with using ArcMap analysis tools on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM v2.0) produced some promising results. These results were high potential drainage corridors that potentially represent streams. A crude map (using colour to highlight high accumulations of rain) was used in the field to direct and concentrate search efforts. Some streams previously unmapped were found and GPS data was collected.

<b>Project Name:</b> Asset Management Toolset for Sanitary Sewer dataset<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The goal of this project is to provide the Town of Cobourg with an Asset Management Tool for capital and operating forecasting and devaluation of the sanitary sewer system. In 2012 the Town of Cobourg will be undertaking the task of implementing City Works which is a work order software. It ties in with PSAB asset management requirements but doesnt fulfill the valuation requirements. In doing some research about available tools it was found that the field of municipal GIS is lacking a really well rounded valuation and capital forecasting toolset yet it is a major requirement of municipalities to report on these things about our assets (an asset being anything the municipality owns ex: manholes catch basins hydro poles street signs pavement sidewalks playground equipment etc).While we will be continuing to look for toolsets while this project is underway we recognize the creativity that could come from students and also the great work experience this will be for a group of students. Recently York Region posted a position whose main task is to build and implement asset management tools for the region.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Database Design/Processing- Programming/Customization- Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A tool or toolset to be used in Access DB and ArcEditor for capital/operating forecasting and devaluation of sanitary sewer infrastructureSomething that allows for queries or models to be run to automatically calculate devaluation of an asset or group of assets (i.e. one pipe section or all the pipe sections in a specific road section based on existing accounting info) and then from that have the option to run another model that could create a forecastFor the Capital forecast we may work with you to create levels like a refurbish or a replace forecast based on some blanket input questionsThe output could be in two formats the first being a simple stats table the second being a formal report sheet (we can supply an example or you could make it up)If possible scalable to other datasets (i.e. storm sewer street signs water roads parks equipment etc.)Query and report tool for use in ArcGIS Server web application basically the same as above but deployable online choose an asset or group of assets and calculate the devaluation or choose a group of assets and produce a capital forecastDetailed processes and procedures i.e. the processes and procedures you used to create the tools<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Survey Site Analyzer<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> One project of the Water Resource Information Program (WRIP) is the generation of large-scale Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This work involves research with soft-copy photogrammetry methods filtering and classification of elevation points field survey data analysis and dataset integration among other processes. This proposed project focuses on the elevation data obtained from field surveys which is used as part of the QA/QC process when testing DEMs. There are many organizations which collect topographic points and/or ground control points (GCPs) to augment their databases. However we find that there is currently no method to discover obtain or centrally store datasets containing topographic points. As such we have identified a need for a centralized ├óÔé¼╦£living repository to retain distribute and collect up-to-date elevation data from multiple organizations within the MNR and outside partners such as conservation authorities and other ministries. WRIP is requesting students to develop a solution which will allow partner organizations to discover existing data and have the ability to either download the data or to request it from the data owner.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Ontario Stream Sediment Survey - Geospatial Analysis of Chemical Contaminants in Stream Sediments from across Ontario<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Background: The Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) has collected ~2300 stream sediment samples from across southern Ontario from the Windsor Area in the west to the Cornwall area in the east and north to the Georgian Bay / Algonquin area. Together with Conservation Ontario and OGS the Ministry of the Environment has analyzed or had analyzed a subset of approximately 400 samples for a suite of organic contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) polychlorinated dioxins &amp; furans (PCDD/Fs) flame retardants and pesticides. The OGS has analyzed all samples for a suite of metals.This dataset provides a unique opportunity to utilize geospatial analysis techniques to explore factors contributing to observed chemical and/or metals contaminant concentrations assisting in state of the environment reporting and prioritizing future actions.To initiate the analysis it is necessary to use GIS tools to:Build a file geodatabase of potential source contributors with watersheds for each of a selected sub-set of sites. These may include various industrial sectors and types of industries waste management operations brownfields rail and road transportation heating/power generation as examples.Build a file geodatabase of potential land-use census-based indicators within watersheds for each of a selected sub-set of sites. These may include urban/industrial/commercial/agricultural land-use population dwelling counts impervious surface etc as examples.Either of these tasks may be a project on their own or can be combined into one. Depending on the progress of the project and the skill set of the participants the next step will be to test either variable set (or both) using statistical approaches such as land-use regression correlation analysis proximity analysis etc. The aim is to evaluate the data analysis approach(es) before expanding to the dataset as a whole.;Examine the provided contaminant concentration data and site information for accuracy missing informationCreate and present tables charts and cartographic outputs of the results of for example contaminant information incorporating existing sediment quality guidelines illustrative land-uses and other aspects recommended by the studentsA file geodatabase and set of layers of potential point source influences within and specific to the selected sub-set of watersheds upstream of sampling sites for test analyses with chemical contaminant data.Where necessary appropriately scale variable for incorporation into data analyses (e.g. km of road or rail # of employees of facilities area of facilities etc)A file geodatabase of land-use and census-based parameters specific to the selected sub-set of watersheds upstream of sampling sites for test analyses with chemical contaminant data.Where necessary calculate land-use percentages for sub-watersheds upstream of sampling sitesConduct spatial analyses of contaminant data in conjunction with land-use features (e.g. urban industrial rural forested agriculture) and potential point source information (industry sectors dichargers) using a variety of techniques (e.g.):proximity analysis correlations land-use regressioncorrelations<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Rural Lambton Stewardship Network Restoration Project Interactive Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Rural Lambton Stewardship Network (RLSN) is one of 46 stewardship councils in Ontario. It was established in 1994 as the pilot program for Ontario Stewardship. Since that time RLSN has taken a grassroots approach to stewardship by allowing leaders in the community to be involved in natural resource decision making. The goal of RLSN is to achieve and maintain a healthy and sustainable rural environment that will contribute towards both the viability of agricultural and natural resources in Lambton County as well as the social and economic well-being of its residents.RLSN has focused its efforts of habitat restoration conservation and enhancement (including tallgrass prairie wetland and tree and shrub habitat restoration). Information about approximately 200 of these projects has been organized in a Microsoft Access database (species planted partners involved project costs in-kind contributions restoration activities etc.). This existing database has querying abilities and reports about variables can be created but it is not connected to a GIS platform. Spatial data has been collected with GPS for many of the projects to varying degrees others have spatial boundaries showing restoration features that have been digitized by hand in ArcGIS. Organizing all of this information so that it can be easily searched by project type species planted project costs funding sources partners involved hectares restored region and location etc. would help the RLSN staff have access to information for year-end reporting creating grant proposals and identifying habitat corridors or areas that could be restored in the future<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Programming/Customization- Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students will create an interactive map application that integrates information from the Microsoft Access stewardship project database and the ArcGIS spatial data. This application should be searchable by several variables (including those listed above and a final list to be determined by the student and client). The search results should be displayed on the interactive map and in tables with column totals where appropriate. RLSN staff should be able to enter new projects into the application as well. It would be most efficient if the new data could be entered into one place (the existing Microsoft Access database would be ideal) when updating the application. An instruction manual explaining how to use the system and how to maintain this system (for new RLSN staff who will have varying levels of GIS experience) should be included. This manual should also include forms for data input and output including an explanation of how they are used.An additional feature could also be the ability to upload photos associated with each project. For example if a project is selected on the map a photo could also be viewed.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> GeoExplorer Cemetery Application<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Municipalities normally maintain and administer cemeteries within their jurisdiction. For the most part the records regarding these locations are on paper plans dating back hundreds of years. They have difficulty keeping these records like most document management systems in a paper format and would like a simpler way to manage these. A cemetery may seem like a fairly small project for most. But from a spatial connotation it is quite unique. There is the concept of family plots as well as plots that are vertical in nature. Family members are often buried together or vertically in nature. There are those locations that have special locations for cremation tombs as well as being able to reserve plots for people. Those that have memorials or grave stones also must be identified. ;The purpose for this project is to: Determine the needs of a municipality. It would be beneficial to interview different municipalities of different sizes to see what challenges they have in dealing with cemeteries. Once the needs assessment is complete a database definition needs to be prototyped and architecture for GeoExplorer needs to be completed. Attribution must be carefully considered to capture all relative information. People trying to trace their family tree or to locate a loved one may only have partial information. The GeoExplorer model will then need to be built. A municipality will be selected to use this application for trial purposes to test the application. ;Data Acquisition/Preprocessing<br>Database Design/Processing<br>Spatial/Statistical Analysis<br>Programming/Customization<br>Presentation/Visualization<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Staff and Student Commuting at Fleming College<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Fleming College is committed to reducing GHGs from transportation. Currently we have calculated GHGs from intercampus travel and would like to calculate Scope 3 carbon emissions for staff/student commuting/travel to work/school. Parking permit information (e.g. address, postal code, campus site) is available from the parking software. The project would be correlating this date to spatial maps, calculating the travel distance and related GHGs (Fleming uses a modelling formula for GHGs and this would be provided ). If possible, an additional scope would be a web interface (which could be housed on our website) where staff and faculty can input information and calculate their GHGs - carbon footprint for commuting or intercampus travel.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Cultural Mapping<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> There are two components to this project.
1/ The first is to update and modify the mapping categories of local cultural assets for the Tangible Cultural Maps. A preliminary excel database for the tangible cultural maps that will be a digital live portal. The database was created in 2013 and geocoding of the entries was completed. However it is now not up-to-date and the categories need to be modified so that they are more consistent with the format that is generally used in municipal Cultural Maps across the country. The instructions for re-categorization have been completed. Additionally sub-sets of the Tangible Cultural Maps should be created (because the entire municipality of Kawartha Lakes is so large) to produce location-based hard copies of the maps for tourists who are visiting specific areas such as Bobcaygeon, Fenelon Falls, or the Bethany area.

The overall goals for this component of the project are:

update the database
sort entries from the various categories of cultural assets and move to other specified categories
create location-based sub-sets of the data in order to produce hard copies of the maps for some of the towns and visitor areas in Kawartha Lakes
2/ The second component is to create a ÔÇ£prototypeÔÇØ framework for the Intangible Cultural Maps that will be an online digital map series using ESRI software. The Intangible Cultural Maps are a location-based presentation of ÔÇÿstoriesÔÇÖ that illustrate the history and cultural identity of the municipality. They go beyond factual history books by connecting stories and events to places and offer the opportunity to incorporate multi-media components such as photographs, audio files, video files as well as text in pop-up boxes. Multiple stories or perspectives can be entered for one location or event.

The goals of this component are to:

Explore and select or create templates for the intangible map series
create or select icons and other tools such as time lines that can be integrated into the maps to most effectively communicate intangible culture content
enter preliminary samples of stories and associated material that have been gathered into the templates, test and modify where necessary to maximize the presentation of the information<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Visualization, Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> 1/ Tangible Cultural Maps

an updated geo-coded database that is current and reflects the cultural categories that are traditionally used in municipal Cultural Maps that can be utilized for the CityÔÇÖs online digital maps that are to be launched mid-2015
sub-sets of the database that identify cultural assets and resources around targeted communities and localities to produce hard copies of these maps
potentially, the creation of a spatial database
2/ Intangible Cultural Maps
prototype templates for the cityÔÇÖs Intangible Cultural Map series that can be utilized to enter the stories and events that are currently being collected in Kawartha Lakes communities
test runs of the templates using existing stories on the CollegeÔÇÖs system (electronic or printed examples?)<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Geocommunity Web Site and Database Re-design<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Fleming College GIS program's geocommunity web site was originally developed as a site for alumni of the Cartography program. For years the site served as a means for alumni to keep track of each other and advertise jobs. Ten years ago the site was modified to include collaborative projects for current and past students of the GIS Specialist programs. The site serves as a location for clients and students to view information about the course requirements. It allows clients to submit a project request and students to bid on projects they are interested in undertaking. The web site is a MySQL database with PHP used to provide functionality and maintain the database. It is hosted offsite to allow students and clients access away from the college.
The GIS department would like the web site appearance modernized to reflect current standards in web site design. In addition a number of enhancements to the web site need to be included. Enhancements include, but are not limited to:

simpler presentation of project and course information
better security for database access and website
improving separation between the public only view, the members view and the administrative view
addition of a visual/graphic description of past projects including links to sites containing work developed by past projects

<b>Project Name:</b> On-line Mapping Tool for Archaeologically Surveyed Properties in Ontario<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Heritage Operations Unit of the Ontario Ministry of Culture (MCL) plays a regulatory role licensing all archaeological activities in the province. One of the conditions of holding a licence is that researchers notify the MCL of archaeological work they will be undertaking as well as providing reports documenting all archaeological activities conducted in the field. For this reason the MCL has the most complete archaeological library documenting the survey of properties and the investigation of sites in Ontario. The MCL also maintains a database of all the archaeological site information and currently there are 50+ fields of data for each of the 17000 + known archaeological sites across the province. For the past 8 or 9 years the MCL has used a GIS to track archaeological site locations allowing us to inform archaeologists if the known sites are in proximity to projects they are involved in. While the archaeological site data is already in a usable digital format any information about where researchers have looked for sites ("archaeologically assessed lands") is information that only resides in archaeological reports as well as paper maps associated with project notification forms (called Project Information Forms or "PIF's"). A pilot project conducted in 2005 researched methods for converting archaeologically assessed spatial data from existing hardcopy reports. It was concluded that it is more efficient to acquire this information initially in the digital format rather than converting archaeologically surveyed data from hardcopy reports later. The goal of the MCL 2006 project then will be to create an on-line interface that researchers can use to define which lands they will be archaeologically assessing<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The project involves designing and implementing a web interface which will:allow a pre-registered user to login;allow a user to fill in an online PIF and when submitted would populate the MCL's ArchLRB database with information. Geographical information derived from the spatial information should be used to calculate the entries of geographical fields (i.e. system should calculate county and township info);provide the user with an online map (once required fields on the PIF are submitted). The map should become increasingly detailed at higher zoom levels;prompt the user to find his/her study area on the online map the user would be prompted to define a polygonal area that they will be archaeologically assessing;allow the user to confirm that the defined area is accurate; andgenerate a unique identifier for the polygon and relate the spatial information to this identifier.measure the association of assessed land known archaeological sites to various physiographic criteria produce a formal presentation for MCL staff If the students were able complete the items above and had time leftover it would be valuable if they could build the following functionality:the user should be able to upload GPS or COGO co-ordinates representing the boundaries the properties surveyed and in this instance the information should replace the spatial information acquired earlier; andmodify the database so that once an assessment polygon is defined the polygon is buffered by a specified distance (i.e. 2 or 5 km) select previously reported sites within the buffer create a low resolution reference map and create a report of the sites within the buffered distanceuse a GPS unit to acquire boundary information and then test the web application by uploading the GPS information to it.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> A web-based dryland degradation assessment system based on the FAO/UNEP LADA framework<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) began a global project for land degradation assessment in drylands (LADA) in order to comply with the millennium assessment goals. Trent University researchers (R. Ponce and R. Dixon) participated actively in the design of the LADA project methodology and in case studies. Today the LADA project is being implemented in a range of countries with dryland environments (e.g. China Senegal South Africa Argentina and Mexico) and lately in the Middle East. The LADA methodology is based on the Driving Forces-State-Pressure-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach and relies on indicator variables for each of the DPSIR to conduct an assessment. Such indicators vary from country to country from one scale to another and from each of DPSIR. At present stakeholders conducting an assessment of the state of degradation of drylands in their jurisdictions cannot count on an automated tool to enable them speed of processing of an assessmentThus researchers stake-holders and decision-makers need access to a spatial decision support system that offers a comprehensive database of indicators of land degradation from which to choose those applicable to their areas of assessment then access an indicator processing and integration engine or tool to combine and integrate these indicators into an assessment reflected in an appropriate legend code in a map including also possible causes of the degradation processes (using the DPSIR approach).The project thus consist of developing an Internet-based spatially explicit system which would allow users anywhere in the planet for a given geographic area (initially the size of a district) access to a list of potential land degradation indicators from a comprehensive database (already defined) to select the appropriate indicators. Then access an indicator processing and integration engine or tool to combine these indicators (possibly a weighted linear combination of the indicators selected that reflects their degree of importance in the region or area) and finally a map display mechanism or tool that allows for the spatial display of the assessment results in map form all of which is carried out through the internet<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Implementing an ArcIMS Application for Assessing Air Quality<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Within the Ministry of the Environment one of the program delivery areas for Operations division air monitoring surveys auditing of third party air monitoring and assessing compliance of facilities that emit air contaminants. Both the regional and district offices play fundamental roles in delivering these programs. The findings of air quality studies from a wide range of clients including the public provincial and federal government and regional health offices and the results of provincial air monitoring network (which include Air Quality Index stations) record the concentration of pollutants that may adversely affect human and animal health vegetation and the use and enjoyment of property. Through the program compliance with ambient air quality criteria is tracked and long-term air quality trends are determined. The program is also successful in identifying pollution sources and assessing the results of pollution control measures. A component of the air compliance program is Selected Targets for Air Compliance (STAC). The STAC program requires selected facilities to submit an Emission Summary and Dispersion Modeling (ESDM) report that is used as a desk-top verification of compliance with Ontario air pollution regulations. More specifically the program is intended to assess the predicted aggregate effect of all emissions from a facility as if it were running a maximum capacity and to determine whether those predicted concentrations are within the standards and guidelines. When a facility is predicted to emit contaminants beyond an acceptable level the Ministry may require the emitter to put in place a plan that details specific actions to be taken over a specific timeframe to achieve the necessary compliance. While the STAC database is continually being updated the database continues to lack any spatial component. A number of records are identified with spatial coordinates however this is not required information and many are lacking this information. Once in place the spatial coordinates represent an opportunity to incorporate the STAC database into a GIS environment. A linkage between the STAC database and GIS would give a user direct access to view the information stored within the database. This linkage would allow various stakeholders within the Ministry to have access to the database and visualize the location of the STAC facilities by overlaying the information with other spatial datasets (i.e. roads wetlands schools etc.) as well as orthoimagery. The GIS component of the STAC program should also allow for a spatial analysis whereby a user can view the spatial relationship between a facilitys dispersion model results and the neighboring environment allowing for an assessment of potential risks to air quality. The objective of this project is to develop an ArcIMS application that will: Allow a user to access the STAC database through a web-based siteIncorporate air dispersion modeling results Allow for a spatial analysis to be performed using dispersion modeling results and a comprehensive list of spatial data layersReport and summarize STAC information as well as analysis results in maps chart and table formats.Incorporating the STAC database into a GIS system will allow staff within the Ministry to more readily interpret and analyze it. The initial project will focus on the STAC program but may also be extended to other air compliance and monitoring programs such as OnAir and the ESDM requirements for the recently promulgated Regulation 419.;A user-friendly ArcIMS application which will: Updated STAC database with Geographic (Decimal Degrees - 6 decimal places) coordinates.ArcIMS site to be in Lambert Conformal Projection (Provincial Ministry Standards File will be provided) and have a point and click tool that reports the UTM zone Easting and Northing.Allow potential users within the Ministry of Environment to visualize the locations of facilities and air monitoring stations with the capability of linking these spatial representations to any corresponding air quality data tables and/or reporting documents Report and summarize information in maps charts and tables using ArcGIS (Note: The product will possibly be modified by client in the future to add more capabilities to the application)Perform a spatial analysis of dispersion modeling results to assess potential risks to air qualityA technical report which documents the application (including software and databases) procedure findings and recommendations.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Significant Woodlands Mapping<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> We are looking for a way to identify forested areas via remote sensing to map Significant Woodlands in the Otonabee Region Conservation Authority. This can involve color matching, path recognition or digitization. From these identified forested areas, an algorithm will be supplied that will select potential significant forests from identified forested areas. We would then like the students to prepare a web application that will allow the Otonabee ecologists to review each potential significant woodland. While reviewing the woodland, the ecologist will need to grade several indicators while viewing the aerial imagery. These indicators will be the same for each woodland. An ArcGIS Online story map or web mapping application are possible options for the forest review app.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Hydrologic Controls on Vegetation cover in the Hudson Bay Lowland<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The general goals of the project are to estimate the greenhouse gas exchange between different surface cover types in a 110 km2 region of the Hudson Bay Lowland near Churchill Manitoba. Plant cover strongly influences CO2 uptake and soil wetness strongly influences decomposition and both CO2 and methane release. The proposed GIS will link changes in topography with plant cover within contiguous drainage basins and will then be used to apportion ground based flux measurements of the greenhouse gases. In polar regions water is in short supply and therefore is often limiting for plant growth. Areas of water accumulation (as in depressions) support distinctive types of flora (sedges) compared to areas that are well drained (lichens). Intermediate zones of relatively constant slope support alternate types of vegetation (mosses and vascular shrubs). Decomposition is severely limited by anoxic conditions induced by water logging. Again these are zones typically found in depressions. Near surface flow of water is controlled by elevational gradients which makes it possible to link DEM data with moisture accumulation. The relative absence or presence of accumulated water should be spatially correlated with both vegetation and the emissions of methane and CO2 from soils. Generating representative greenhouse gas fluxes from regions like the Hudson Bay Lowland requires a better understanding of the proportional contributing areas for gas uptake and release.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> LANDEAS: Web mapping system for global land degradation assessment at regional and local scales<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Land degradation is the decline or reduction of primary productivity of ecosystems and ecosystem services. Land degradation is a pressing global problem and it is present in more than 120 countries affecting over 40% (1.4 billion people) of the global population). The LADA project is a global project supported by the United Nations Environment Program and executed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) aiming at a comprehensive assessment of the global problem through developing assessment methodologies and enhancing assessment capacities in country members. Tools are required to enable assessments of land degradation allowing for the widest access and application possible of the methodology. A web-based spatially-explicit land degradation assessment tool (LANDEAS) based on the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) indicator approach has been under development jointly between FAO and GEORESLAR of Trent University. The structure and functionality of the web-based system and its modular components have been designed and partly built and ported to the internet. LANDEAS main modular components are: an indicator selection module a multi-scale area selection module supported by Google EarthTM functionality which allows for geographical display at multiple scales on the globe. The central module is an indicator processing engine (IPE) which enables the processing of DPSIR indicator values entered interactively by users or through templates. The output module displays the results of an assessment through the display of a specially designed bubble legend showing on the globe the mapping output. The Indicator Processing Engine (IPE) is made up a set of alternative algorithms to combine data on indicators entered by the user into a synthetic assessment. So far only a few alternative algorithms of linear combinations of indicators are built into the IPE of LANDEAS . Further work is required to imbed other algorithms for processing indicators for user selection into the IPE and to enhance the mapping capabilities of LANDEAS through Google EarthTM and through accepting user-supplied GIS maps such as shape files or other proprietary GIS formats provided by users for the assessment of specific areas. An assessment of the usefulness of the LANDEAS system through its testing in specific assessment areas is also required.SCOPEThe goals for the project are as follows: Update the current functionality of LANDEAS by: Add functionality for alternative approaches to combine user-suggested indicators into an assessment by coding algorithms within the Indicator Processing Engine (IPE) Develop appropriate software code to synthesize the results of an assessment from the IPE and display them as a legend in either a Google Earth Globe shape files or other proprietary GIS format Output Management: To allow users to organize store and view the output from modeling results that are generated by the assessments.Quality Assurance: Port the system to the Internet and ensure functionality under a variety of assumptions about users and technology<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Database Design/Processing- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization- Web Technology<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Kawartha Lakes Flow Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The KLSA would like to have a detailed comprehensive map of the Kawartha Lakes from Shadow Lake downstream to Katchewanooka and White Lakes showing watershed data including mean annual inflows and outflows. The key question to be addressed for each lake is:Where is our water coming from how do these sources affect water quality and finally where does the water go?The Kawartha Lakes receive water from both the north and the south and the relative amounts of north and south inflow seem to be a strong determinant of water quality. Water from the more populated limestone-bedrock areas to the south is higher in phosphorus and other chemicals typical of an agricultural and urban watershed. Water from the less populated Precambrian Shield forested areas to the north is usually lower in nutrients and other pollutants. Understanding how much water comes from where will help us understand how best to monitor water quality (where and when to test) and how to target our efforts to improve water quality. The KLSA feels that such a map would help shoreline residents better understand the close connections among the Kawartha Lakes and how a change in one lake or influent stream can affect many others downstream. Many residents believe their lake water is mainly composed of local runoff which is not the case!This map will appear in future KLSA annual reports but we hope many others will find it informative (e.g. tourism organizations cottager associations etc.). ;Base map of Shadow Balsam Cameron Sturgeon Big and Little Bald Pigeon Chemong Sandy Buckhorn Lower Buckhorn Lovesick StonyLake namesNames of rivers and streams flowing in and out of each lake showing direction of flow.Names of major townsCounty and municipal bordersDams canals and locksThis map needs to be as user-friendly as possible as we hope it will be used by other Kawartha Lake area groups for their own purposes. It would be valuable to have one version that can be easily downloaded by dial-up computers. We would very much like to have this base map by the middle of March so that it could be included in the KLSA annual report. Flow map (using above base map). This should show not only the inflows and outflows of all significant streams and other pathways but also their relative contributions to the volumes of the various lakes. For example Balsam Lake receives almost all of its water from the Gull River. However the next lake downstream Cameron Lake receives water from Burnt River so Cameron Lakes water is a mixture of the two. This adding and mixing of water continues downstream until the last lake Katchewanooka receives water directly and indirectly from 10 or more inflows. The map should give an indication of how much water in each lake comes from each inflow. Perhaps this could be done by showing each inflow as a different colour. For example Balsam Lake would be all one colour the colour of the Gull River inflow. Cameron Lake could contain two colours designating the Gull and Burnt River inflows etc. Students may have ideas as to how best to indicate the relative contributions of the various inflows.Anything that would add or remove more than one-hundredth the total volume of a lakes water over the course of the year should be included. Students would need to find out if this would include quarries golf courses or other water intakes/outputs. It would be very useful to have an additional map extending up to and including all headwaters. Minimal text explaining the maps but KLSA will add the text explaining the significance for water quality. Map of mid-summer phosphorus concentrations.

<b>Project Name:</b> Modernizing MNR Field Data Collection<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has a large role in the collection of geospatial information on Crown land. This information consists of features that we are required to track and/or protect and is referred to as a value on crown land. Information on our values is stored in a number of different repositories including provincial electronic repositories such as the Natural Resources Values Information System (NRVIS) and the Land Information Ontario (LIO) Warehouse Microsoft Access databases on district file and print servers or on personal computers. In the last several years in the Thunder Bay District MNR office field data collection has used GPS units to record the location of information but the technology available was not advanced enough to record the details about the item. Because of this GPS units are used in combination with paper forms to collect spatial locations as well as all of the required attribute information for items. In addition photos are usually taken of each item visited. There are several steps involved in the current process of values collection and several locations for associated documentation storage. This project will help to eliminate many of the unnecessary steps and improve field data collection and information management by utilizing mobile field data collection units to their full potential. Many staff members are not familiar with using modern filed data collection technologies. Technologies tested in the past have failed to meet our field data collection needs and have made staff skeptical of embracing and/or seeing the benefits. An example of a failed attempt is the purchase of the iPaq units. The battery life on these units was not adequate and they were nowhere near as rugged enough to withstand extreme hot and cold weather conditions working in the rain the occasional dousing of bug spray etc. This and other failed attempts have made further advancements in mobile field data collection very difficult. Staff have yet to see a data collection program that is easy to use trustworthy (days of data collection will not be lost) and faster than paper data collection. Many staff have put their fancy units on the shelf and reverted back to using laminated maps grease pencils and paper forms on clipboards to collect information on values in our district. This results duplication of efforts; 1- Enter the information onto a paper form 2- Enter it again into a GIS and 3- Enter or import it into an electronic database such as NRVIS 4- File the associated information appropriately. It also results in a having to go through several steps to get spatial data from each GPS unit into our corporate spatial database (the NRVIS system). A recent trial with modern data collection technologies has highlighted the value of collecting information in our corporate data format (shapefile) and has also emphasized the value of having good portable electronic data available to those working in the field. There is currently an initiative happening within the MNR to modernize field data collection. The vision is to collect information electronically and easily transfer the information into electronic central repositories. The first stage of this project which consisted of evaluating available data collection units and selecting units that best suited MNR field data collection needs is complete. Equipment has been purchased for electronic field data collection along with ArcPad software. The second stage of the project is developing a custom application to collect and maintain information on MNR values while conducting field visits.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> This project focuses to the second stage of the modernizing field data collection initiative. We require a customized ArcPad data collection application. Upon project completion this custom application will be used nearly everyday by district staff and has the potential to be used regionally and perhaps even provincially. This application should be robust enough to handle several situations that a technician or other MNR employee would likely face while collecting field data including additions (new values) and modifications and deletions to existing values. The application also needs to have a reporting function so the user can create a report after a day in the field to review all of the edits they made that day. We would also like to see photo functionality. It would be beneficial if the custom ArcPad application allowed the user to take a photo (blue tooth or integrated camera) as part of the value edit and automatically file and rename the photo based on the values unique identifier and some value to indicate how many photos there were of the particular location. Lastly a roll up tool is needed that grabs all of the data that was modified that day (additions deletions modifications and photos) filed in appropriate folders etc. to allow for easy transfer (probably via jump drive) from the data collection unit to a desktop PC. Custom ArcPad data collection forms are required. These forms will collect information that is needed for the MNR corporate database (NRVIS) (shapefile format) and district specific information (related Microsoft Access tables). Examples of what we are looking for will be provided. Note: Resolution and screen size will be discussed upon project start-up. A user friendly interface that guides a user through a value addition modification or deletion is required. In an ideal situation the user would hit a button in ArcPad when they are at a value where they would like to collect edit or delete information. Two things need to happen before the custom ArcPad form appears: 1) The user should be presented with a (Graphic User Interface) GUI that asks them which feature class they would like to edit and a drop down list of all MNR edited feature classes. This feature should automatically set the editable layer to the item selected in the drop down list. 2) The next GUI would appear that asks if this is a new value a change to an existing value or deletion of an existing value. Each would have to be handled differently. New Value ArcPad tally sheet opens and data is put into a blank new shapefile is created for each feature class with additions. (Additions could be entered into NRVIS via direct import)Change to an existing value Program would search for the nearest value (in the feature class that the user would like to edit) highlight the feature and confirm that the highlighted value is in fact the correct value they wish to edit. Once the user confirms this the ArcPad tally sheet would open with all of the existing attributes populated so the user simply has to change the fields they would like to update (i.e. verification date etc.). If the geometry of the feature was different than the existing data the user should be asked if they would like to update the geometry. This data would have to be stored in a separate shapefile because editing it in NRVIS would occur in a different fashion. NOTE: There would have to be a manual override in case the nearest feature selected is not correct. Deletions to existing features this could work similar to the way a change would work the program would search for the nearest value (in the feature class that the user would like to delete from) highlight the feature and confirm that the highlighted value is in fact the correct value they wish to delete. If it was the feature should be deleted out of the ArcPad view and moved to a separate shapefile. This shapefile could be brought into NRVIS where a select by location could be performed. Selected feature could then be deleted. NOTE: There would have to be a manual override in case the nearest feature selected is not correct. Report functionality should also be added. Users should be able to at the end of a day in the field hit the report button and generate a report of edit activity that occurred separated into additions deletions and modifications.Photo functionality It would be nice if the custom ArcPad application could in allow for someone to take a photo (blue tooth or integrated camera) as part of the value edit. This photo could be automatically filed and renamed based on Object ID and some value to indicate how many photos there were of the particular location (example 55555555-01.jpg 555555555-02.jpg). Note: users should still be able to take a photo unrelated to a value. A roll up tool should be created that grabs all of the data that was modified that day (additions deletions modifications and photos) filed in appropriate folders etc. to allow for easy transfer (probably via jump drive) from the data collection unit to the GSO or data techs PC. District specific information should be handled differently than corporate specific information. Corporate data has to be packaged for import into NRVIS district specific information has to be packaged for import into MS access. More on this item as project evolves. A data model will be provided that illustrates relations in the data and whether or not the data is corporate of district. A well written user guide is needed. This guide will serve to help the end user and will provide step by step instructions for collection values using the custom mobile data collection application. An installation package is required for both windows XP and Windows Mobile (CE). Well commented programming is required. Fleming students will not be responsible or available for the maintenance or upgrades of the application therefore well commented code is required so MNR staff will be able to take over maintenance upon project completion.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Landscape patterns of lake attribute data in support of aquatic habitat suitability analyses<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The MNRF is investigating the effects of climate change on the spread and establishment of aquatic invasive species within Ontario. Thermal habitat within a lake is an important factor in the establishment of aquatic species within a lake and is likely to be altered significantly due to climate change (e.g. increasing volume of warm water thermal habitat, and decreasing volume of cold water thermal habitat).

  A Seasonal Temperature-profile Model (STM) can be used to estimate the volume of thermal habitat within a lake using morphometric data (i.e. lake area, depth, perimeter, etc.) as input. While these data are not available for all lakes in Ontario, high quality imagery, elevation, and geologic data may be available across the province.

  For this project, we require an assessment of the feasibility of using raster/elevation/other data available across the entire province to determine individual lake morphometrics. This includes initial research into availability of data and possible methods of analysis, as well as a report on the final algorithm and its applicability across the province.<br>

<b>Deliverables:</b> -        Identify and acquire landscape features / spatial data needed to determine lake morphometrics (specifically, surface area, perimeter, maximum depth, and mean depth) at the provincial scale (all lakes &gt;40 ha).  Source data could include topography, digital elevation maps, land class, soil type, geology, imagery, etc.
-        Conduct QA/QC of all data provided and acquired for project.
-        Develop and report on a method / algorithm to estimate lake morphometrics based on geographic/geologic data for all lakes &gt;40 ha in Ontario. Report should include: rationale for selection of variables and classifications, summary analysis of lake morphometrics at various spatial scales, an evaluation of model performance, and confidence in model outputs. This summary may include tabular, graphical, and cartographic data, to be discussed as project progresses.
-         ÔÇÿMidtermÔÇÖ report (~2 pages) summarizing variables that are or are not related to lake morphometrics, possible methods for determining lake morphometrics, likelihood of methods being generalized across province, difficulties in generalizing from specific area to entire province, and key data gaps ÔÇô What data are important and what data are actually available across the province?
-        All data (input, output, metadata) will be organized into a logical database structure that could be used for future analysis.  

(1.        An algorithm to calculate lake depth, area and perimeter from inputs (may be land class, DEM, Soil Type, Geology, Slope, Imagery,) ÔÇôthe depths would be by contour lines or raster squares so can show depths within lake polygons. 
2.        A database to hold the inputs and output values for each lake
3.        A locality map of where we conducted our first couple of test lakes while creating the algorithm
4.        A heat map of Ontario based on depth, area and perimeter (time dependent))<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Generating a Watershed Information System to Support Land Use Planning in Sierra Leone<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The significance of Land Use Planning in a watershed context is increasingly recognized and implemented in jurisdictions around the world. Many of the challenges facing Sierra Leone such agricultural optimization (particularly wetland agriculture) seasonal flooding soil erosion and soil depletion could in-part be addressed through Land Use Planning with access to well structured GIS watershed layers. Sierra Leone currently has very little structured GIS data and no watershed mapping. They do however have very rich legacy hard-copy 1:50000 scale photogrammetrically derived topographic mapping. The hydrology features depicted on this mapping such as rivers steams swamps swamp cultivation and rapids represent durable landscape features that could be most productively utilized if captured and made widely accessible as GIS layers. It is believed these data could be additionally combined with satellite derived elevation data products to produce authoritative watershed layers suitable for effective and scale appropriate Land Use Planning across the country. The primary focus of this project is to develop a hydrology digitizing manual (and potentially scripts) that would enable allow local Sierra Leonean groups (and potentially others) to capture these data to recognized and enforced data standards. A secondary focus of this project is to explore the potential of integrating these automated data with remotely sensed derived elevation data products in order to develop full watershed geospatial data layers.;The central deliverable is an ArcGIS hydrology digitizing manual for automating scanned legacy 1:50000 Sierra Leonean Topographic Maps. Users of this manual may have limited GIS experience. The data model to be employed should closely resemble Natural Resources Canadas National Hydrology Network (NHN) data model. Unique characteristics of the Sierra Leone data are in-part captured in the attached PowerPoint slides (SLDigitizing.ppt).Optional - Some QA and QC scripts to error trap and flag digitizing errors. For the selected study watershed utilizing the Digitized developed hydrology data layers (point line and polygons) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 3 arc-second elevation data construct a full ArcHydro database including terrain derivates and catchments for a selected watershed.Evaluation of the appropriateness of ArcHydro Stream Burning Processes (AGREE) for terrain processing using the SRTM dataset.

<b>Project Name:</b> Heritage Properties and Conservation District Mapping Project<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The objective of this project is to develop a GIS layer of built heritage properties and heritage conservation districts from the provinces Ontario Heritage Portal (OHP) Properties module. Currently the Ministry has locational information pertaining to approximately 6500 built heritage properties such as street address municipality and upper-tier. The largest component of this project will involve using this information to geocode each property relative to the Ontario Road Network (ORN). Address information may need to be normalized through scripts to ensure all properties are successfully mapped. Areas that have been designated as heritage conservation districts would need to be spatially defined as polygons based on plans held by the Ministry of Culture.Once a complete layer of built heritage properties and heritage conservation districts has been created some spatial analysis will be required. If time permits a web-based mapping interface should be created so that a user can explore the provinces heritage properties possibly with photo links descriptions etc.;The primary deliverable is a GIS layer of geocoded properties and districts within Ontario. The other products will be a spatial analysis pertaining to the density and distribution of these properties across the province. Lastly the newly created layer will have to be added to a web-based mapping interface and customized so that a user can easily explore Ontarios built heritage .The students will be expected to give a final presentation on the application to the MCL.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Fleming College Base Map Development<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> There are several possible elements to this project.
 However the first element must be completed 
before any other parts of the project can be completed.

1) Data acquisition and data creation: using an appropriate software technology (preferably Esri's ArcGIS platform), gather and create the necessary topographic base data for any or all of the Fleming College campuses. This would include but not necessarily be limited to building footprints, roadways, water features, parking lots, trails, pedestrian walkways, trees, elevation, surface features, etc. For added detail, building interior layout (rooms, hallways, stairs) could be included as well as the development of any 3D features. Utilize existing data sources first (college building plans, etc) before embarking on data creation.
2) Assist in the migration of the data to the Community Maps data model and prepare the data for publication as part of the world topographic base map as it is hosted on ArcGIS Online.
3) Develop a 3D digital model of the campus(es) 
4) Develop a way finding / room finding app that is accessible online that would allow users to route their path through the various campus buildings in a 3D format. Ideally this would utilize Esri technology.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing - Acquiring field data/research/significant manipulation, Database Design and/or Processing - Conceptual and logical data models may be required or developed, Cartographic Presentation or Visualization - Requires significant cartographic output/visual communication, Web Technology - Requires significant configuration/or programming and online analysis.<br>

P835         R: 2015-01-16        Mapping of Vernal Pools for possible Salamander Reintroduction

And they did a good job.  However, they were working in Arcview 10, which I had been assured the board could work with.  It has turned out that it is too advanced for the school board computers. Even Arcview 9.3 has been unable to be used.
        I would like the map that the last team developed to be converted to Garmin Basecamp format and completed, and then to learn how to use it to submit sightings and records to various citizen science websites.
This would be in order to allow us to match the grade 9 &amp; 10 curriculum guidelines for GIS mapping<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Database Library Development and TLB Aquatic Resources -Waterfowl Breeding Analyses<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Database libraryKHC has identified the need to develop an advanced information management system to help organize its property data assess securement opportunities and to communicate its work to others. Key to achieving this is having access to well-organized and catalogued digital spatial base-data. Data CatalogueA data catalogue structure needs to be developed building on existing work by MNR NCC and other data partners. Data ConsolidationThird party basedata needs to be acquired and catalogued into the KHC information management system. This includes data provided by MNR CAs NRCan and othersKHC Derived DataMetadata needs to be developed for all KHC derived data. An example of this is the cultural inventory work undertaken by students in the summer of 2006. Other data includes property information priority areas farming analysis and the Land Between data sets. Map Templates and SymbolizationMap templates are needed for a variety of scales including the property level Township bioregion and Southern Ontario scales. Basedata features such as hydrology parks and toponomy needs to be symbolized and standardized. TLB Wetland mapping/shoreline quantificationIn order to facilitate improved and meaningful landscape and program planning a digital layer will be created using air photo mosaics provided and key attributes (provided as well) including wetland number and those associated with nesting activity will be tagged. The students will then conduct a spatial analysis of the shoreline relative to area for each township and contrast these to one township to the south and north of the Land Between ecotone. Analysis will be enabled through the use of waterlines/water polygons from the newly digitized resources and those provided through a data sharing agreement with OMNR for NRVIS data. Lastly waterfowl breeding activity will be analyzed using the nesting attributes/data from the Ducks Unlimited Canada and breeding potential estimated by the quantity of additional open water wetlands found in the area.More information available from Project Liaison<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Clearwater Area Recreation Opportunity Spectrum<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Albertans enjoy a great abundance of natural resources. Alberta Sustainable Resource Development (ASRD) works with Albertans across the province to ensure a balance between the economic environmental and social values of our province. We fight forest fires manage fish and wildlife oversee the development of Alberta's forests and manage the use of public lands. One aspect of ASRDs land management focus is recreation use. The Clearwater Management Area in west-central Alberta sees extensive and varied recreational use.Alberta Sustainable Resource Development (ASRD) is looking for assistance in preparing models and used to create the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS). The ROS provides information about recreation opportunities to resource managers and land use planners. The ROS identifies and classifies areas based on remoteness naturalness and expected social experience. This information not only aids in management of the resource but can provide users the ability to plan activities that suit their desires. ASRD would like to build ROS geoprocessing models for a pilot study in the Bighorn Backcountry west of Rocky Mountain House AB. These models would be used to test our parameters data inputs and ultimately the resultant ROS layers.Tools to create a Recreation Opportunity Spectrum will help us to better understand the potential that our land base has to support recreational activities. Once we understand this potential we can better manage the resource with this purpose in mind. ROS tools will also allow us to understand the impact of new and proposed developments on recreational pursuits.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> ASRD requires the following deliverables from the Clearwater Area Recreation Opportunity Spectrum project:ROS ArcGIS Geoprocessing ToolsThere are three ROS factors: Remoteness Naturalness and Social Experience. The prime deliverable of this project is a series of geoprocessing tools to assess/derive each of the ROS factors and combine them for final ROS creation. These tools need to be created using ArcGIS 9.2 (or 9.3) and may utilize ArcView ArcEditor or ArcInfo licensing. In addition to core ArcGIS functionality the tools may leverage Spatial Analyst or 3D Analyst. This functionality can be leveraged using ModelBuilder and/or Python. The use of any other software needs to be discussed an approved before proceeding.Refer to the following documents for a thorough description of the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum and the application of ROS in British Columbia:Recreation_Opportunity_Spectrum.pdfBC_ROS_Procedures_Manual.pdfAs a starting point the parameters used in the British Columbia example will be used for the ASRD ROS tools. The ability to easily change these parameters is required. As ASRD Recreation Landuse Planners have not yet determined the viability of these parameters the ability easily change them is required. It is recommended that these inputs are parameters to a model or variables at the beginning of a script.ASRD will provide the data required to create and test the ROS tools. In the event that the ROS tools require the use of datasets that arent available anticipatory data may have to be created. ASRD staff will be available assist in the creation of these datasets.All outputs from the ROS tools should be stored in a file or personal geodatabase. The design of this geodatabase shall be the responsibility of the project staff.ROS Presentation and Cartographic ProductsThere are several stakeholders that are interested in recreational opportunities in the Bighorn Backcountry both within the Government and externally. In order to test and validate the methodology used in the ROS tool creation a series of cartographic products will have to be created. These products will clearly illustrate the interim steps and the final ROS products. Creative and cartographic license will be given to the project staff as long as the above objectives are met.A presentation will need to be made to ASRD staff involved in this project. This presentation will outline the methodology technology and results of the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum tool creation.<br>

Eighty-five sampling points were established in the test grid with a spatial accuracy of 0.5 metres. The grid is composed of a variety of forest covers terrains slope conditions aspects elevations and Gap Light Index. Each sample point was inventoried for various attributes and the information was collected to allow for analysis of hotspot identification. A hotspot is a small area of smoldering or glowing combustion which may be exhibiting smoke.The grid allows testing for the detection of hotspots (sensitivity of contractor equipment) the precision of hotspot mapping (using GIS) and the efficiency of the contract operations (delivery time and data format of products). When conducting a test 20 points are randomly chosen as targets using a point generator. The heat source at each selected target is either a pile of six charcoal briquettes or a propane stove with cast iron stove top or frying pan. The time and temperature at each target is recorded every second using hobo data loggers to ensure data integrity. An infrared contractor is given the extent of the grid and asked to provide a number of information products immediately or shortly after the flight. A typical evaluation takes approximately 65 minutes. A statistical comparison is completed between the known heat sources and those identified by the infrared contractor. Confidential reports are generated for each infrared company that flies the grid.Deliverables by IR ContractorThe GRID was created in Alberta to evaluate infrared (IR) providers using High Altitude (Fixed Wing) or Low Altitude (Helicopter) platforms to detect hotspots on a simulated wildfire backdrop. IR providers are responsible to provide a number of deliverables;a) A mission report (FP 60) in agreed format;b) All vector spatial data (hotspot and breadcrumb trail) delivered in shapefile format (*.shp *.dbf *.shx *.prj). The defined datum is NAD83 and the defined projection UTM. A CD or thumb drive is an acceptable delivery media after landing.c) An assessment of the found hotspots delivered as a digital map image file (JPEG PDF or BMP file format) and a printed map product.Current SetupA number of programs are used to complete the evaluations.ArcGIS is used to extract the variety of forest covers terrains slope conditions aspects and elevations for each target on the ground. Once extracted these values normally remain static. ArcGIS is also used to manually identify and compare the IR Contractors submitted targets with the actual ground targets. Gap Light Index is gathered for each ground target using the Gap Light Analysis program and can remain static for approximately 5 years at which point needs to redone to reflect the current situation. Students would not require this software.The main program that drives this evaluation process is Microsoft Access. Microsoft Access pulls all the contractors company information and evaluation information together and spits out a report on their findings.Greenline software is used to download data that is captured by the data loggers and assign an average temperature to each ground target to ensure it was hot during the evaluation. Students would not require this software.GRID Marking Schema This is not a program but information that is gathered during the evaluation is entered into the GRID Marking Schema to determine the outcome for each IR Service Provider;Alberta would like to have this whole process run in ArcGIS either as an extension or possibly as a Tool in ArcToolBox. However we are flexible to other suggestions.Program must include a way to identify the DEM and Vegetation datasets and the ability to process for update purposes. A comprehensive report generated on the ground targets that were used for each IR Contractor on the GRID. Report would be similar to the Microsoft Access database however in would not include information on False Targets. The report would produce the GRID Marking Schema results and if an IR Service Provider was successful a form letter indicating successful completion over the GRID and a certificate would be generated. The report would also generate an unsuccessful letter to those IR Service Providers that do not make the 80% rating. The unsuccessful letter would allow for comments to be added by the evaluators on what to improve for that particular IR Service Provider. Alberta would be looking for a report that is more appealing that its present form.A map product would be generated showing the location of the ground targets in relations to the targets submitted by the IR Contractor.;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/VisualizationSince this project involves the gathering and reporting of Thermal Infrared information students may want to learn a little about how infrared is used in the suppression of wildfires.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Designing and Testing Automated and Semi-Automated GIS Processes to Aid the Development of a Watershed Information System for Sierra Leone<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The significance of Land Use Planning in a watershed context is increasingly recognized and implemented in jurisdictions around the world. Many of the food security and environmental challenges facing Sierra Leone such agricultural optimization (particularly wetland agriculture) seasonal flooding soil erosion and soil depletion could in-part be addressed through Land Use Planning with access to well structured GIS watershed layers. Sierra Leone currently has very little structured GIS data and no watershed mapping. They do however have very rich legacy hard-copy 1:50000 scale photogrammetrically derived topographic mapping. The hydrology features depicted on this mapping such as rivers steams swamps (points) swamp outlines (polygons) swamp cultivation (points) and rapids represent durable landscape features that could be productively utilized if captured and made widely accessible as structured GIS layers. It is believed these data could be additionally combined with satellite derived elevation data products (ASTER and SRTM) to produce authoritative watershed layers suitable to support effective and scale appropriate Land Use Planning across the country. It is believed an investment in the structured automation of these data would bring Sierra Leones digital GIS watershed fabric comparable to products we are operationally utilizing in Ontario Canada and indeed many North American jurisdictions. In 2009 a Fleming Application Specialist group  successfully develop a series of training materials (including laboratory exercises manuals data models GeoDatabases on-screen voice-over instruction tutorials etc) to help standardize and coordinate hydrology feature (line point and polygon) automation from existing 1:50000 scale scanned Sierra Leonean topographic maps (all materials to be provided). This winter term the curriculum developed by this group will be utilized within the Fleming Geomatics Technician program as part of a major project with their GEOM20 Course (GIS Applications). Each student (approximately 30 students) will be tasked will digitally capturing the hydrology features for a manageable sub-watershed. This course will be taught by Hal Ward. It is envisioned that with success in this first run an ironed-out process can also be exported to the universities (under the direction of government departments) in Sierra Leone for implementation in their new GIS facility. It is believed that with the efforts of a couple generations of undergraduate students (both Fleming and Sierra Leonean) it will be possible to fully generate a full 1:50K Watershed Information System for Sierra Leone comparable to what we current have in Canada. To help the coop students understand these hydrology data and digital representation it is proposed that the students assist Hal Ward in the GEOM20 digitizing labs (Winter Term) where these data will be created.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> There are two primary elements to this project. The first is to work with the provided GEOM20 student hydrology digitizing results toDevelop some Quality Control scripts to error trap and flag topological digitizing errors (Bryce Matthews at the MNR has some tools (WRIP Toolbox) which could serve as a good source of ideas). Develop some Quality Control scripts to test and where appropriate repair hydrology network integrity (Bryce Matthews at the MNR has some tools (WRIP Toolbox) which could serve as a good source of ideas). Develop a small laboratory (consistent with the depth and format of provided 2009 digitizing labs) in order to teach hydrology network requirements to an undergraduate class. Identify and document common student digitizing errors. Provide digitizing recommendations directly in existing labs.Optional - To aid communication explore integrating these vector space products in a Google-Earth environment.A second focus of this project is to explore the potential of integrating these automated vector space hydrology data products with remotely sensed derived elevation data products in order to develop fully integrated watershed geospatial data layers.For the student digitized watershed utilizing the Digitized developed hydrology data layers (point line and polygons) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 3 arc-second elevation data the ASTER 1 arc-second elevation dataconstruct two full ArcHydro databases (one for each elevation data source) including terrain derivates and catchments for a digitized watersheds. (Links to data sources provided below).Spatially and statistically compare the DEMs acquired from the NASA-JPL ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Global Elevation dataset with the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data.

<b>Project Name:</b> Evaluation of range expansion of Virginia Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) in Ontario in response to climate change and potential impact on the livestock industry.<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> In the first half of the 1900s opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were rarely found anywhere in Ontario. The few records for this species were from the southwestern portion of the province. More recently there has been some evidence that the species is undergoing a range expansion in Ontario probably as a result of milder winters. Opossums remain active all winter but are stressed by low temperatures. It is believed that severity of winter climate sets a limit on the species northern distribution. Opossums will take over the burrows of other animals or build dens in brushpiles hollow logs or tree cavities. They eat a wide range of plant material as well as insects small mammals the young of medium-sized mammals amphibiansIt is not known exactly what effect a range expansion of this species would have on other wildlife species and on ecosystems in Ontario however it is likely that they would act as predators on many species and compete with others for food or den sites. Opossums can be trapped and their pelts sold by licensed trappers in the province however the pelts are of relatively low value so an increase in the population would be unlikely to have a large positive impact on Ontarios economy. Of more concern is a potential negative impact on the livestock industry. Opossums are the definitive host for the parasite Sarcocystis neurona. This protozoan can cause equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) a serious neurological disease in horses. As opossums extend their range across agricultural lands the potential for spread of this disease greatly increases. Gaining an understanding of the range expansion of opossums in the province is the first step in assessing these climate-change-associated risks to Ontarios natural ecosystems and livestock industry and in developing appropriate adaptation strategies. This research will examine existing Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) data sources to evaluate temporal and spatial opossum distribution changes. The temporally and spatially corresponding weather variables will be assessed to determine if there are correlations with opossum range expansions. This project has the following objectives:By extracting information from existing OMNR databases including the furbearer management information system (FURMIS) and the rabies trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) database determine known opossum occurrences in Ontario over the years for which records are available. Students will need to identify requirements for standardization between years establish a procedure for standardizing the data and complete the required programming. The data from the rabies TVR program will need to be standardized across years and in a format suitable for consolidation with records from FURMIS.Based on the above information which contains township or coordinate information about opossum capture locations develop spatial representations of opossum distributions in Ontario in GIS showing changes over the years. It may be necessary to adjust some of the records to reflect boundary changes over time (for example if location information is given using a township the township boundaries may have changed over the years).Calculate average annual rate and direction of range expansion or contraction for opossums.Extract relevant winter weather information from federal climate databases for the years for which opossum data are available (e.g. mean and minimum temperatures for the months of November to March number of consecutive days with temperatures below a pre-determined minimum etc.)Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF) staff will be checking available databases to see if information on EPM occurrence in horses in Ontario can be extracted. If EPM data is available in a suitable format develop spatial representations of EPM occurrence in horses over the years for which data are available and analyze it for correlations with opossum distributions.To complete the steps of this project students would be required to massage existing datasets into spatial databases that can be analyzed together in an ESRI environment. Relevant opossum distribution data climate data and EPM occurrence data should be charted and graphed in a format that can be easily added to scientific journals technical reports and publications.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Industry Toolbox for ArcGIS Desktop<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> This project is to create a packaged set of resources for ArcGIS Desktop that is tailored to specific application areas of verticals. To get some idea of a similar project look at the collection of template data models for specific verticals markets on the support site:http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.dataModels.gatewayThese have been put together by people from industry and academia. They are an attempt to standardized database models - standardize GIS content - for specific areas. ESRI simple hosts and publishes the models and we promote them for our user community.ESRI Canada would like to see a similar idea for the Geoprocessing Framework for ArcGIS desktop. A collection of GP tools scripts and models that provide basic or common tasks for different GIS application areas. For example a collection of Geoprocessing tools for forestry for agriculture for public works. This could be applied to any number of industries.;Downloadable package of Geoprocessing Models scripts and documentation. The Models and tools will need to work with the Geoprocessing framework and be documented with help information (this is part of the Geoprocessing Framework no special help system compiler is needed).The workflows will need to be researched. In other words students should expect to interview a number of clients and industry experts to come up with required models and workflows. ESRI Canada will arrange the contacts.Optionally the GP models could be used in both ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Server. An additional deliverable could be simple web applications using the same tools via the task framework in the web ADF for ArcGIS Server 9.2<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Aboriginal Involvement and Referral Program<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Aboriginal Involvement and Referral Program helps to bring Aboriginal Communities of the Alberta Foothills together with Industry representatives in the hopes of protecting Aboriginal Communities Traditional Use Sites from disturbance during industry development on the landscape. One important step in the success of this program is the Referral Process a GIS enabled process that encompasses everything from the processing of raw GPS data collected by Aboriginal Communities to the generation of database reports and maps for distribution to both industry representatives and Aboriginal Community members. The goal of the project is to automate and possibly web-enable portions of the Referral Process. Tasks may include processing of raw GPS data building of user friendly data entry forms in MS Access joining of spatial and non-spatial data automating the spatial analysis component of the process web-enabling data entry and the industry request process automating the generation of maps and reports and reviewing and potentially updating the design of both a spatial and non-spatial database.The simplest way to describe the referral process is to say that the Foothills Model Forest (FtMF) takes GPS data from Aboriginal Communities and compares it to legal locations provided to the FtMF by industry representatives. The FtMF then generates reports and maps based on the results of the comparison and provides these to both Aboriginal Community members and industry representatives so that they may communicate more effectively and avoid potential conflicts.The Aboriginal Involvement and Referral process with which the students will become associated through this co-op project is a nation leading initiative which has documented the highest density of traditional use sites in Canada. The referral process is also the leading mitigation protocol having already protected over 90 traditional use sites from disturbance. ;Updated potentially re-designed Personal GeodatabaseUpdated potentially re-designed non-spatial databaseApplication/code that automates the spatial analysis portion of the Referral ProcessApplication/code that automates the report generation portion of the Referral ProcessApplication/code that automates the report map generation portion of the Referral ProcessApplication/code that allows for data entry and industry requests via the web<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> On-Line Tool for Whos Your City?<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Richard Floridas latest book which is scheduled for release in March 2008 is titled Whos Your City? The book is about theimportance of place but also discusses how people can go about selecting the place that they will live. I have attached a draft copy ofthe final chapter of the book and its associated graphics. We will have developed by the time the book is released a fairly genericwebsite that will allow people to specify their own unique criteria and weightings of various factors in order to see a list of their owntop places. For an example that we helped to develop see http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/bestcities/We would like to develop a map-based much more interactive version of the tool. What we really want is something that wouldallow people to change their priorities or answers to the questions and then simultaneously see the results being updated on a map. Itwould be ideal if they could also specify different types of visual displays just numbered or colored or different sized push pins forthe top 10 top 25 top 50; a heat map version which would show more the general regions that offered the best fit; a version thatwould hide or shade parts of the country that dont meet their criteria; other cool ideas would be most welcome. The idea is to havean interactive way for people to specify their own unique criteria see what place is best for them and also gain an understanding ofthe what-ifs and the trade-off relationships among the various criteria. For example what happens if Im not as concerned aboutcrime? or schools? or what if cost isnt a factor? What happens if I say I would be happy to live anywhere and not just on the eastcoast? those kinds of things.We would be able to provide all the raw data. It would need to be organized into an accessible on-line database and the webapplication developed.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Analysis of shoreline and waterfowl breeding activity<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Land Between (TLB) is a transition zone extending east to west from southern Georgian Bay to near Kingston and between southern Ontario and the Canadian Shield. It is a mosaic ecotone of exposed limestone and granite bedrock interspersed with small pocket aquatic resources and has a distinct complement of human cultural features and wildlife communities. The Land Between is situated between ecoregions (Shield and Lowlands) and also between OMNR and Conservation Authority jurisdictions resulting in limited knowledge or data to characterize the values and functions of this area. Furthermore a true boundary for the ecotone has not been verified. The area remains relatively in tact compared to ecosystems in southern Ontario however development and resource extraction are rapidly increasing making the need for meaningful resource based planning essential. In addition to the limited data restricting the execution of meaningful and strategic landscape-scale planning the use of planning tools such as the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is constrained due to the numerous and uncharted small interconnected wetlands.It is presumed that there are small and interconnected aquatic resources across this area whereas areas to the north contain larger homogeneous lowlands and contained and contiguous waters distinguishable from one another characterize those to the south.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Experience has shown that in the Land Between the digitization of aerial photos and so estimation of wetland pockets will highlight approximately 80% more wetlands than are recognized by current data sets. This new data will allow for appropriate planning at meaningful scales.It is also surmised that The Land Between and its extent may be characterized by a markedly high shoreline length relative to area compared to those ecoregions to the north and south. Once aquatic resources are digitized and a more comprehensive water-polygon data set exists for the area (newly digitized wetlands plus those already contained in NRVIS) calculating shoreline to area percentages within the ecotone and relating this percentage to areas outside the area will help to define and bound the Land Between.Lastly as aquatic resources are pocketed and abundant the Land Between is known to harbor extensive waterfowl habitat. Nesting of waterfowl is dependant on the amount of open water within a wetland and secondly will occur only if privacy (cover) is available so that pocketed or small and deep wetlands as those found in the Land Between are ideal. As water levels fluctuate so then does the nesting activity and success of waterfowl. Changes in breeding activity may then be tracked and correlated to changes in climate and condition.Ducks Unlimited Canada has long-term nest box monitoring programs in various townships and will provide along with air photo mosaics for digitization nesting data related to key wetland sites. An estimation of current and potential breeding activity will be calculated from this data and by quantifying the availability of suitable aquatic resources. In order to facilitate improved and meaningful landscape and program planning a digital layer will be created using air photo mosaics provided and key attributes (provided as well) including wetland number and those associated with nesting activity will be tagged. The students will then conduct a spatial analysis of the shoreline relative to area for each township and contrast these to one township to the south and north of the Land Between ecotone. Analysis will be enabled through the use of waterlines/water polygons from the newly digitized resources and those provided through a data sharing agreement with OMNR for NRVIS data. Lastly waterfowl breeding activity will be analyzed using the nesting attributes/data from the Ducks Unlimited<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Solar PV Community Power Project- Land classification and assessment<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Evergreen Power Solutions is interested in developing a Solar PV Community Power Project which will generate renewable electricity to be sold into the public distribution grid as useable electricity. This power plant will use photovoltaic (PV) solar cells which collect the energy from the Suns rays and convert it into electricity. Once installed solar PV is CO2 emission free. The estimated size of the project produced by Evergreen Power Solutions would be 1-10MW which will occupy anywhere from 10to 100acres of Land. The land required to build this project will need to be in close proximity to a sub-station and transmission lines with the capacity required to properly transfer all generated electricity back to the grid. Evergreen Power Solutions seeks to organize a GIS project that will display potential land suitable for a Solar PV Community Power Project. Land for such a project must contain a zoning classification of 4 or higher and will ideally be owned by the City of Kawartha Lakes. The surface of the selected area will need to be relativity level to support Solar PV Panels and to decrease potential shading thus the calculations of both slope and aspect will need to be considered.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database design/Processing- spatial/Statistical analysis- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Apply the criteria to maps using the best available information and technologies. Land that fits all criteria of a solar farm: Size 50 acres +/extent Land development/zoning/ownership Slope/aspectSignificant Substations/ transmission lines All sub-stations in and surrounding the selected land. Three phase transmission lines within and near the property.Site Comparisons: Suitability analysis to determine a ranking system for the three selected sites to establish the most fitting location for a large scale Solar PV Community Power Project.Project deliverables can be developed by first using zoning and classification data owned by the city of Kawartha Lakes which Evergreen Power Solutions have full access to. This data will help distinguish three parcels of land within a 40 by 60 kilometer area that can be used to build a solar PV community project. These parcels of land should be 50 acres or greater with a land classification of 4 or higher within a specified area established by Evergreen Power Solutions. After three locations have been chosen slope and aspect will be calculated using DEM photos provided by Fleming College. Data regarding substations and transmission lines surrounding the three sites will be provided by Evergreen Power Solutions. After all aspects of the project have been completed a site comparison between the three locations will be conducted by the students showing the positive and negative attributes of each site.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Haliburton Highlands Soil Mapping _ Capacity for Agriculture<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Land Between is a region bordering the Algonquin Dome and which marks the transition between the arable lands of the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the forests of the Canadian Shield. This region spanning from Georgian Bay to the Frontenac arch is an ecotone and as such boasts some of the highest diversity in Ontario. Too unique characteristics include limestone and granite barrens; predominately shallow soils (estimated at less than 15cm deep on average); while interconnected rivers small lakes and wetlands contribute to the highest percentage of shoreline to area than anywhere else in Ontario. This lack of buffering capacity and rapid drainage makes the region highly susceptible to contamination and slow to recover from disturbance. In addition the region displays small and dispersed communities whose economic bases are mostly reliant on tourism and seasonal cottaging. Little to no industrial sector is present. The goals of The Land Between include enhancing the economic and natural amenities of the region. An increased focus and demand for viable agriculture in the region is becoming apparent in Official Plans as well as desire expressed by landowners which in turn will support sustainable and meaningful economic development. Farms at Work is a program focused on the research preservation and enhancement of working farmlands in Central Ontario. The program also focuses on best practices and stewardship of both farms and farming heritage/practices. It is well understood that farming contributes greatly to the economic diversity and development within a region and especially during climate change a locally accessible and viable farming sector provides for those essential goods and services also providing a buffer or resistance to current recessive economic traits. The abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem determine the vegetative communities and land uses that are available. The understanding of soils specifically provides a baseline of information leading to an understanding of forest type and cover wetland locations buffering capacity and vulnerability of landscapes as well as potential for agriculture.The Haliburton Highlands is central in The Land Between and is a focus area or pilot area to for Farms at Work. Furthermore of all the counties across the region Haliburton has the least economic diversity and farming activities. Surprisingly Haliburton is the only County across the region that has no surficial deposit mapping/mapping of soils.Therefore this project is the first step in delineating researching enhancing and integrating key baseline data for many aspects of planning stewardship and development in the highlands. Arable lands will be delineated and then may be prioritized to introduce manage and steward farming within the county. However the utility of the data and results are meaningful extending beyond this sector; affording advanced research and management of all natural features including the ability to remotely delineate habitats vegetative communities hazard zones. In turn the ability to prioritize stewardship and monitoring efforts will be available. It will provide the first available source of data that is much needed and may be utilized and refined by partners such as Agriculture Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs. Soils will also affect landscape planning by increasing the ability to assign set back requirements and buffer zones for development.The project will involve digitizing the only comprehensive hard-copy inventories of soils for the area: the Aggregate Resources Inventory Reports (ARIP) referenced to natural resource and municipal data provided. A database and attribute table will be created to link and assign soil type and depth to the georeferenced layers. The data will then be queried to highlight potential and best choices for arable lands by looking at soil depth and type; access hazard areas and access to water. If time permits site reconnaissance/surveys will be done in key area to test and ground-truth results. If time is not available truthing may be done using vegetative community/forest stands (FRI data).An assessment comparing the average depth of soils in Haliburton will be conducted and if time permits an analysis comparing those depths of soils to soils immediately south of The Land Between/St. Lawrence Lowlands (provided by OMAF surficial geology data). Results will then be captured in a final mapped product and made available to the partners and placed within one-page dedicated Farms at Work website and will be made available on The Land Between website. ;Georeferenced shapefile(s) containing surficial deposits/soils for Haliburton County (and if needed separated by township)A database and attribute table containing polygon ID#; soil type and soil depthA query and resulting map of arable lands and potential farmlands within Haliburton CountyVerification involving ground truthing (site visits) or comparing with vegetative community/forest stands (FRI data)Analysis/results providing the average depth of soil in areas containing deposits for Haliburton and if time permits comparing soil depth in Haliburton to those immediately south of the Land Between within the St. Lawrence LowlandsA one-page content on the Farms at Work websiteA final report with process and findings and including database query methods;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Presentation/Visualization<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Comparative Analysis of Far North Disturbance Mapping<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Satellite based mapping can provide a timely and efficient means of identifying natural disturbance. Of particular interest is to reliably map fire events across Ontario's Far North. Current efforts include disturbance mapping using a 3 date time series approach based on Landsat data. A complementary approach is to use coarser resolution imagery known as MODIS to uncover fire disturbance events. The similarities and differences between these 2 approaches are unknown. The objective is to perform qualitative and quantitative comparison of the 2 mapping approaches for selected portion of the Far North. A secondary objective is to compare the findings to aerial survey data for the same area.

<b>Project Name:</b> Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan Mobile GIS<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan is Canadas national radiological and nuclear (RN) emergency preparedness and response plan administered and led by Health Canada. The plan provides the federal operational framework for the multi-departmental response to an RN emergency affecting Canada or Canadians abroad. Over 20 federal departments and agencies have specific responsibilities listed in the plan. The FNEP also supports the provincial response to an RN emergency provides the framework for radiological consequence management in support of Canadas National Counter-terrorism Plan and links to the Canada-United States Joint Radiological Emergency Response Plan and international arrangements and obligations such as the IAEA Conventions on Early Notification and Assistance. The Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response Division (NEPRD) of Health Canadas Radiation Protection Bureau coordinates the plan. During an RN incident NEPRD uses models complemented with field measurements to evaluate the impact of the incident on the ground on humans and the environment. For this reason NEPRD would like to develop an ArcGIS mobile application that would allow transfer of data collected in the field to a central database. This data would then be automatically mapped into a web GIS application and made available to the people in the field. The same application would also be used in the planning of exercises. In this case data would be created in the database prior to the exercise and automatically displayed in the field while exercise participants would be simulating data collection in the field based on pre-recorded coordinates.This project will involve researching on the best way to fulfill this requirement. Whereas the software to be used in this project is ArcGIS mobile NEPRD would like to know which hardware would be best suited to its needs (e.g. notebooks PDAs cells phones etc.).<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Focal Area Conservation Strategies<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Land Between is a large transitional landscape that lies between the Algonquin Dome/Canadian Shield and the St. Lawrence Lowlands. It is what ecologists call an ecotone. It has a distinct ecological structure and unique cultural history. Due to its mosaic patterning and transitional nature it has been primarily overlooked by ministries and conservation agencies. Therefore much of the ecological and cultural nature of the area are yet to be uncovered understood and communicated.The Land Between consists of 90% lands in natural cover; a greater amount than anywhere to the south. However the region is experiencing rapid development and is under increasing threat to disturbance. Public and Crown Lands are found across the landscape forming large undisturbed tracts within The Land Between. Between these protected areas are lands that are important and form natural linkages across the region and so may play a role in maintaining essential ecological services. Up to 5 focal areas have been outlined which contribute to the formation of key linkages or which provide undisturbed and protected refuge for species at risk and other ecological elements.These focal areas include: 1. Severn River Crown Lands2. North Ramara3. Longford Township/Queen Elizabeth Park 24. Kawartha Highlands Signature Site Provincial Park5. Mellon Lake/Lingam Lake6. Crowe River Upper Watershed Each area requires a conservation strategy or prioritization model to be applied:a. Gathering mapping and modeling data on ecological elements such as SAR (species at risk) FRI (forest resource inventories) physiography wetlands and waterbodies roads etc. from a variety of sources and from our data sharing agreements will lay the foundation and provide the basis for areas of significance within each focal area.b. Further information such as ownership (parcel fabric) disturbance (roads trails aggregate pits etc.) will provide information on which areas are more at risk and so which lands within the focal areas are a priority to target for outreach stewardship or securement. c. Lastly a landowner contact database based on the prioritization scheme and stakeholder listing will provide us with a starting point for action.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Historical Place Names Database and Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Land Between is a large transitional landscape that lies between the Algonquin Dome/Canadian Shield and the St. Lawrence Lowlands. It is what ecologists call an ecotone. It has a distinct ecological structure and unique cultural history. Due to its mosaic patterning and transitional nature it has been primarily overlooked by ministries and conservation agencies. Therefore much of the ecological and cultural nature of the area are yet to be uncovered understood and communicated.The natural features of the region has provided for a unique resource based and cultural history. For instance a historic and important First Nations fishing economy based on the presence and abundance of the American Eel was the basis for much activity in the landscape prior to the installation of dams across the Trent Severn Waterway and so the extirpation of the Eel. Also as the land was not conducive to farming or lumbering there have been attempts and so a rise and fall of European settlement which has given way to ghost towns across the landscape. Furthermore the density of water pockets/shorelines to area within the region are higher than anywhere in Ontario also the landscape has many open and exposed areas of bedrock so that boating/canoeing and overland trails were the means to navigating the land and the area was a key east-west corridor for First Nations peoples.In order to highlight and so conserve significant cultural and natural features of The Land Between we believe that the history of the place plays an important role: researching history brings to light stories which lend to an appreciation understanding and so responsibility for the land. As well much information can simply be gleaned from the names of a Place. For instance the American Eel historically played a large role in the lives of First Nations and first settlers; many lakes rivers and former towns/settlements carry names denoting the presence of the species or related associations. Other First Nations and historical names contain links to other stories peoples settlers or events.The Ministry of Natural Resources maintains archives and hard copy records of historic place names new names and the reason behind the original naming (where available) as well as the reasons for the name change. The MNR has just begun the process to build a database to house this information and the students would be involved in creating a compatible database for The Land Between using similar standards. The students would also populate the database through research within a specific area or around a specific theme. Students will locate and georeference Historical Places and Names and their meanings which will create a picture of both the cultural and natural history of the area and so will further the capacity for outreach and conservation.;Data and mapping for current place names in workable format (therefore linking of MNR geospatial data with dbf data)A database and front end program that would allow someone to query new and historic place names as well as rationales for each name and rationals for name changes. The database must be compatible (have the same key and standards) with that basic program created by the MNR.Population of Historic Place names (data) within the database in a chosen area in The Land Between (i.e. North Peterborough) or from a chosen theme (i.e. fish/First Nations)A map of the current and historic place names within the chosen area of focus (and if First Nations focus then include meanings)A basic instruction guide for the database for future populationSpatial Analysis linking and highlighting or relating presence of natural features/natural resources to place names is possible;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Methodology for DEM creation and Analysis of bog hydrology<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Wainfleet Bog is approximately 18 sq km and is located near the City of Port Colborne. This bog is part of the largest least disturbed peatland in Southern Ontario. As a result of expanding agricultural peat extraction and transportation activities within and around the Wainfleet Bog the bog wetland has decreased in size and function. Measures to remediate/slow the factors degrading this ecosystem are critical to improving the environment. Ground water levels vegetation changes and sensitive animal populations have been monitored at selected locations within the bog over several years. Moisture levels and flooding are important factors influencing the survival of Massassauga Rattlesnake and Spotted turtles within the bog. Massassauga Rattlesnakes Spotted turtles and sphagnum moss differ in their ability to tolerate flooding. Accurate modelling of water levels is necessary to predict areas suitable for planting sphagnum rattlesnake hibernation and turtle habitat.;1.

<b>Project Name:</b> Weather and Agrometeorological Web Mapping Application<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Many land soil and water management activities are directly dependent on the immediate past and immediate future weather. Currently weather forecasts can be obtained independently from the Environment Canadas Weather Office and other organizations offering weather forecasting. The ultimate goal of this project is to enable a user to analyse the impacts that weather parameters may have on crops soil and water management activities.The cooperative project team is asked to create a prototype of a web-based analytical and interactive mapping application encompassing weather and agrometeorological forecasts and land soil and water information.Weather data will be downloaded from the Weather Office web site whereas agrometeorological indicators will be derived from the downloaded weather data. The data provided by the Weather Office is in GRIB (Gridded Binary). The first functionality of this project is to download the GRIB data and convert it in a GIS-enabled format (e.g. shapefile). This functionality should be automated so that every say 4:00 A.M. the data will be downloaded and converted into the GIS format.For this prototype the following weather layers should be created:- Precipitation o 24-hours precipitation amount (mm)o 24-hours probability of precipitation &gt;= 2 mmo 48-hours precipitation amount (mm)o 48-hours probability of precipitation &gt;= 2 mmo 7-day probability of precipitation &gt;= 5 mmo 14-day probability of precipitation &gt;= 10 mm- Temperatureo 24-hours Average minimum temperatureo 24-hours Average maximum temperatureo 24-hours Average temperatureo 48-hours Average temperatureo 7-day average temperatureo 14-day average temperature- Windo 24-hours forecasto 48-hours forecasto 24-hours wind gustso 48-hours wind gustsFor the 24 and 48 hours the deterministic regional GEM (global environmental multiscale) model data will be used (15 km resolution); for the 7 days and 14 days the ensemble forecasts data will be used (110 km resolution).Layers to be created for agrometeorological indicators are as follows:o Cumulative growing degree days &gt;= 5 ├é┬░Co Cumulative crop heat unitso Drying indexo Cumulative potential evapotranspirationo Cumulative actual evapotranspirationo Moisture deficit (precipitation potential evapotranspiration)For each parameter a layer will be created for 24 hours 48 hours 7 days 14 days (where applicable).Students are required to research on how the above parameters are determined.The newly created layer will then be added to a web map already containing land soil and water related layers. The second required functionality of this project is data querying. The application should allow attribute and spatial data querying and provide a possibility of saving the results of the queries (as tables or spatial features).If time permits the third functionality required of this project is data geoprocessing where such functions as polygon boundary dissolving layer intersecting layer spatial joining and layer clipping would be provided.;The main deliverable from this project is a fully functional interactive web mapping application integrating weather and agrometeorological forecasts and other land soil and water information. Details of how to transfer the developed website to the client server should be provided.Secondarily this project should also develop and document the methodology used to integrate weather and agrometeorological information in an operational application tailored to a sector of activity namely agricultural land soil and water resources management. So a detailed report to this effect should be submitted at the conclusion of this project.;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Web TechnologyThe ideal group for this project should be composed of 3 students who are good in programming.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Archaeological Potential Tool<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The objective of this project is to develop an archaeological potential mapping tool for the Ministry of Culture (MCL). Archaeological potential is the likelihood of a piece of land to contain archaeological resources. The MCL has developed criteria (distance to water elevated pieces of land etc.) that are used to predict which lands would potentially hold previously unreported archaeological sites. Within the Ministry staff use these criteria to make potential call determinations for environmental assessments and other types of projects.<br>

<b>Deliverables:</b> The expected deliverable for this project is an archaeological potential map service allowing staff to see archaeological potential which is based on the potential criteria (see Appendix A). To reach this goal the necessary spatial datasets (DEMs geological base data etc.) will need to be acquired normalized and integrated. A component of this project will be to use spatial analysis using surveyed property information and reported site data. It will be necessary to change the database structure to track this information. The students will be expected to give a final presentation on the application to the MCL.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Spatially-explicit Decision Support System for Modelling Soil Carbon emissions and sinks in rural landscapes<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Through work with the Food and Agricuture Organization of the United Nations and the Geomatics Lab at Trent University a Modelling Decision Support System (Soil-CV) has been partially developed to aid users selecting the best of 3 possible Soil Organic Matter and Soil Carbon dynamics models to be used in projects formulating land use plans for mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG)and climate change in a region or district in the developing world within the context of the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Capabilities for spatially-explicit display and mapping of modelling results are only available for one of such models within the Decision Support System. This project should tackle the development of a customized interface to allow for mapping display and reporting of modelling results for the models without mapping capabilities. The goals for the project are as follows: 1. Update the Decision Support System (DSS) at the point of selection of the CENTURY and RothC models: To update the existing DSS for the two currently implemented models and add support for the two models SCUAF and DNDC that are to be integrated. 2. GUI: To create a GUI for the two models that are being implemented and integrate them with the current Soil-CV application. 3. Interfacing GUI with Models: To facilitate communication between models and the front end GUI. 4. Output Management: To allow users to organize store and view the output from modeling results that are generated by the models. 5. ArcGIS Interface: the goal here is to interface with the ArcGIS application as an extension of output management and to allow the user to take the output and generate maps graphs and tables using ArcGIS.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Protected Areas System Expansion through GIS Analysis<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Ontarios protected area system is comprised of more than 620 provincial parks and conservation reserves. Protected areas contribute to the Ontario economy and the protection of Ontarios biodiversity. One of the goals of the parks and protected areas program is to represent the province's natural features and ecosystems. Both living and non-living components are assessed to set representation targets based on combinations of landforms and vegetation. MNR's approach to representing terrestrial ecosystems is based on these naturally occurring landform/vegetation associations which serve as surrogates for biodiversity. Life Science (or biodiversity) representation is assessed within each of Ontario's 71 ecodistricts. MNR's minimum guidelines are to represent at least 1% or 50 hectares of each naturally occurring landform/vegetation association within each ecodistrict.Based on this approach Ontario Parks designed the GapTool application to help obtain and organize information about ecological representation including determining where gaps in representation occur. Ontario Parks Southwest Zone has initiated work on a land securement strategy to identify and prioritize properties for acquisition as either additions to existing provincial parks or as stand alone new provincial parks. Key to this project is utilizing GapTool outputs to assess current representation levels within the Southwest Zone which includes 13 ecodistricts. Through GIS analysis it is envisioned that a number of Zone specific criteria in addition to landform/vegetation associations can be applied to identify potential acquisitions. A weighting system could then be applied based on these criteria to prioritize identified properties.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Ministry of the Environment - Dorset Environmental Science Center Hydrologic Cathment Topographic/Delineation Mapping Co-op Project<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Background Information:Our focus is monitoring long-term changes in water quality quantity and the biological communities of inland lakes and streams. The Dorset Environmental Science Centre (DESC) of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment began its scientific activities in 1975 with the monitoring of area hydrology meteorology nutrient chemistry algae and zooplankton. Bio-monitoring activities have expanded since to include both benthos and crayfish. The centre has grown in size and scope and investigates a wide variety of issues in partnership with a number of universities municipalities and other governmental and non-governmental organizations. The study area is comprised of a collection of lake basins located in south-central Ontario on the edge of the Precambrian shield Long-term monitoring conducted within the DESC monitoring network is intended to improve our fundamental understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of environmental processes of this region. It provides the baseline data necessary to evaluate changes in response to natural perturbations and anthropogenic disturbance. It proves invaluable when combined with experimental studies designed to explain how different elements of the environment interact with one another. Continued operation of long-term monitoring efforts within the network further provides valuable data for assessments and models on the cumulative effects of environmental stressors in the environment at the local and regional scales.The current study encompasses eight headwater lakes (over 20 catchments) in the Muskoka/Haliburton region. The lakes range from highly developed shoreline to zero development for comparative analysis of anthropogenic effects on Precambrian Shield lakes. These studies have yielded numerous papers and environmental models used in other studies in this field Project Purpose:To create both digital &amp; hard copy topographic mapping with 1m accuracy for detailed delineation of the catchment area. This data will be used in the calculation of hydrologic inputs of the lake system (precipitation) as well as the hydrologic storage and interflow throughout the catchment. The data will also be used for comparison to existing lidar &amp; GPS data files to assess the accuracy of these files and processes of data collection involved to determine the need for similar studies on other catchments within the current study area;Requirements:This project will require the collection of field data of an approximate 26 ha catchment of crown land for comparison to existing lidar &amp; depth to bedrock data files. Field work will be performed with GPS or Total station and would require walking and capturing data along physical characteristics (all hills/valleys/streams/wetlands etc.) within that catchment area. The accuracy of these methods will be reviewed and if deemed insufficient a unit with differential capabilities supplied.The aim is the production of a digital map displaying the relationship between the topographic structure of the land area the underlying bedrock and the vegetative canopy. The digital map should include an expandable attribute table for integration of past and future data for various comparative studies. The production of a hardcopy map for presentation to the local scientific community and display in the Hydrology Department facility will be a further requirement of the project.The design and development of a database for the storage of Hydro-Meteorological &amp; Biochemistry data will be a major component of the project. There is a possibility the project will require customized programming and Web compatibility for posting the projects data to the Ministry Webpage with the addition of similar information from subsequent co-op projects ;- Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization- Web TechnologyFleming faculty assessment of the students abilties to complete the project.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Local Carbon-Offset Decision Support System<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Climate change is a local and global issue. Individuals businesses and governments through their day to day activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions that are responsible for climate change. Kawartha Heritage Conservancy (KHC) a land trust would like to explore the possibility of using its lands as a means for offsetting carbon by leveraging the various ecological services provided through its lands. Of the many ecological services available planting trees is one means of sequestering carbon. It is however necessary to quantify how much carbon can be sequestered by a particular species of tree or shrub over a period of time in order to be able to sell carbon-offset credits. KHC believes a GIS and Modelling Decision Support System would be a useful tool for identifying areas within our property that can be used for afforestation purposes selecting suitable native vegetation types in the Kawarthas to help offset carbon and to calculate how much carbon would be offset by a particular plant species.The decision support system has the following objectives:Using spatial analysis/remote sensing identify areas on KHC properties that would be conducive for reforestation and vegetation purposes.Identify areas on our properties that are clear of vegetation and could serve as potential clean energy project location (e.g. south facing area that might be conducive for solar energy projects).Develop a carbon offset calculator that allows KHC or other users to calculate the carbon sequestering potential for several vegetation types within the region.Assign an estimated monetary value for the ecosystem service provided by the vegetation type.Calculate the relationship between a potential CO2 source (e.g. litres of fuel consumed/year; energy consumed/year; etc) and the sequestration potentialIt may be necessary to identify data sources and convert this data into a format accessible by the GIS.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Operationalizing the Production of National Watershed Mapping for Sierra Leone<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The significance of Land Use Planning in a watershed context is increasingly recognized and implemented in jurisdictions around the world. Many of the food security and environmental challenges facing Sierra Leone such as agricultural optimization (particularly wetland agriculture) seasonal flooding soil erosion and soil depletion could in-part be addressed through Land Use Planning with access to well structured GIS watershed layers. Sierra Leone currently has very little structured GIS data and no watershed mapping. They do however have very rich legacy hard-copy 1:50000 scale photogrammetrically derived topographic mapping. The hydrology features depicted on this mapping such as rivers steams swamps (points) swamp outlines (polygons) swamp cultivation (points) and rapids represent durable landscape features that could be productively utilized if captured and made widely accessible as structured GIS layers. It is believed these data could be additionally combined with satellite derived elevation data products (ASTER and SRTM) to produce authoritative watershed layers suitable to support effective and scale appropriate Land Use Planning across the country. An investment in the structured automation of these data would bring Sierra Leones digital GIS watershed fabric comparable to products we are operationally utilizing in Ontario Canada and indeed many North American jurisdictions. In 2009 a Fleming Application Specialist groups (comprised of Brent Moore Jocelyn Moffett and Justin MacTavish) successfully develop a series of training materials (including laboratory exercises manuals data models GeoDatabases on-screen voice-over instruction tutorials etc) to help standardize and coordinate hydrology feature (line point and polygon) automation from existing 1:50000 scale scanned Sierra Leonean topographic maps (all materials to be provided). Building directly on the 2009 effort in 2010 a second Fleming Application Specialist groups (Ian Jeffery Alex Parisien and Scott Charbonneau) worked directly with the GIS undergraduate 2010 Fleming Geomatics Technician Program students to test implement the developed hydrology digitizing procedures. Under the guidance of course instructor Hal Ward each student (approximately 30 students) was tasked will digitally capturing the hydrology features for a manageable sub-watershed (approximately three hours of digitizing). This digitizing effort was part a major project for credit within their GEOM20 Course (GIS Applications). Based on this test-run the 2010 GIS-AS group further refined the digitizing procedures/manuals and built a series of operational QA/QC hydrology network and digitizing error trapping modules suitable for the students to test the quality of their own digitizing. This group also developed a community based project web-site and evaluated the potential of ASTER and SRTM (see references below) as potential elevation source for a watershed information system. The results of this 2010 project (refined manuals tutorials hydrology data models project web-site elevation data comparisons and analysis) are being sent to Sierra Leone for operational national implementation at Fourah Bay College Freetown (http://fbcusl.net/). It is hoped that hydrology digitizing in Sierra Leone could be started as early as January 2011. The project tasks described below will directly build on the successes of the 2009 and 2010 efforts.;The project primary objectives for this year are four fold. Work with student digitizing efforts contributed from both Fourah Bay College and Fleming College.might also be helpful for each member of the coop group to each digitize a watershed using the provided standards manuals and GeoDatabase. I did a watershed myself and found it represents about a 3 hour effort. Digitizing will once again be conducted within GIS Applications GMT course (GEOM20) this winter term. In common with the 2010 project it would be advantageous to have the student group work with the instructor in the lab environment as this digitizing is occurring to get a full sense of the data and digitizing challenges. The digitizing results once completed should evaluated and integrated into the completed data class.Hopefully (but this is not a certainty) we will receive some first digitizing results from Dr. Jinnah Momohs GIS lab at Fourah Bay College Freetown Sierra Leone. As with the Fleming digitizing works these results should be checked and some feedback provided back to Sierra Leone. The accepted results should be entered in the data class.Based on the results of the above it would be desirable to refine the digitizing manuals data model and QA/QC tools. (This is expected to be a minor portion of the project).Digitizing will be occurring on a subwatershed basis in two different countries and potentially with time at several different institutions. As this project becomes operational it becomes increasingly important to be able to track digitizing progress by subwatershed.Develop a database that will track subwatershed digitizing progress. Items that need to tracked will include National Watershed ID when assigned contact information for digitizer Institution of digitizer who assigned to date of first submission back from digitizer outstanding issues with digitizing date returned to digitizer final status when approved when uploaded into final data classWould like to keep this application in a readily available RDBMS (such as Access) for eventual implementation at Fourah Bay College.Develop a web-based watershed check-out system. Via a web interface a volunteer could be able to check-out a sub-watershed for digitizing. This system would be linked to the tracking database described in item 2 above. It is anticipated this system will be developed/tested this year and could possibly go live later in 2011. Over the web someone (anyone) could check-out a subwatershed for digitizing. From information the volunteer entered the project database described under item 2 would be auto-populated and the selected subwatershed would be locked for an identified period of time to this user. The user would receive a bundled package including instructions the developed manuals tutorials GeoDatabase XMLs QA/QC tools and the raw data. The user would also be made aware that this subwatershed has been locked under their name and will be provided with a date to return results (or communicate progress) by.Was a watershed has been the National status map will be updated to indicate this changeIn the project website developed by Alex Parisien in 2010 a location for this application has been accommodated.A fourth focus for this project will to develop detailed ISO 19115/FGDC/Dublin Core Spatial Metadata for the developed hydrology data and have these data published (this is a relatively small task).Install the UNs GeoNetwork Open Source Metadata tool at the college and generate appropriate and detailed ISO 19115 metadata. A small task but an important task. http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home Will assist in publishing resultant data and developed metadata to the UN-FAOs main spatial data warehouse (I still have administrator privileges). This will expose these data immediately to global community. For example see http://www.fao.org:80/geonetwork?uuid=67507cc0-f321-11db-9a22-000d939bc5d8Optional Time Permitting.

<b>Project Name:</b> Village of Sturgeon Point Interactive Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Village of Sturgeon Point has a rich history. People from Lindsay first came to Sturgeon Point in the 1830s a hotel was built in the 1870s and the first cottages in the 1880s followed by permanent residents. From 1899 to 1999 Sturgeon Point was the smallest incorporated village in Ontario. Our goal is to bring this history to life for residents students of local history and geography and casual browsers. We would like to produce both a printable hard copy and a web-based map of Sturgeon Point. The first step would be to update existing map files with new streets and an updated database of householder names. A paper copy of this map would be produced and distributed to villagers. The map files would then be used to create an interactive map on the SPA website. Our goal is to present a dynamic portrait of the village through the 180 years of its life. This web map would include photos of places and life in the village past and present accompanied by brief captions. Wed love to produce a map with multiple versions. One would be Current Points of Interest. Another would be Historic Street Views with the ability to layer the Historic Views by time period.;Printable map file with complete database of residents. Database should be updateable and linked to the map.Web-based map of the village that provides a framework to present photographs depicting the highlights of village activities. Selectable layers could filter the photographs or content by time period. (One concept might be described as an historic version of Google Street View. Icons on the map would indicate the location and point of view of a linked photo. Clicking on the icon brings up the photo with a short descriptive text.)An interface for site manager to update and enhance content for the web map. This would allow the map managers to add additional photos and content as they are contributed by the community. The map would then grow and evolve over time.An interface that facilitates user contributions.Links to and from the map with other web-based resources. For example a hyper-link in an independent document could open the map with an icon or overlay indicating a specific location that may be described in the text. This would add an extra dimension to historical texts original documents and photo archives that will be located on the web site.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Source Protection Threats Analysis: Certificate of Approval Relationships<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Clean Water Act 2006 was created to protect existing and future sources of drinking water within the Province of Ontario. The Act is based on collaboration and locally-driven source protection plans that are science-based. One requirement of Source Protection Committees is to submit an Assessment Report document that identifies significant drinking water quality and quantity threats within defined Source Protection Areas &amp; Regions. There is a need for an exercise to be completed to create relationships between the identified significant threats found in Assessment Reports and their proximity/relation to provincially prescribed instruments such as Certificate of Approval documents. Any facility that releases emissions to the atmosphere discharges contaminants to ground or surface water provides potable water supplies or stores transports or disposes of waste must have a Certificate of Approval before it can operate lawfully. Once relationships have been created analysis and reporting needs to be performed using GIS and a summary of the findings along with a cartographic output will be submitted back to the Ministrys Source Protection Programs Branch.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Presentation/Visualization<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> When the project is completed it is hopeful that the following outputs will be delivered:A geocoded dataset of Certificate of Approval data for a Source Protection Area/Region as decided upon by Source Protection Programs Branch staff (still to be determined. Will depend on data availability)A geodatabase that will develop relationships between the following datasets:Certificate of Approval datasetSource Protection Area/Region BoundariesMunicipal Drinking Water System dataSignificant Threats dataVulnerable Area dataA series of spatial/statistical analysis exercises using GIS software. Analysis will include overlays proximity analysis summaries etc.A high-end cartographic output of findings that can be used for presentations by Ministry staff.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Mapping Ontarios Headwater Areas<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The proposed project involves the creation of a series of products designed both to enhance the public understanding of Ontarios headwater areas as well as to establish a pilot GIS-based framework to incorporate some preliminary watershed and headwater data. This latter aspect of the project would be developed in a manner adhering to MNR protocols so that additional scientific data could be imported downstream by a variety of users.It is anticipated that the project would involve 2 to 4 students with participants from both the Cartographic and Application specialist streams. Project vision and guidance as needed for the student team would be provided by the Ontario Headwaters Institute (OHI) with datasets and limited technical direction provided by staff in MNR.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Programming/Customization- Presentation/Visualization- Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A team report summarizing an existing review of headwater literature (to be provided) varying definitions of headwaters or headwater drainage areas and existing MNR headwater related mapping projects which would provide both an agreed definition of headwaters for this project and a suggested way forward for item 3 below. A regional scale map of what the OHI terms Ontarios Major Upland Headwater Areas* or MUHAs based on protocols agreed upon in item 1. One intended purpose of this map is that of an iconic image for OHI public outreach.* While a headwater can occur anywhere in a watershed such as a first order stream flowing directly into a major body of water such as Lake Ontario the purpose of this project is to map important upland areas where large numbers of small streams exist converge and provide the foundation of Ontarios watercourses. In addition although MUHAs exist throughout the province this project would focus only on the southern regions including known MUHAs such as the Algonquin Dome the Oak Ridges Moraine the Dundalk Plateau and the Niagara Escarpment. A series of site-specific maps or drawings indicating the variety of headwater types and/or conditions across Ontarios landscape. It is hope that this project would be able to provide at least three of the drawings listed below:A pristine headwater area with intact 1st and 2nd order streams A forested headwater area that is less intact eg: a clear-cut managed forest with minimal stream protection managed forest with 30 m riparian edge etc A sample agricultural area with good practices regarding forest area retained wetland and/or intact riparian edge A best-practice community such as Waterloo that is keeping as many small streams as possible above ground andAn urban area that has put most small streams underground. A GIS-layered interactive map of southern Ontario watersheds and their MUHAs - scaled back to all or most of the Oak Ridges Moraine if necessary in order to ensure a reasonable workload and the provision of a reliable model - with cursor-activated pop-ups or links to additional information about each area. It is anticipated that the top layer of the map would show watershed names and boundaries with major upland headwater areas in a distinctive shade.Information for each type of area for pop-up information could include: Watershed InformationWatershed name boundaries receiving water body and stream order at mouthTotal Area and percentages in water natural cover development and transportation/utility use etcA macro water budget indicating average annual rainfall infiltration to groundwater and stream flowMunicipal boundaries including First Nations territory total population and key uses of water andConservation Authority (possible link to it and/or watershed current conditions report) Headwater InformationMajor upland headwater areasPercentage of area within each watershed in water settlement areas transportation/utility use and natural cover ArcIMS 9.xPercentage of flow to the watershed from MUHA(s)Cumulative facts about MUHAs overlapping watershed dividesThe key requirement for the interactive map would be to produce GeoPDFs (or GIS enabled PDFs) for online distribution. However OHI encourages the participants to explore the possibility of developing an online web mapping system linked to an underlying geospatial and tabular database. The GIS system should embrace an MNR or similar protocol that would allow future layers to be added and managed by OHI on information related to water quantity quality Permits to Take Water spill data areas with agricultural tile drainage moisture regimes wetlands and proposed wetland restoration sites watershed report cards etc.Finally the project team should identify other potential projects that could build be built upon or enhance this project such as data from MNR Southern Regions strategic landscape planning initiative for Natural Heritage Systems sites for possible headwater regeneration areas or aspects related to agricultural drainage mapping.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Durham Region State of the Environment Poster Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The State of the Environment (SOE) Map was originally produced in 1999 as a full-colour double-sided 24 ins x 36 ins public education poster map to raise awareness and facilitate sustainable decisions with respect to the quality and integrity of key environmental indicators. The updated Map will benchmark the 1999 data with new up-to-date 10-year comparison data. There will be print and web based versions. The Map is an excellent visual educational tool. It has a two-fold purpose. On one side it provides a detailed illustration of Durham Regions natural environment and human activity features which include waterways major landforms elevations major roads trails and parks forest and wetlands and more. It is the only map of its kind in Durham Region to encompass a wide variety of environmental features on one easy to read map. The other side provides an analysis of five key environmental indicators categories (Green Space; Air; Water; Energy; and Waste) and how human activities and actions in any one of these areas can affect our health and the health of the environment. This project reaches out to teachers students individuals business and community leaders political and government representatives in Durham Region to encourage behavioural changes that can save money increase efficiency and help improve our community and environment at the same time.Durham Region is spread over one thousand square miles and includes five municipalities and three northern townships. As an emerging power in the Greater Toronto Area Durham Region has one of the fastest growing populations in Canada. Recent forecasts show the regions population increasing from 586000 in 2005 to 150600 in 2031 and its employment increasing from 180000 in 2005 to 398900 in 2031. (Durham Region Official Plan Review Proposed Amendment Planning Committee Report 2006-P-39).This growth positions Durham as a dynamic region with a wide range of advantages and subsequent challenges to strike a balance between economic social and natural environment interests.The SOE Map is intended to introduce Durham Region to the concept of State of the Environment (SOE) reporting. SOE reporting is a mechanism for understanding changes their trends causes and impacts. In addition it integrates social and economic factors to outline some of the things individuals can do to tackle the environmental problems. It is also a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of policies and practices to provide a basis for improved decision-making. We have been fortunate to have interest from representatives of five local municipalities five conservation authorities and the regional government who have made a commitment to volunteer their time and resources to help us collect the data. When the updated Map is complete our Volunteer Advisory Committee has also offered in-kind services to promote the Map through the communications in their respective municipalities. This includes distribution and promotion through their regular newsletters telephone inquiries directed to the website and on their websites. In addition to our advisory committee we also have developed partnerships with the Durham District School Board and the Durham Catholic District School Board through the EcoSchools program to enhance the awareness and outreach of this project<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database Design/Processing- Spatial/Statistical Analysis- Presentation/Visualization- Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The Map will be updated with 10-year comparison data of the five environmental indicator areas: Green Space, Air, Water, Energy, and Waste. There will be print and web based versions. For example each indicator covers a number of topics. For example: The environmental indicators for Water includes subjects such as water consumption water supply water supply systems water pollution control plants sewage suspended solids toxic substances beaches and salt/sand usage. An analysis of water consumption would provide data on residential water consumption per person measured over a six-year period showing annual changes in consumption. The What We Can Do section provides a variety of tools and strategies aimed at municipalities business and individuals to reduce water consumption and improve water quality. Each indicator classification is similarly analyzed. The student will have plenty of opportunity to help us define the project specifications providing that the goals deliver.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Cultural Asset and Mapping Repository<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Curve Lake First Nation is located centrally in the Traditional Anishnabek Nation Territories. Cultural assets are both tangible in the form of pictures sites locations and artifacts but also include intangible elements of oral stories practices language and relationships. Intangible assets may be gathered using recording media technology and which stories names or words may be linked spatially to a known area of origin or reference point. More and more the public and planning agencies are requesting and drawing on cultural information from First Nations in order to conserve lands or in order for comprehensive planning reviews to take place therefore warranting a means to navigate and geographically display all those elements in a manner that does not compromise the sensitivity of some information. Also to conserve and enliven cultural assets/our culture for future generations a methodology to capture preserve locate and display cultural information is beneficial. Furthermore it is increasingly recognized that our Traditions of Oral stories contain evidential and historical proof and information that links our ancestors and our culture to Nature and the land. The information contained in our stories is then valuable to both cultural and ecological conservation. The ability to display the relationship of stories to places or tangible features further substantiates the value of our cultural traditions. It is important to understand that much of this information is of a sensitive nature requiring restrictive access and/or measures to limit buffer or scale sensitive information that is shared or displayed. Also all intellectual property rights rest with the First Nation Knowledge Holders. Curve Lake First Nation has a cultural centre and library where culturally relevant assets are housed and many are already catalogued or archived. The current archives are not spatially referenced and are not formatted in an agile database. A project to capture intangible assets through media recordings is being launched. These assets will need to be catalogued and geographically referenced as well.Therefore this project is to achieve the following goals:To create a central database to catalogue all those tangible and intangible cultural assets; and which assigns sensitivity scales to each attribute; and which is contains spatial references to a site or area for each asset so that cultural maps for public consumption for assessment management and for learning may be generated. To create a user guide for the repository so that First Nation staff can continue to upload and update information. To understand the relationships between tangible and intangible assets/sites and stories and therefore to quantify through the ability to display those relationships that have been communicated through % overlap and through statistical analysis. A method to restrict or limit access and display of sensitive data such as passwords and the ability to display sensitive information using buffered/scaled values so as not to reveal exact locations to the public (such as large-scale points or outlines or buffered points/locations)<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> <br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A GIS (geospatial) database containing attributes for cultural assets including: asset number; type of asset (tangible/intangible- i.e. story (audio recording or DVD) artifact site etc); date collected; original period/timeframe; main relational relevance (site people nature; historical occurrence etc); sensitivity (high med low); geographical reference point/area; etc. A database template- The database is user-friendly and has the ability to upload new data through an interface and which includes the ability to assign or alter spatial reference points/areas for each attribute and the ability to assign and therefore immediately alter the display of higher sensitivity classes.Statistical Analysis of relationship of intangible to tangible assetsHow-to-guide for data upload3 maps:All cultural assets (tangible and intangible distinguished and related through overlap)- % overlap assessed and statistical results displayedAll cultural assets with sensitivity classes noted- and (automatic or assigned) buffers for high sensitivity classesA webpage ready map that only references and highlights geographical sites with recorded stories/footage and which footage may be downloadedPresentation to Band Council on results<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Necrogeography and Lakeview Cemetery GIS Applications for an Historic Ontario Municipality<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Established in 1836 as a small post office the Hamlet of Madoc grew gradually as a lumber and farming community. Following substantial development in the 1860s due to discovery of gold-bearing quartz the Village of Madoc was incorporated in 1877 and is recognized as the heart of the Municipality of Centre Hastings.The Lakeview Cemetery located on the eastern edge of the Village of Madoc has played a central role in the history of the community in the past and continues to serve the municipality as a focal point of personal and public remembrance and reflection.The Municipality of Centre Hastings has traditionally maintained vital cemetery information using standard practices seen in many Canadian municipalities such as the maintenance of older hand-written registry books paper maps diagrams and miscellaneous historical documents. All of the aforementioned documentation have experienced high levels of natural deterioration with an inevitable loss of information once the documents become illegible.The municipality invested in a database designed specifically for cemetery records seven years ago that compliments the historic documentation and paper maps but is widely recognized as incomplete unreliable and prone to error when performing simple queries.Concern over cultural resource conservation of Lakeview Cemetery has prompted the Municipality of Centre Hastings to search for a convenient GIS-based solution that will aide in the location of existing internments increase quality of records management enhance facilities and ground management and planning and conserve historic information. It is anticipated the project will have multiple deliverables (addressed below) and will be readily and easily accessible through a variety of platforms and media to municipal staff historical societies and the general public.The County of Hastings GIS Section traditionally oversees the development and maintenance of a County-based GIS program which incorporates fourteen (14) member municipalities of which one is the Municipality of Centre Hastings. County GIS staff will fully support the project and act as a liaison between Fleming College Coop Students and the municipality providing data and technical assistance as much as possible for duration of the project. County GIS staff have full access to ArcEditor ArcGIS (10) ArcServer ArcPad as well as multiple peripherals (GPS unit large scale plotter digital camera).The Municipality of Centre Hastings currently has two (2) licenses for ArcGIS (9.x) and one staff member trained in an introductory ESRI GIS course.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> data Acquisition/Preprocessing- Database design/Processing- Presentation/Visualization- web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The Municipality of Centre Hastings requests the following deliverables listed in order of importance.A desktop GIS-based application (database/map) for the creation maintenance and storage of cemetery information. The map files must be in ESRI format (shapefile) with the following projection: NAD83 UTM Zone 18N. The database should be designed in Microsoft Access and linked to cemetery plots with unique identifiers. The desktop application must be accompanied with a simple user-friendly query for locating cemetery plot by multiple names and plot designation. This application will be available on both desktops and will be edited by municipal staff.A desktop GIS Viewer platform to be available to municipal employees so as to enable viewing of cemetery information (no editing required/allowed). A small light-weight application such as ArcExplorer would be preferable. Design should be simple yet of high design quality so as to facilitate the use of the system. All viewers are employees with no GIS experience.Digital cartographic products for wall display in municipal offices. Maps should be comprehensive clear informative and be of excellent design quality.Digital cartographic products to be distributed on the municipal website and other locations as deemed necessary in the future. Multiple formats would be desirable (PDF JPG BMP).<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> I love my watershed<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> The OHI seeks student support to develop an app to allow photographs and a small amount text to describe watershed locations to be posted to a map of Ontario. The app will both allow people to share photos of sites they find important, and to find and visit sites shared by others. 

The concept for the app, as described below but to be developed with the student team, is to provide a short list of digital questions to be filled in, after which the photo could be uploaded. In addition to name, e-mail address, a user name, and a password, the app would:
• Ask users to ensure their phone provides the GIS location or to provide another location-finder to be discussed, such as an intersection or watershed; 
• Suggest a title for the photo; and
• Require the person to select one of several on-screen icons to indicate the category of the photo being uploaded.

The photo, its icon, and other information would then be posted to a website using Google Fusion, which if possible could show the boundaries of Ontario’s watersheds. End-users would click on icons, by location, to open the photo and the short description. 

Back-end database management aspects of this project include:
• The management and privacy of personal information from the person taking the photo. ie – their name, user name, email address, and what photos they have posted;
• Receiving and posting app information to the website, including the poster’s user name, putting the selected icon in its accurate location, and ensuring the photo and its description open when a user clicks on the icon; and,
• Being able to see photos by who posted them, icon type, watershed, and any other desirable aspects developed by the team.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> • Ability to work both independently and in a team
• Good organization, communication, and reporting skills
• Strong use of data, spatial analysis, and programming skills
• Inquisitive approach to research and the ability to refine methodologies
• Past experience with MNR-LIO data-bases and protocols would be an asset
• Confidence and directness in communication with the OHI on project progress toward desired or agreed alternate outcomes. If you’ve got an idea, share it. If you need help, ask for it. We don’t bite.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> • Project experience may also enhance employment opportunities in both the private and public sectors.
• While the OHI unable to scout possible funding for further work stemming from and following the completion of this project, we would consider supporting any student-generated concepts for grant requests.
• While students engaged in this project may have graduated by the fall of 2018, the project may be a good candidate for submission to the student poster competition at the annual, November, Latournel Conservation Symposium.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> 12/12/17 15:10<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Resettlement Project - Woody Island<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> In the 1960's hundreds of communities in Newfoundland were resettled under the banner of modernization. People were moved from isolated coves and islands to communities with easier access to roads and other infrastructure. 

Many people who experienced resettlement have passed away and the specific memories of the places in which they once lived are fading. The last generation to live in these places if fast approaching old age. It is the goal of this project to capture their memories before it's too late.

This project will be a demo, focusing on a single community: Woody Island, Placentia Bay. My father's family moved from Woody Island in 1967.

This demo can then be presented to academics and funders to determine if there is interest in expanding the scope of the project.

The goal of this project is to leverage aerial photos to develop an online, interactive map of Woody Island as it was just before resettlement. Computer Users (historians, former inhabitants, relatives and family) may edit and add to the map to in an effort to fully capture the history of Woody Island.

Some initial possibilities for interactivity include:

1. Identifying structures, who lived in them and when.
2. Identifying key local landmarks and the local names used for them.
3. Uploading and linking family photos to structures and landmarks.
4. Capture stories about people, structures and landmarks.

Before users can undertake such activities, a baseline interactive map and dataset is required.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students must be independent workers yet capable of collaboration. Have the ability to interpret aerial photography and create a dataset from it. Place datasets into a custom web app, offering end users the ability to manipulate and add data as required. Must be willing to ask questions when stuck.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> The baseline dataset will be generic, for example "Building A", etc. Once the demo goes live, users may edit the data. A demo of the initial baseline set should be fine.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Peterborough’s Time Mapping 2.0: Exploring Historic Aerial Imagery through the Years<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Historical aerial images are an ideal resource for assessing changes in time and performing land change analysis. The City of Peterborough has a collection of historical images that lack spatial reference, and as a result are not useful in a GIS context. There is 7 different years’ worth of image tiles. All of the tiles have been scanned to PDF and some have been converted to TIFF. The goal of this project is to transform as many of the aerial images from their raw state to a data product which can be used within the GIS environment. Once the images are referenced and rectified, the final outcome will be to publish the images as a service and create a web based mapping application. This will be a central location to show and analyze the newly georeferenced aerial images alongside existing imagery services that the City of Peterborough has. This project was initially completed in 2017 through an automated process using HAP Software through PCI Geomatica. However, the final mosaicked datasets displayed a significant amount of error and the need to have the images georeferenced and QA/QC again from scratch manually or using a different process is required. Errors included duplicate image tiles, roads not being continuous, and water bodies were skewed. Students will need to come up with the best solution that produces a georeferenced dataset with a high level of accuracy within the timelines of the Collaborative Project. More can be found in project proposal doc, not all informaiton could fit into this chart.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students should have strong research to come up with the best method to ortho rectify the images and output an accurate result. Database skills will also be an asset to ensure solid naming conventions and folder maintenance so the project can be passed on to Geomatics/Mapping seamlessly. Strong project management skills will allow for the referenced mosaic datasets be verifying and checking against current aerial images so roads and rivers match. This will then allow for the City of Peterborough to confidently release it for City staff and citizens to use. Peterborough’s Time Mapping 2.0 would be an ideal project for a group of students who are interested in image analyses and remote sensing. Students should also be comfortable with creating a pleasing web mapping application and be confident that their project outcomes will be accurate for publishing.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Cover Crops Anonymous<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> - Farmers across the province have planted different types and combinations of cover crops 
- These farmers have different soil types, slopes, drainage classes, etc
- Some of the farmers have “demonstration plots” where they try new things before expanding a practice across large acreages

We want to create a “Community of Practice” where:
- Farmers could search for other farmers who have planted certain cover crops or blends of cover crops to share their experiences
- Farmers may want to find other farmers who are on similar soil types and heat units to compare these experiences

From a research standpoint, we want to be able to compare apples to apples, so we need to “categorize” these plots by validity:
- Lowest level – small plot, not replicated, less rigour to analysis and evaluation of results
- Medium level – mid size plots, replicated, maybe even with a control plot; Some level of analysis and evaluation of results
- God Star – larger plots, replicated, with control plots, lots of data collection<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Some agricultural background would be helpful, although not necessary. Soils, geography or geology would be helpful also.

<b>Project Description:</b> Areas of Representation (AoR) – A spatial ecology based tool for evaluating conservation networks using ArcGIS<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> In 2006 the WWF-Canada launched the Assessment of Representation Analyst toolset as an ArcGIS 9.x extension. The development of this tool was meant to establish a framework for large-scale gap analysis to be conducted to evaluated the ecological representativeness of protected area networks. The goal was to produce an automated decision-support tool for resource managers and conservation planners. Representativeness is assessed by the tool using a variety of metrics, such as size required to maintain viable populations of native species and sustain ecological processes, environmental gradients, important habitat types, and habitat quality.
However, since the original tool was constructed for ArcGIS 9.x, it was implemented through VBA. Our hope is to bring the AoR toolset into the ArcPro landscape by updating and reconstructing the original VBA extension as an ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox. Once this is complete Students would have the opportunity use the AoR tool to conduct an up-to-date assessment of Canadian conservation area networks (or sample thereof), producing cartographic products to communicate their results. The results of this analysis could be published by the WWF-Canada and distributed nationally. Additionally, potential exists to produce an ESRI Web-App to promote the re-release of the tool.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Python Programming, Cartographic Design using ArcMap/Pro or MapIllustrator, Spatial Analysis with ArcMap/Pro, ESRI web app builder.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> The project, tool, and products will be able to be showcased by Fleming College; however, the license and rights to the tool will be held by WWF-Canada. Fleming College will not have the rights to distribute the tool itself. A license agreement may need to be signed upon beginning this project.

<b>Project Description:</b> Ottawa Valley Connecting Trails and Tourism<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Renfrew County and the Ottawa Valley are top destinations for ATV'ing in Ontario with well over 600 km of ATV and multi-use trails which include municipal railbeds, crown land, county forestry, county and municipal roads and private landowners. The sport is growing, more and more are looking for online and digital sources for finding and following trails. As the largest County in Ontario in terms of area, and one of the fastest growing ATV clubs in Ontario, we are at a critical point where we are restructuring our entire trail signing and naming system to ensure safety, identify trail technicality ratings, enable ease of access for emergency personnel, include GPS coordinated RV spots and signage, and heritage designation of trails that will connect riders to communities and ATV tourism. We have a series of videos of our trail system, and once our trail system is restructured and signed, we want to be able to have a dynamic website that will allow riders to see determine which trails best suit their riding ability and interest, which services are along that trail for them to plan routes, provide video of what the trail consists of for terrain, include length in time and km to complete a trail, and provide some history and points of interest from the heritage of the land and community. Once the trails are verified digitally, this means an interactive component to our website that can be populated with video, interactive maps, downloadable material and that we can update, maintain and promote. Our demographic on the trails and the technology on the trail has changed. We have more families, seniors, youth and new Canadians and urban riders using the trails with limited experience, more powerful equipment and more reliant on digital devices to remain safe on the trails. Our trails are also multi-use which means walkers, hikers, cyclists, cross-country skiers and dirt bikes would all likely use the platform and benefit from this project. As a not for profit volunteer-run organization we need assistance to map, restructure, and digitize our trail system. RCATV is a member of the Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> An understanding of how to use and take GPS data and digitize it in a format that would be accessible on smartphones and on websites. 
Experience with or ability to update data to a new or use existing app for mobile devices.
Access to or experience with video equipment
Ability to do cartography and mapping
Assistance with graphic design for new physical and downloadable maps
Ability to work in the field to acquire and validate trail data if possible
Ability to research and working with our trails committee subject matter experts on trail marking,<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> Our information is public and we highly encourage promotion and use of trails. The exception of the contact information of any private land owners.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> 11/24/2017 19:38:05<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Environmental Health Map<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> There are close to 1000 food premises in Peterborough City and County. They include, among others, restaurants, supermarkets, butcher shops, and chip trucks as well as cafeterias and kitchens located in churches, daycares and long-term care facilities. The goal of the Peterborough Public Health food safety program is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illness (food poisoning) in Peterborough City and County by routinely inspecting these establishments to ensure their compliance with the Food Premises Regulation, R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 562. We are required to maintain an up to date food safety disclosure system on our website (see link). 
Peterborough Public Health is responsible for the inspection of all public recreational water facilities (pools, spas, wading pools and splash pads) in the City of Peterborough and Peterborough County. Public recreational water facilities are inspected regularly by public health inspectors to prevent and reduce the risk of water borne-illnesses and life-threatening injuries.
Peterborough Public Health also maintains a routine surveillance program for public beaches during summer months to ensure that the water quality is safe for swimming. The water samples are tested for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. A public beach is “posted” when the level of E. coli in the water exceeds a certain limit and is unsafe for recreational use, including human bathing (swimming). When a beach is posted, signage will be placed around the beach area to inform the public. A beach is “closed” when a significant risk to human health and safety has been identified, such as signs of hazardous or infectious material in the water or when there is a blue-green algae bloom. Swimming in the water is NOT permitted when a beach is closed and public access to the beach will be restricted or eliminated.
The purpose of this project is to create a map that outlines where inspected food premises are in Peterborough City and County and links to a data base where the most current inspection report sits (HealthSpace). The map should be versatile enough so that we could expand/adapt the map to include the status of beaches and inspected recreational water facilities in the future<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The students will have to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Peterborough Public Health.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Interactive Neighbourhood Profile Map<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> The goal of the project is to create a visually stimulating Geocortex site, to display Statistics Canada data in a variety of interactive and thematic mapping formats. The viewer would illustrate different demographic variables (e.g. population, household size, age, marital status, ethnic origin, etc.) for various census years (i.e. 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016) by each of the City's neighbourhoods.

The City of Pickering purchased custom profiles of demographic data from Statistics Canada for each of the City’s neighbourhoods. The City is in the process of acquiring 2016 data from Statistics Canada, as well. This data is currently in Statistics Canada's own tabular format (Browser 20/20) which can be imported into Excel. Once the demographic data is imported into Excel, the data will need to be processed and sorted by field and neighbourhood and joined geographic data. This would then be uploaded into a GeoCortex viewer that would be designed to be easy to use by City staff and the public.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> See Systems section. In addition, familiarity with Census data would be an asset.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> If selected, the College would need to enter into a standard sub- license agreement for the use of the Statistics Canada data<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> 7/11/17 11:48<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Necrogeography2.0: Continuing to Map Peterborough’s Little Lake Cemetery<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Little Lake Cemetery is a non-profit and non-denominational cemetery located in the heart of Peterborough, Ontario. It is one of the oldest cemeteries in the area and contains graves spanning a rich history from 1850 to the present. In 2007 a contract worker for the City of Peterborough created a GIS database of cemetery plots containing information such as grave/monument location, family name, condition, oldest death date, material type, and a photo. 

This data had not been updated or maintained until 2016-2017 when 3C Solutions (Previous Fleming Collaborative Project 907-PW) conducted QA/QC work on the data to refine the locational accuracy of the existing points and to correct data inconsistencies. Project deliverables included a corrected geodatabase, a historical spatial analysis, a web application providing cemetery inventory searching, an offline application designed to collect monument point data and a large format map for display in City Hall.

Necrogeography2.0 will continue to build upon the excellent work of 3C Solutions by conducting field work to fill in gaps in the data as well as modifying the existing database to create a more robust and detailed dataset. They will also produce professional graphic outputs such as a marketing brochure and large scale map product.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Strong database skills order to normalize and expand the existing Little Lake Cemetery database. An excellent graphic design background would be ideal to create an attractive and easy to use web application. It would be an interesting project for students with an interest in early Ontario history and a sense of the importance of cultural resource conservation. The student(s) should feel comfortable to tackle this project with a creative and innovative approach, while at the same time maintaining an appropriate degree of respect and integrity regarding the nature of the cemetery information.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Forest Planning Inventory<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> We are beginning to work on a comprehensive Forest Management Plan. This project requires support from a forest inventory database. We have numerous sources of inventory data available, but they are in different formats, containing various pieces of information. We would like to compile these different data sets into a single master dataset which we can use for purposes such as timber harvest planning, identification of high conservation value lands, and growth and yield calculations. The automation of the updating of this and related datasets, or the digitization of data collection, would also be good deliverables.

This project could be mostly completed remotely, but site visits to Haliburton Forest would be good for coordination and the general education of the student(s) in forest management issues.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> I have discussed this project with Storm Robinson. Basic exposure to forest management principles. Good communication and organization skills. Geoprocessing skills (combing multiple overlapping spatial datasets). Design (identifying items of inputs for use in the dataset). Visual design (desigining symbologies for easy representation of complex data, preparing the maps for use in plans and reports) Programming (automation of inputs into an arcmap database from excel or other tabular data).<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> We are relative novices at Haliburton Forest when it comes to data aquistion and management, and gis database management and manipulation.

<b>Project Description:</b> Strategies and Approaches for Implementing Long-Term Management, Monitoring and Stewardship Programs for the Haliburton Highlands Land Trust<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Habitat loss and degradation are the greatest threats to biodiversity in Canada today. To mitigate this process in the Haliburton Highlands, the HHLT is acquiring lands of ecological and cultural significance for conservation purposes. It works to select only those properties which clearly have long-term benefit to the public and can be maintained by the land trust in perpetuity.

Through Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Ecological Gifts Program, four properties totaling almost 700 acres have currently been donated to the HHLT. Ecological gifts are made in perpetuity. The HHLT is responsible for the long term management and conservation of ecological gifts and their ecologically sensitive features. To this end the HHLT is required to, and is responsible for, preparing management plans, setting up stewardship programs and initiating and maintaining monitoring programs for each of its properties. 

The HHLT is currently working towards the development and implementation of strategies and approaches that would ensure it can meet its management, monitoring and stewardship responsibilities. 

There are two components to the project:

1. Development of a GIS Spatial Database to Assist in Strategic Planning and Property Stewardship Planning and Management.

The purpose of this project is to develop the mapping and data management tool that will enable the HHLT to build its geospatial database using publically available data from organizations such as various government agencies including Land Information Ontario (LIO), Natural Heritage Database, OMNRF, Ontario Centre for Remote Sensing, local municipalities as well as integrating GIS data (both map and data) currently stored on various consultants databases. This will enable the HHLT to more effectively manage its various properties over a long period of time. 

The GIS database will provide the HHLT with a long term strategic planning tool that will enable it to undertake, proactively, the identification of potentially ecologically significant properties across the Haliburton Highlands. 

Finally, the GIS system will facilitate the ability of the HHLT to communicate, share data and interact with other land management organizations with similar long term land stewardship objectives.

2. The development of spatial data applications and analysis tools using combinations of the various mapping layers and integration of autecological species requirements to assist in the identification of potentially ecologically significant areas and corridor analysis which will help the HHLT to better focus its community education and property acquisition activities across the Haliburton Highlands. These applications will also facilitate the ability of the HHLT to communicate and co-ordinate with adjacent Land Trusts and other conservation organizations responsible for the protection of critical habitat and species of concern.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students will have a basic knowledge in the use and application of ARC GIS software; understanding of how to build the spatial data layers available through various government and other organizations in Ontario; knowledge of how to develop spatial database applications to facilitate the integration and use of the spatial database layers and species or landscape ecological knowledge;<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> HHLT has proprietary geospatial information on Species at Risk (SAR) which will need to be protected from public scrutiny as part of the project.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Multi-modal transport analysis to demonstrate alternatives to your current commute<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Alternatives to simply driving to work exist, but are often overlooked. This analysis would present a full-range of multi-modal transport options for workers to get to a specific place of work. The software to be used is ArcGIS Network Analyst along with (free) tools to interpret GTFS transit data. The data required is a chosen place of work, the start locations for people making the commute, GTFS data for the chosen transit network, and a transport network that may include but is not limited to: streets, walking paths, transit corridors, cycling paths, trails, pedestrian, etc. Ride sharing and car-pooling options could also be considered. We encourage you to get creative with transport modes!

The commute options could be presented to each worker daily with the best alternative(s) in terms of time, distance, carbon emissions, or any other useful indicator of performance. The end user interaction with this information could be performed using an Esri ArcGIS Online Web Map or an iPhone/Android Smartphone App. This interface could even include live feeds of current locations for other workers with available car-pool space, for example. Again, get creative!

Ultimately, we will result with a workforce for one company that is using smarter options for their daily commute, thus improving traffic, safety, air quality, and overall well being for everyone.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Plan A Visit- KTCT<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Development of an trail tourism planning and service year-round map for the- City of Kawartha Lakes to be installed on the KTCT web site (www.ktct.ca). If time permits develop a KTCT app importing this information. Using this as model develop in the future similar trail planning and service maps for Peterborough County and Northumberland County. This project will produce an listing link to web sites that would identify bike, walking/hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing and snowmobile services, food/beverage, lodging and camping and directions and parking within a 2KM distance on both sides of the existing trail. It could also include bike shop rentals and shuttles and transportation. For an example, check out https://gaptrail.org The information will be featured on the KTCT web site, twitter and facebook.

KTCT receives request regularly for this type of information. KTCT response with basic information. If the person was able to "plan" his or her trip on line it would provide them control over what they want to do, increase tourism in the CKL and increase business contact by the trail user.

Presently there is no trail information focused on the services, food and accommodation provided related to travel on the Kawartha Trans Canada Trail in the City of Kawartha Lakes. There is potential to expand this project to include other sections the Trans Canada Trail (Peterborough/Uxbridge) or to use this developed model to provide similar web site contact information anywhere in Canada.

This project will:
allow for potential trail users to plan on-line their visit to the Kawartha Trans Canada Trail. If time permits to develop an App of this information that will allow to be downloaded for free.
In summary, the project requires research, design and include this informatoin on an existing web-GIS based KTCT trail map. The map must have the ability to integrate or link with TCT national, TCT Ontario, local tourism websites. The map/ information will identify and display accommodation, food, services and related support services within 2 km on both sides along the entire KTCT route.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Computer skills and knowledge – web based technology
Organizational Skills – information collection and presentation
GIS application – using existing TCT trail data and apply to location Communication skills – deal with variety of people who will provide and review project information
Strong interest in the project and its benefits to the economic impact for tourism and businesses in CKL
Team that can work independently and meet deadlines<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> There will be some travel and supply funds available for this project. There is a $400 budget for the project BUT this will need to be confirmed prior to commencement of the project by the Trans Canada Trail Partners.

<b>Project Description:</b> Data Collection and Management Solutions for Small Businesses<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Finding a cost effective and efficient means for a small business to accurately (sub meter) collect tree inventory data that is easily manipulated and transferred into mainstream data management software (i.e., Excel) and plotted into design software such as Auto CAD. The key words here are "effective", "efficient", and "cost effective". There are many industry and non-industry related products available on the market. However, when you can't afford (or justify) thousands of dollars for equipment and annually licensing fees, you are left trying to cobble together a process with equipment that isn't 100% compatible (let alone accurate) that requires multiple steps leaving you data vulnerable to corruption.

<b>Project Description:</b> I love my watershed<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> The OHI seeks student support to develop an app to allow photographs and a small amount text to describe watershed locations to be posted to a map of Ontario. The app will both allow people to share photos of sites they find important, and to find and visit sites shared by others. 

The concept for the app, as described below but to be developed with the student team, is to provide a short list of digital questions to be filled in, after which the photo could be uploaded. In addition to name, e-mail address, a user name, and a password, the app would:
• Ask users to ensure their phone provides the GIS location or to provide another location-finder to be discussed, such as an intersection or watershed; 
• Suggest a title for the photo; and
• Require the person to select one of several on-screen icons to indicate the category of the photo being uploaded.

The photo, its icon, and other information would then be posted to a website using Google Fusion, which if possible could show the boundaries of Ontario’s watersheds. End-users would click on icons, by location, to open the photo and the short description. 

Back-end database management aspects of this project include:
• The management and privacy of personal information from the person taking the photo. ie – their name, user name, email address, and what photos they have posted;
• Receiving and posting app information to the website, including the poster’s user name, putting the selected icon in its accurate location, and ensuring the photo and its description open when a user clicks on the icon; and,
• Being able to see photos by who posted them, icon type, watershed, and any other desirable aspects developed by the team.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> • Ability to work both independently and in a team
• Good organization, communication, and reporting skills
• Strong use of data, spatial analysis, and programming skills
• Inquisitive approach to research and the ability to refine methodologies
• Past experience with MNR-LIO data-bases and protocols would be an asset
• Confidence and directness in communication with the OHI on project progress toward desired or agreed alternate outcomes. If you’ve got an idea, share it. If you need help, ask for it. We don’t bite.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> • Project experience may also enhance employment opportunities in both the private and public sectors.
• While the OHI unable to scout possible funding for further work stemming from and following the completion of this project, we would consider supporting any student-generated concepts for grant requests.
• While students engaged in this project may have graduated by the fall of 2018, the project may be a good candidate for submission to the student poster competition at the annual, November, Latournel Conservation Symposium.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> The Resettlement Project - Woody Island<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> In the 1960's hundreds of communities in Newfoundland were resettled under the banner of modernization. People were moved from isolated coves and islands to communities with easier access to roads and other infrastructure. 

Many people who experienced resettlement have passed away and the specific memories of the places in which they once lived are fading. The last generation to live in these places if fast approaching old age. It is the goal of this project to capture their memories before it's too late.

This project will be a demo, focusing on a single community: Woody Island, Placentia Bay. My father's family moved from Woody Island in 1967.

This demo can then be presented to academics and funders to determine if there is interest in expanding the scope of the project.

The goal of this project is to leverage aerial photos to develop an online, interactive map of Woody Island as it was just before resettlement. Computer Users (historians, former inhabitants, relatives and family) may edit and add to the map to in an effort to fully capture the history of Woody Island.

Some initial possibilities for interactivity include:

1. Identifying structures, who lived in them and when.
2. Identifying key local landmarks and the local names used for them.
3. Uploading and linking family photos to structures and landmarks.
4. Capture stories about people, structures and landmarks.

Before users can undertake such activities, a baseline interactive map and dataset is required.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students must be independent workers yet capable of collaboration. Have the ability to interpret aerial photography and create a dataset from it. Place datasets into a custom web app, offering end users the ability to manipulate and add data as required. Must be willing to ask questions when stuck.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> The baseline dataset will be generic, for example "Building A", etc. Once the demo goes live, users may edit the data. A demo of the initial baseline set should be fine.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Peterborough’s Time Mapping 2.0: Exploring Historic Aerial Imagery through the Years<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Historical aerial images are an ideal resource for assessing changes in time and performing land change analysis. The City of Peterborough has a collection of historical images that lack spatial reference, and as a result are not useful in a GIS context. There is 7 different years’ worth of image tiles. All of the tiles have been scanned to PDF and some have been converted to TIFF. The goal of this project is to transform as many of the aerial images from their raw state to a data product which can be used within the GIS environment. Once the images are referenced and rectified, the final outcome will be to publish the images as a service and create a web based mapping application. This will be a central location to show and analyze the newly georeferenced aerial images alongside existing imagery services that the City of Peterborough has. This project was initially completed in 2017 through an automated process using HAP Software through PCI Geomatica. However, the final mosaicked datasets displayed a significant amount of error and the need to have the images georeferenced and QA/QC again from scratch manually or using a different process is required. Errors included duplicate image tiles, roads not being continuous, and water bodies were skewed. Students will need to come up with the best solution that produces a georeferenced dataset with a high level of accuracy within the timelines of the Collaborative Project. More can be found in project proposal doc, not all informaiton could fit into this chart.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students should have strong research to come up with the best method to ortho rectify the images and output an accurate result. Database skills will also be an asset to ensure solid naming conventions and folder maintenance so the project can be passed on to Geomatics/Mapping seamlessly. Strong project management skills will allow for the referenced mosaic datasets be verifying and checking against current aerial images so roads and rivers match. This will then allow for the City of Peterborough to confidently release it for City staff and citizens to use. Peterborough’s Time Mapping 2.0 would be an ideal project for a group of students who are interested in image analyses and remote sensing. Students should also be comfortable with creating a pleasing web mapping application and be confident that their project outcomes will be accurate for publishing.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Lower Winnipeg River Sturgeon Monitoring Project<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Over the past decade with the help of community partners, Kenora District MNRF has been monitoring the movements of Lake Sturgeon in the Lower Winnipeg River. Using telemetric tags, the movements of twelve sub-adult fish have been tracked throughout the river system. The objective of this project is to take the information collected and store it in a safe and stable way for access to this information in future years. Our goal is to use this information to analyze fish behavior within the river system in hopes of strengthen our knowledge of how lake sturgeon are using the river, including determining significant habitat such as spawning and feeding. We are looking for a clear way to inform our community partners of the project outcomes. We are also hoping to identify behavioral trends in the Winnipeg River sturgeon and use this information to help make management decisions in the future.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A student with a biological background would be an ideal candidate for the project. Students who are experienced with data management would be an ideal candidate as well. The project has been ongoing for a number of years the data set is large. This project would be interesting for someone interested in managing species at risk as the Lake Sturgeon is listed as such with their Northwestern Ontario population.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Automated mapping of mega-scale glacial lineations in Eastern Ontario<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> The purpose of this project is to automatically delineate and map mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs). This will in collaboration with De Beers Exploration Canada (http://www.debeersgroup.com/en/explore-de-beers/exploration.html). MSGLs are large-scale, elongated landforms formed from fast-flowing ice. Previous studies have focused on the morphology of MSGLs, their relation to paleo ice streams, and their prevalence throughout Canada. Recent research has focused on developing theories for the creation of MSGLs, as such, there is now an increased need for automated mapping of these landforms.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Cover Crops Anonymous<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> - Farmers across the province have planted different types and combinations of cover crops 
- These farmers have different soil types, slopes, drainage classes, etc
- Some of the farmers have “demonstration plots” where they try new things before expanding a practice across large acreages

We want to create a “Community of Practice” where:
- Farmers could search for other farmers who have planted certain cover crops or blends of cover crops to share their experiences
- Farmers may want to find other farmers who are on similar soil types and heat units to compare these experiences

From a research standpoint, we want to be able to compare apples to apples, so we need to “categorize” these plots by validity:
- Lowest level – small plot, not replicated, less rigour to analysis and evaluation of results
- Medium level – mid size plots, replicated, maybe even with a control plot; Some level of analysis and evaluation of results
- God Star – larger plots, replicated, with control plots, lots of data collection<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Some agricultural background would be helpful, although not necessary. Soils, geography or geology would be helpful also. This project is meant to bring farmers together and create a Community of Practice - so interest or experience in team building, communication, education and outreach would also be helpful.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Areas of Representation (AoR) – A spatial ecology based tool for evaluating conservation networks using ArcGIS<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> In 2006 the WWF-Canada launched the Assessment of Representation Analyst toolset as an ArcGIS 9.x extension. The development of this tool was meant to establish a framework for large-scale gap analysis to be conducted to evaluated the ecological representativeness of protected area networks. The goal was to produce an automated decision-support tool for resource managers and conservation planners. Representativeness is assessed by the tool using a variety of metrics, such as size required to maintain viable populations of native species and sustain ecological processes, environmental gradients, important habitat types, and habitat quality.
However, since the original tool was constructed for ArcGIS 9.x, it was implemented through VBA. Our hope is to bring the AoR toolset into the ArcPro landscape by updating and reconstructing the original VBA extension as an ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox. Once this is complete Students would have the opportunity use the AoR tool to conduct an up-to-date assessment of Canadian conservation area networks (or sample thereof), producing cartographic products to communicate their results. The results of this analysis could be published by the WWF-Canada and distributed nationally. Additionally, potential exists to produce an ESRI Web-App to promote the re-release of the tool.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Python Programming, Cartographic Design using ArcMap/Pro or MapIllustrator, Spatial Analysis with ArcMap/Pro, ESRI web app builder.<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> The project, tool, and products will be able to be showcased by Fleming College; however, the license and rights to the tool will be held by WWF-Canada. Fleming College will not have the rights to distribute the tool itself. A license agreement may need to be signed upon beginning this project.

<b>Project Description:</b> Ottawa Valley Connecting Trails and Tourism<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Renfrew County and the Ottawa Valley are top destinations for ATV'ing in Ontario with well over 600 km of ATV and multi-use trails which include municipal railbeds, crown land, county forestry, county and municipal roads and private landowners. The sport is growing, more and more are looking for online and digital sources for finding and following trails. As the largest County in Ontario in terms of area, and one of the fastest growing ATV clubs in Ontario, we are at a critical point where we are restructuring our entire trail signing and naming system to ensure safety, identify trail technicality ratings, enable ease of access for emergency personnel, include GPS coordinated RV spots and signage, and heritage designation of trails that will connect riders to communities and ATV tourism. We have a series of videos of our trail system, and once our trail system is restructured and signed, we want to be able to have a dynamic website that will allow riders to see determine which trails best suit their riding ability and interest, which services are along that trail for them to plan routes, provide video of what the trail consists of for terrain, include length in time and km to complete a trail, and provide some history and points of interest from the heritage of the land and community. Once the trails are verified digitally, this means an interactive component to our website that can be populated with video, interactive maps, downloadable material and that we can update, maintain and promote. Our demographic on the trails and the technology on the trail has changed. We have more families, seniors, youth and new Canadians and urban riders using the trails with limited experience, more powerful equipment and more reliant on digital devices to remain safe on the trails. Our trails are also multi-use which means walkers, hikers, cyclists, cross-country skiers and dirt bikes would all likely use the platform and benefit from this project. As a not for profit volunteer-run organization we need assistance to map, restructure, and digitize our trail system. RCATV is a member of the Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> An understanding of how to use and take GPS data and digitize it in a format that would be accessible on smartphones and on websites. 
Experience with or ability to update data to a new or use existing app for mobile devices.
Access to or experience with video equipment
Ability to do cartography and mapping
Assistance with graphic design for new physical and downloadable maps
Ability to work in the field to acquire and validate trail data if possible
Ability to research and working with our trails committee subject matter experts on trail marking,<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Environmental Health Map<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> There are close to 1000 food premises in Peterborough City and County. They include, among others, restaurants, supermarkets, butcher shops, and chip trucks as well as cafeterias and kitchens located in churches, daycares and long-term care facilities. The goal of the Peterborough Public Health food safety program is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illness (food poisoning) in Peterborough City and County by routinely inspecting these establishments to ensure their compliance with the Food Premises Regulation, R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 562. We are required to maintain an up to date food safety disclosure system on our website (see link). 
Peterborough Public Health is responsible for the inspection of all public recreational water facilities (pools, spas, wading pools and splash pads) in the City of Peterborough and Peterborough County. Public recreational water facilities are inspected regularly by public health inspectors to prevent and reduce the risk of water borne-illnesses and life-threatening injuries.
Peterborough Public Health also maintains a routine surveillance program for public beaches during summer months to ensure that the water quality is safe for swimming. The water samples are tested for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. A public beach is “posted” when the level of E. coli in the water exceeds a certain limit and is unsafe for recreational use, including human bathing (swimming). When a beach is posted, signage will be placed around the beach area to inform the public. A beach is “closed” when a significant risk to human health and safety has been identified, such as signs of hazardous or infectious material in the water or when there is a blue-green algae bloom. Swimming in the water is NOT permitted when a beach is closed and public access to the beach will be restricted or eliminated.
The purpose of this project is to create a map that outlines where inspected food premises are in Peterborough City and County and links to a data base where the most current inspection report sits (HealthSpace). The map should be versatile enough so that we could expand/adapt the map to include the status of beaches and inspected recreational water facilities in the future<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The students will have to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Peterborough Public Health.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Interactive Neighbourhood Profile Map<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> The goal of the project is to create a visually stimulating Geocortex site, to display Statistics Canada data in a variety of interactive and thematic mapping formats. The viewer would illustrate different demographic variables (e.g. population, household size, age, marital status, ethnic origin, etc.) for various census years (i.e. 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016) by each of the City's neighbourhoods.

The City of Pickering purchased custom profiles of demographic data from Statistics Canada for each of the City’s neighbourhoods. The City is in the process of acquiring 2016 data from Statistics Canada, as well. This data is currently in Statistics Canada's own tabular format (Browser 20/20) which can be imported into Excel. Once the demographic data is imported into Excel, the data will need to be processed and sorted by field and neighbourhood and joined geographic data. This would then be uploaded into a GeoCortex viewer that would be designed to be easy to use by City staff and the public.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> See Systems section. In addition, familiarity with Census data would be an asset.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Necrogeography2.0: Continuing to Map Peterborough’s Little Lake Cemetery<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Little Lake Cemetery is a non-profit and non-denominational cemetery located in the heart of Peterborough, Ontario. It is one of the oldest cemeteries in the area and contains graves spanning a rich history from 1850 to the present. In 2007 a contract worker for the City of Peterborough created a GIS database of cemetery plots containing information such as grave/monument location, family name, condition, oldest death date, material type, and a photo. 

This data had not been updated or maintained until 2016-2017 when 3C Solutions (Previous Fleming Collaborative Project 907-PW) conducted QA/QC work on the data to refine the locational accuracy of the existing points and to correct data inconsistencies. Project deliverables included a corrected geodatabase, a historical spatial analysis, a web application providing cemetery inventory searching, an offline application designed to collect monument point data and a large format map for display in City Hall.

Necrogeography2.0 will continue to build upon the excellent work of 3C Solutions by conducting field work to fill in gaps in the data as well as modifying the existing database to create a more robust and detailed dataset. They will also produce professional graphic outputs such as a marketing brochure and large scale map product.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Strong database skills order to normalize and expand the existing Little Lake Cemetery database. An excellent graphic design background would be ideal to create an attractive and easy to use web application. It would be an interesting project for students with an interest in early Ontario history and a sense of the importance of cultural resource conservation. The student(s) should feel comfortable to tackle this project with a creative and innovative approach, while at the same time maintaining an appropriate degree of respect and integrity regarding the nature of the cemetery information.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Forest Planning Inventory<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> We are beginning to work on a comprehensive Forest Management Plan. This project requires support from a forest inventory database. We have numerous sources of inventory data available, but they are in different formats, containing various pieces of information. We would like to compile these different data sets into a single master dataset which we can use for purposes such as timber harvest planning, identification of high conservation value lands, and growth and yield calculations. The automation of the updating of this and related datasets, or the digitization of data collection, would also be good deliverables.

This project could be mostly completed remotely, but site visits to Haliburton Forest would be good for coordination and the general education of the student(s) in forest management issues.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> I have discussed this project with Storm Robinson. Basic exposure to forest management principles. Good communication and organization skills. Geoprocessing skills (combing multiple overlapping spatial datasets). Design (identifying items of inputs for use in the dataset). Visual design (desigining symbologies for easy representation of complex data, preparing the maps for use in plans and reports) Programming (automation of inputs into an arcmap database from excel or other tabular data).<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Strategies and Approaches for Implementing Long-Term Management, Monitoring and Stewardship Programs for the Haliburton Highlands Land Trust<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Habitat loss and degradation are the greatest threats to biodiversity in Canada today. To mitigate this process in the Haliburton Highlands, the HHLT is acquiring lands of ecological and cultural significance for conservation purposes. It works to select only those properties which clearly have long-term benefit to the public and can be maintained by the land trust in perpetuity.

Through Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Ecological Gifts Program, four properties totaling almost 700 acres have currently been donated to the HHLT. Ecological gifts are made in perpetuity. The HHLT is responsible for the long term management and conservation of ecological gifts and their ecologically sensitive features. To this end the HHLT is required to, and is responsible for, preparing management plans, setting up stewardship programs and initiating and maintaining monitoring programs for each of its properties. 

The HHLT is currently working towards the development and implementation of strategies and approaches that would ensure it can meet its management, monitoring and stewardship responsibilities. 

There are two components to the project:

1. Development of a GIS Spatial Database to Assist in Strategic Planning and Property Stewardship Planning and Management.

The purpose of this project is to develop the mapping and data management tool that will enable the HHLT to build its geospatial database using publically available data from organizations such as various government agencies including Land Information Ontario (LIO), Natural Heritage Database, OMNRF, Ontario Centre for Remote Sensing, local municipalities as well as integrating GIS data (both map and data) currently stored on various consultants databases. This will enable the HHLT to more effectively manage its various properties over a long period of time. 

The GIS database will provide the HHLT with a long term strategic planning tool that will enable it to undertake, proactively, the identification of potentially ecologically significant properties across the Haliburton Highlands. 

Finally, the GIS system will facilitate the ability of the HHLT to communicate, share data and interact with other land management organizations with similar long term land stewardship objectives.

2. The development of spatial data applications and analysis tools using combinations of the various mapping layers and integration of autecological species requirements to assist in the identification of potentially ecologically significant areas and corridor analysis which will help the HHLT to better focus its community education and property acquisition activities across the Haliburton Highlands. These applications will also facilitate the ability of the HHLT to communicate and co-ordinate with adjacent Land Trusts and other conservation organizations responsible for the protection of critical habitat and species of concern.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Students will have a basic knowledge in the use and application of ARC GIS software; understanding of how to build the spatial data layers available through various government and other organizations in Ontario; knowledge of how to develop spatial database applications to facilitate the integration and use of the spatial database layers and species or landscape ecological knowledge;<br>
<b>Project Location:</b> HHLT has proprietary geospatial information on Species at Risk (SAR) which will need to be protected from public scrutiny as part of the project.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Multi-modal transport analysis to demonstrate alternatives to your current commute<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Alternatives to simply driving to work exist, but are often overlooked. This analysis would present a full-range of multi-modal transport options for workers to get to a specific place of work. The software to be used is ArcGIS Network Analyst along with (free) tools to interpret GTFS transit data. The data required is a chosen place of work, the start locations for people making the commute, GTFS data for the chosen transit network, and a transport network that may include but is not limited to: streets, walking paths, transit corridors, cycling paths, trails, pedestrian, etc. Ride sharing and car-pooling options could also be considered. We encourage you to get creative with transport modes!

The commute options could be presented to each worker daily with the best alternative(s) in terms of time, distance, carbon emissions, or any other useful indicator of performance. The end user interaction with this information could be performed using an Esri ArcGIS Online Web Map or an iPhone/Android Smartphone App. This interface could even include live feeds of current locations for other workers with available car-pool space, for example. Again, get creative!

Ultimately, we will result with a workforce for one company that is using smarter options for their daily commute, thus improving traffic, safety, air quality, and overall well being for everyone.<br>

<b>Project Description:</b> Plan A Visit- KTCT<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Development of an trail tourism planning and service year-round map for the- City of Kawartha Lakes to be installed on the KTCT web site (www.ktct.ca). If time permits develop a KTCT app importing this information. Using this as model develop in the future similar trail planning and service maps for Peterborough County and Northumberland County. This project will produce an listing link to web sites that would identify bike, walking/hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing and snowmobile services, food/beverage, lodging and camping and directions and parking within a 2KM distance on both sides of the existing trail. It could also include bike shop rentals and shuttles and transportation. For an example, check out https://gaptrail.org The information will be featured on the KTCT web site, twitter and facebook.

KTCT receives request regularly for this type of information. KTCT response with basic information. If the person was able to "plan" his or her trip on line it would provide them control over what they want to do, increase tourism in the CKL and increase business contact by the trail user.

Presently there is no trail information focused on the services, food and accommodation provided related to travel on the Kawartha Trans Canada Trail in the City of Kawartha Lakes. There is potential to expand this project to include other sections the Trans Canada Trail (Peterborough/Uxbridge) or to use this developed model to provide similar web site contact information anywhere in Canada.

This project will:
allow for potential trail users to plan on-line their visit to the Kawartha Trans Canada Trail. If time permits to develop an App of this information that will allow to be downloaded for free.
In summary, the project requires research, design and include this informatoin on an existing web-GIS based KTCT trail map. The map must have the ability to integrate or link with TCT national, TCT Ontario, local tourism websites. The map/ information will identify and display accommodation, food, services and related support services within 2 km on both sides along the entire KTCT route.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Computer skills and knowledge – web based technology
Organizational Skills – information collection and presentation
GIS application – using existing TCT trail data and apply to location Communication skills – deal with variety of people who will provide and review project information
Strong interest in the project and its benefits to the economic impact for tourism and businesses in CKL
Team that can work independently and meet deadlines<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> 9/27/2017 11:59:27<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Data Collection and Management Solutions for Small Businesses<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Finding a cost effective and efficient means for a small business to accurately (sub meter) collect tree inventory data that is easily manipulated and transferred into mainstream data management software (i.e., Excel) and plotted into design software such as Auto CAD. The key words here are "effective", "efficient", and "cost effective". There are many industry and non-industry related products available on the market. However, when you can't afford (or justify) thousands of dollars for equipment and annually licensing fees, you are left trying to cobble together a process with equipment that isn't 100% compatible (let alone accurate) that requires multiple steps leaving you data vulnerable to corruption. Aghh, can you sense the frustration?!?<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> General GIS knowledge is sufficient. More importantly is the ability to research and recommend a list of affordable, compatible and sustainable products (hardware and software) that will streamline/simplify the process of accurately and efficiently collecting, manipulating and presenting field data. This may require skill sets in database design and/or software customization as well as CAD programming.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Environmental Health Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> There are close to 1000 food premises in Peterborough City and County. They include, among others, restaurants, supermarkets, butcher shops, and chip trucks as well as cafeterias and kitchens located in churches, daycares and long-term care facilities. The goal of the Peterborough Public Health food safety program is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illness (food poisoning) in Peterborough City and County by routinely inspecting these establishments to ensure their compliance with the Food Premises Regulation, R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 562.  We are required to maintain an up to date food safety disclosure system on our website (see link).  
Peterborough Public Health is responsible for the inspection of all public recreational water facilities (pools, spas, wading pools and splash pads) in the City of Peterborough and Peterborough County. Public recreational water facilities are inspected regularly by public health inspectors to prevent and reduce the risk of water borne-illnesses and life-threatening injuries.
Peterborough Public Health also maintains a routine surveillance program for public beaches during summer months to ensure that the water quality is safe for swimming. The water samples are tested for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.   A public beach is ÔÇ£postedÔÇØ when the level of E. coli in the water exceeds a certain limit and is unsafe for recreational use, including human bathing (swimming).  When a beach is posted, signage will be placed around the beach area to inform the public.    A beach is ÔÇ£closedÔÇØ when a significant risk to human health and safety has been identified, such as signs of hazardous or infectious material in the water or when there is a blue-green algae bloom.

<b>Project Name:</b> Township of Selwyn Heritage Property Registry (Phase 1)<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The Township of Selwyn established a Municipal Heritage Committee in 2010 to advise and assist the Township Council on matters relating to the conservation of properties of local heritage value or interest and the establishment and designation of heritage conservation districts. This includes individual structures of historical and/or architectural significance, and the conservation of archaeological resources and cultural landscape features.

Of the many duties undertaken by the Heritage Committee, in 2016 we have begun work on developing and maintaining an inventory of significant heritage buildings, cultural landscapes and cemeteries within the Township. 
There are many heritage features which data needs to be collected so that the Heritage Committee can make other decisions on their ranking of heritage and cultural importance.  The Committee has established criteria to guide its future designations ÔÇô with regard first for properties at risk, then geographic balance throughout the township, a variety of themes and architectural periods to be represented, and then consideration of sitesÔÇÖ potential for tourism, education and interpretation.  

A key step is to have data about specific properties, using relevant historical literature to guide which properties should be initially included in the register.

<b>Project Name:</b> Queries to Report on Headwater Health<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> We seek inquisitive and dedicated GIS students at SSFC to develop and apply queries to generate automatic reports on
select indicators of headwater health in some of south-central OntarioÔÇÖs watersheds. The students will work initially with a
few small catchments in one of five watersheds for which past co-operative projects with Fleming have produced
headwater maps to generate and test the queries, and then hopefully apply them to one or more of the full watersheds. The
five watersheds are the Credit, Grand, Kawartha, Simcoe, and Rouge, as can be seen at
http://ontarioheadwaters.ca/mapping/. Please see Appendix 1 for a more complete description of the OHI and the
importance of headwaters.
We hope that this project will deliver both queries to depict raw conditions, such as how much riparian cover exists along
the sides of streams, and develop a grading system, in conjunction with the OHI, for the conditions calculated by the
queries for combined first and second-order catchments - the key reporting unit for this project.
For example, a query might provide raw data to indicate that a series of streams in a combined first and second-order
catchment might have a minimum of 30 metres of riparian plantings along 90% of both sides of all the watercourses in
that catchment, which might result in a score of A for the catchment. In contrast, the same query might indicate that a set
of streams in a second catchment of first and second order streams has only 15% of its watercourses with 30 metres of
riparian plantings along both of its banks, resulting in a score of F.
The OHI is confident that students at SSFC can develop the queries needed for most if not all of the indicators listed
below, and looks forward to spending time with the students to address a grading system for the combined first and
second-order catchments and if and how they too can be automated.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing       Programming
Database Design/Processing
Spatial/Statistical Analysis        Web Technology (maybe)
Spatial data acquisition/preprocessing
ÔÇó Use existing OHI headwater maps, with datasets produced by past co-op students using data from LIO
Database design/processing
ÔÇó Design and test queries to capture raw data from above datasets.
Spatial/statistical analysis
ÔÇó Run queries on select catchments or sub-watershed and ground-truth the accuracy of outputs from visual
examination of information on existing Google Fusion maps on the OHI website.
ÔÇó Analyze material to be provided by the OHI to develop scoring systems.
Programming
ÔÇó High utilization for queries and possible need to write programs to address grading system, but this may be
beyond skill sets, computer time, or time of project.
Cartographic presentation
ÔÇó None anticipated, but if the programming team sees a classmate who might want to develop icons that can be
clicked upon in order to bring up geodedic data that could emulate an ÔÇ£open governmentÔÇØ approach to reports,
they would be welcome.
Web GIS
ÔÇó Any unexpected new products that can add value to the existing layers on OHMapping, or a demonstration standalone
product on one or more watersheds, is welcome. Should the student team provide any candidate finished
product, the OHI GIS Specialist and Webmistress would perform uploading to our website.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> Review material to be provided by OHI to familiarize Project Team with the concepts of headwaters, combined 1st
and 2nd order catchments, and the OHI construct of Contiguous Upland Headwater Catchments as per Appendix 1.
2. Review list of indicators of interest to the OHI and assess the degree of difficulty in developing queries. The list on
headwater indicators of interest to the OHI for which queries might be helpful includes:
ÔÇó Number of combined 1st and 2nd order catchments in the watershed;
ÔÇó Number of such catchments that are what the OHI calls Contiguous Upland Headwater Catchments;
ÔÇó Percentage of natural heritage cover in each combined 1st and 2nd order catchment;
ÔÇó Length and percentage of 1st and 2nd order catchments in which streams have been straightened ( EG- are straight
for longer than 10 metres) or placed underground; and,
ÔÇó Percentage of streams in a 1st and 2nd order catchment with 30m riparian cover on both sides.

Co-op Project Request Form page 2 of 4
3. Hike a local headwater area with the OHI while discussing progress on queries followed by an initial discussion,
probably in an area coffee shop, on a proposed grading system. For example, a simple grading system for catchments
with varying percentages in natural cover, based on a federal guideline, might be A = 70% and up; B = 50 ÔÇô 70%; C =
40 - 50%; D = 30 - 40%; and F = less than 30%.
4. In conjunction with Fleming faculty, select one of the five watersheds for which OHI headwater mapping exists. EG -
The Rouge is a small watershed, so the queries may run more quickly, but it is also more developed and may not
provide a good test of the queries. Once the team has selected a watershed, develop and test the queries on a set of
catchments or a sub-watershed before running them on a full watershed.
5. Probably a decision point: Discuss with faculty and the OHI if time remaining in the semester is better spent on:
a. Developing and applying the grading system to query date, and/or doing it semi-manually; and/or
b. Running the queries on all or some of the other OHI watersheds.
6. Complete work and write summary report; prepare material for the open house.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Process to Remove Slivers within 10%<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> With the Land Information Ontario updating the current Ontario Hydrological Network (Water), other existing features are now misaligned (admin boundaries, Forest Resource Inventory polygons (polygons of similar forest types), and ownership boundaries) leaving slivers between features.

<b>Project Name:</b> Mapping of urban forest activites<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> This proposed Collaborative Project would contribute to a research initiative lead by the Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto and Tree Canada,  looking to capture and map urban forest activities in Ontario and Nada. The objective of this research is to analyze the distribution of urban forest activities, and correlate them with ecological and social data to identify relationships between these two associated factors. An additional objective is to analyze, map and describe differences in the geographic variation of urban forestry, and conduct a Gap Analysis of urban forestry activities to understand where programs are absent or information gaps exist. 
The GIS / Fleming students would be involved in the preliminary data processing, data preparation to support analysis, to map production and analysis with ArcGIS, to web mapping. The production of maps would be used to assess the state of urban forestry and stewardship activities across Ontario municipalities and communicate this to a broader audience. Later this data will be combined with data from other provinces to have a complete representation of urban forestry activities throughout CanadaÔÇÖs municipalities.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing - Acquiring field data/research/significant manipulation, Database Design and/or Processing - Conceptual &amp; logical data models may be required or developed, Spatial and Statistical Analysis - GIS Analysis, Cartographic Presentation or Visualization - Requires significant cartographic output/visual communication, Web Technology - Requires significant configuration/or programming and online analysis.<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> The final outputs will include the amalgamated and cleaned dataset in Access suitable for analysis and mapping (.mdb), various ArcGIS maps (.mxd and PDFs), analysis outputs (overlay and gap analysis), and an interactive web-map of select data outputs for Ontario Municipalities. A few graphs or PDF communication materials about mapped data could also be prepared, although the final outputs are negotiable based on student time-lines and skillsets.
The .mdb standardized data will be used beyond this project for further analysis, data entry (for rest of Canada), and mapping.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> FOCA Member Google Maps Project<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> FOCA is the Federation of Ontario CottagersÔÇÖ Associations, a not-for-profit organization representing volunteer associations and individual property owners all across Ontario. FOCA has approximately 510 Member Associations. 
Currently FOCA has a Members Map that we would like to build on. Please review the current member map here: https://foca.on.ca/map-of-foca-associations/ 

This map includes the latitude and longitude of where each association is located and the association is marked with a symbol on the map. FOCA intends to build on this map by adding additional layers that will be useful to the organization and its members. 

We hope that this project can take the form of three completed maps using Google Maps. Each map will include the locations of each of our cottage associations with different layers on top of it.

Map #1
This map should include the following layers:
-	The location of each FOCA Member Association
-	 Watershed boundaries in Ontario

Map #2
This map should include the following layers: 
-	The location of each FOCA Member Association
-	Provincial Electoral Riding Boundaries
-	Federal Electoral Boundaries
-	Municipal Boundaries

Map #3
This map should include the following layers:
-	The location of each FOCA Member Association
-	The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Fishery Management Zones
-	Conservation Authority Jurisdictional Boundaries
-	Ontario Land Trust Alliance member boundaries
-	The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Water Management Plan Boundaries
-	Forest Management Plan Areas

FOCA is able to provide the coordinates of FOCA Member Associations required for these maps and will seek out public sources of the other required data.

The current version of Google Maps that FOCA uses cannot handle any kmz file size more than 2MB therefore the student(s) may be required to split the files in to segments in order to keep them below 2MB. Other file types supported by this software are: CSV, TSV, KML, KMZ, GPX, or XLSX file, or a sheet from Google Drive. We will also remain flexible if the student feels it would be more appropriate to represent this data on more than three maps.

FOCAÔÇÖs intention is to use these maps to better serve its members and more effectively direct questions about OntarioÔÇÖs resource management. Having the ability to cross reference where our members are located vs. the different attributes listed above will be extremely useful.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Ghost towns and heritage haunts of The Land Between<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> History teaches us about ourselves; giving us insight into important lessons to be learned, and eluding to our cultural evolution. Due to the limited soils, agricultural production that was typical to European settlers was stifled, and therefore shortly after their immigration to this region, many retreated in frustration leaving more ghost towns here than anywhere in Ontario; furthermore, as industry and development was limited because of the rocky landscape, here the earth fought back and First Nations' cultural perspectives and practices which are based on our relationships with the land were kept relatively intact compared to the rest of southern Ontario. This project aims to combine our existing and new records of ghost towns, built cultural heritage features (graveyards, rail fences etc), and historical and First Nation geo-name places (old named areas) in one database with attributes of descriptors, and where records are spatially geo-referenced, so that too, maps of areas and a mobile app for exploring these sites is generated. Finally statistical/spatial analysis to assess the average distance between sacred cultural places/ghost towns and the current location of villages and/or major roadways/crossroads which will allude to the overall change in our patterns of behaviour and relationships to the natural resources in the region.<br>

<b>Deliverables:</b> These are the three core deliverables of: 1. a database, 2. mapping of ghost towns and cultural sites; and 3. mobile app. for exploring ghost towns and cultural sites in the region using geo-positioning if possible.
4. A fourth deliverable of a statistical/spatial analysis where the average distance of old sacred places and ghost towns will be measured against the current location of villages and major roadways to allude to the overall change in our patterns of behaviour and relationships to the natural resources in the region. This analysis should be accompanied by a basic summary of results in project backgrounder/briefing or within the map itself.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Necrogeography Trinity Anglican Church Cemetery<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Trinity Church was built in 1861 and is one of the oldest fully functioning parishes in the Laurentians to this day. The church cemetery also dates to that period and is located in the small town of Morin Heights about 1 hoursÔÇÖ drive north of Montreal (description of the cemetery and its coordinates are described in chart 1).  The land that the church and the cemetery were built on was donated by the Watchorn family which were pioneers in the local area.

Trinity Church was built of local stone and wood, by early settlers.  Subsequent generations have added to itsÔÇÖ size, comfort and beauty.  Additionally the cemetery has been used for over 90 years by all denominations as well as a corner dedicated to war veterans.  The cemetery contains head stones engraved with names and dates of the earliest families and is considered to be a heritage sight.    

Volunteer parishioners of Trinity Anglican Church manage, maintain and document the burial plots of the cemetery.  However, the record keeping although accurate has become antiquated.  Due to the continuing growth of the cemetery, in part to an aging population, the cemetery has grown to a point in which a more accurate and technologically advanced means of documenting data is required.

At present cemetery plots are entered by hand onto gridded drafting paper making it difficult to read and quickly and accurately research information.  A corresponding excel spreadsheet is maintained, however that is it. The Church itself has a small congregation of very dedicated parishioners. Most of which perform some sort of volunteer function at the church and therefore funds are limited.  Moreover, we lack GIS experience and expertise and would benefit greatly from a student led project that would have a significant positive impact on a small closely knit community.   

The project would include the design of a simple web page with details of Trinity Church and a photo of the church and cemetery.  A link on this web page would bring an authorized user to a web based database with a GIS system for entering data and doing research related to the cemetery.  It is envisaged that all the historical data will be entered into the system, plus the ability to continuously update said database.  It would be preferable if said database was linked to a GIS system that could plot the location and names on a digitized map and that said map could be printed when required.   It would be preferable that the plots be documented with the applicable coordinates (lats and longs) however, if for whatever reason this is not possible a grid square system can be applied.

<b>Project Name:</b> Creation of a TD Friends of the Environment Foundation (FEF) Chapter Boundaries Map<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> TD Friends of the Environment Foundation provides funding to over 1,000 projects each year across the country. The distribution of funds is based on a chapter model where customer-donors donate at their local branch, and each branch is mapped to one of 38 giving chapters. While approximately 1/3 of chapters are aligned along geo-political boundaries, the rest are aligned with TD branch locations with projects applying to the chapter into which their closest branch falls. 
In cases where there is a branch in town, this is relatively straightforward (although we still lack the resources/expertise to produce a map), but for the many projects that fall outside of a community with a branch, the process requires staff to figure out where the project is located, search the closest branch using the TD Branch Locator, and then figure out to which banking district, and therefore which chapter, the project belongs. In order to simplify this process and make it easier for both staff and potential applicants, we need a map that clearly defines chapter boundaries using the GIS-location of branches in the chapters and the delineation of the chapter lines based on the location of branches in adjoining chapters. We would also need to be able to share this map on our website in a user-friendly format, and ideally, integrate it with existing features allowing visitors to choose their chapter (currently text-based) and see examples of funded projects therein.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> : Market Garden planning map and mapping of the educational programming area (The Glen) at Abbey Gardens<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Abbey Gardens Background:

Abbey Gardens is a 300acre property located in the Haliburton Highlands. The site is in the process of being decommissioned as an aggregate operation and is developing incrementally towards becoming a demonstration and education site on issues of food security, biodiversity and ecology. In addition to helping nature reclaim the land, the Abbey Gardens team is dedicated to demonstrating innovative and replicable solutions and practices that will inspire generations of good stewards for our earth and people.

Abbey Gardens is a charitable organization focused on a community-based effort to remediate a decommissioned gravel pit into a sustainable center for innovation.   Our vision is to inspire a healthy community through supporting education, demonstration, and incubation for local food efforts.
Please see attached Programming Information Package for additional details.

Abbey Gardens Market Garden:
.
Two acres of the already recommissioned gravel pit area supports Abbey Gardens market garden, which was first planted in 2010

Abbey GardensÔÇÖ staff operates a 2 acre garden on a partially restored gravel pit which was first planted in 2010.  It is our goal to produce healthy, chemical-free vegetables in a way that integrates with, rather than impacts, the natural environment.  The market garden provides fresh produce that is sold directly through the Food Hub, a modern straw bale sustainable building.  The community kitchen within the Hub is where unsold fresh vegetables are processed into soups, pickles, preserves, jams, baked goods, salads, dips and dressings.  
Future plans exist and are continuously developing as more and more of the decommissioned gravel pit is reclaimed.  A shaded sitting area and hoop houses are dispersed among different types of gardens including hugelbeds, lasagna gardens, pollinator gardens, a labyrinth garden and a young orchard.  These features along with our emerging ÔÇ£Education GardenÔÇØ provide a diverse outside landscape for programming opportunities at Abbey Gardens
The lead gardener is Jim Angus and would be one of the main contacts, along with Irene Heaven and Cara Steele.

Abbey Gardens Natural Programming Area, The Glen:

ÔÇ£The GlenÔÇØ is a 5 acre pocket of natural forested area with a milkweed meadow and a stream running through which is in close proximity to the market garden. This natural program area enhances experiential education   emphasizing our natural environment and its cycles essential for sustainable and healthy living  A developing interpretive trail system further accommodates the growing educational programming at our unique facility. Abbey Gardens strives to make important connections between our natural world and cycles that to us and our food.<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Geographic Network Resource Management Discovery Portal<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Geographic Network Resource Management (GNRM) is the preferred spatial environment at SaskTel for managing our Outside Plant Facilities in a single sophisticated GIS. GNRM also provides access to other data sets such as cadastral data and aerial photography. All data sets managed by GNRM are available for use within the corporation however, we currently do not have a portal for our users to discover this data, nor do we have a standard for maintaining our metadata. We have selected Geoportal Server as our solution.
This project involves customizing a Geoportal web application to serve as an enterprise-wide data discovery portal with the basic functionality to search/browse for metadata and to provide download and link capabilities.

Data Acquisition/Preprocessing Component:

Assess sample datasets and update metadata
Database Component:

Create an Oracle database with sample data to mimic GNRM
Install Geoportal Server and link to the Oracle database
Organize the metadata catalog tree to align with existing data models
Spatial/Programming Component:

Allow the user to perform a spatial query on selected datasets to their area of interest for download
Optional: Allow users to download select data in map viewer by map extent, similar to sample site
Web/Programming Component:

Customize the look and feel of the Geoportal
Allow users to download data, preview data and view full metadata details from the Browse/Search pages, similar to the sample site
Allow users to search and add data to a map viewer similar to the sample site
Add a newsfeed to the home page to provide updates, showcase new or featured webapps/datasets Sample Site: opdgig.dos.ny.gov/#/home<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition and/or Preprocessing, Database Design and/or Processing, Spatial and Statistical Analysis, Programming, Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> A customized Geoportal web application with the required functionality
Fully documented code for maintenance and future additions
Online help for the Geoportal
Outline of methodology and installation manuals if using Geoportal Genie (see Remarks)<br>

<b>Project Name:</b> Necrogeography: Mapping Peterborough's Little Lake Cemetery<br>
<b>Project Description:</b> Little Lake Cemetery is a non-profit and non-denominational cemetery located in the heart of Peterborough, Ontario. It is one of the oldest cemeteries in the area and contains graves spanning a rich history from 1850 to the present. In 2007 a contract worker for the City of Peterborough created a GIS database of cemetery plots containing information such as grave/monument location, family name, condition, oldest death date, material, and a photo. This data has not been maintained or seen by a wide audience. The main goal of this project is to create an easy to use web mapping application for the public to search and view the Little Lake Cemetery data and for City Staff to maintain it. Time permitting, the students can perform some analysis relating the graves to spatial and temporal factors.<br>
<b>Project Requirements:</b> Data Acquisition/Preprocessing        Programming
Cartographic Presentation
Spatial/Statistical Analysis        Web Technology<br>
<b>Deliverables:</b> 1) Create an offline application to collect, store and edit attributes of the headstones 
ÔÇó        Example Attributes: Family Name, Death Date, Monument type, Monument Condition, Primary and Secondary Materials, Associated Features.

2) Interactive Web Map of Little Lake Cemetery
ÔÇó        Ability to click on plots and have pop-ups with attribute information and linked images displayed.
ÔÇó        Change basemap layers.
ÔÇó        Search, Query and Filter by Family Name, by Death Date, by OGS (Ontario Genealogical Society) Reference Number), Little Lake Cemetery ID.

3) Spatial/Historical Analysis of Little Lake Cemetery Data (time permitting)
ÔÇó        Analysis of type of stone and condition in relation to environmental factors such as trees, elevation, proximity to water, etc. 
ÔÇó        Time analysis: whether spikes in mortality rates as evidenced in death dates are related to events in history (Spanish Flu, Tuberculosis/typhoid issues)
ÔÇó        Find and identify graves that may have been moved from the CityÔÇÖs first burial grounds. 

4) An ESRI geodatabase containing all feature datasets and feature classes associated with the mapping of the Little   Lake Cemetery.     

5) Digital cartographic products for wall display in municipal offices.  Maps should be comprehensive, clear, informative and be of excellent design quality. Maps can be printed at City of Peterborough Geomatics/Mapping office.<br>
