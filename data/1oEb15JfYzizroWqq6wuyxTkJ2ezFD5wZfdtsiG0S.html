<b>Topography:</b> Patehara range can be said to be the most fertile of all forest range in Mirzapur. The main reason is because the forest range is encircled with two major rivers-Belan and Bakahar, both having their own natural history and known for rich aquatic biodiversity. Meja Dam and Sirsi Dam are among the biggest dams in Mirzapur and are constructed on River Belan and Bakahar respectively. Most of the areas alongside the rivers and reservoirs are under cultivation. In some stretches, there are mountains alongside rivers giving an appearance of gorge or canyon like topography. Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary lies on the western side of Patehara forest range and is continuous with it. Sirsi fall is a major tourist attraction which is on river Bakahar. However, the main water fall area is closed for tourists due to several accidents happened in past where people died after being attacked by honey bees and felling into the river.<br>
<b>Seasonal Water Sources:</b> River Bakahar, River Belan<br>

<b>Topography:</b> Forests of Dramadganj range are at higher elevation than other forest ranges of Mirzapur. Dense old growth can be observed in this mountainous forest range.
The western boundary of Kaimur WLS touches the Dramadganj Forest Range. There are numerous agricultural fields in foothills, but phenomenon of landscape change is not fast as other forest range. The main reason for comparatively better density of forests may be attributed to the steep slopes and higher
mountains in this range. At several places, we found remnants of small-scale mining activities. These forests are mostly inhabited by tribal people. Their livelihood is highly dependent on forest resources and some of the old gardens of Mahua can be seen in this range. Halia range, which falls under protected area-Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary is continuous with Dramadganj forest range. The elevation varies between approx. 175-400 m in this forest range.<br>
<b>Seasonal Water Sources:</b> River Adhwa, River Sewati<br>

<b>Topography:</b> This landscape has short to medium height hills, with less steep slopes. The elevation varies between 170-250 meters. Though the sub-surface layer is rocky sandstone, but soil layer is still found intact in most places. Dense canopy can be seen in most of the hills. In some pockets, old growth forests are also found. Most of the plain areas in between the hills were found to be degraded/mixed deciduous forests interspersed with grasslands and scrub forests dominated by Zizyphus, Acacia catechu and bamboo. Hyptis suaveolens (bantulsi/bush mint) invasion is very common in this forest range.<br>

<b>Topography:</b> Chunar and Sukrit are two different forest ranges but in continuous with each other. Chunar range starts from the south of River Ganges and extends till Wyndhamfall, Marihan and Sukrit range. Siddhanath Dari is one of the famous religious waterfall which falls under Chunar range. The elevation of the forest areas varies between 200-300 m.

Sukrit: A significant portion of Sukrit forest range is inaccessible, and those accessible are highly disturbed with human interference. Some portions of Sukrit range are severely invaded by Lantana camara, especially the areas near the mining stretch. Canopy cover increases while we move inside 6-7 km from SH-5A. Bamboo is highly dominant in foothills. Some patches of the forests were found to be pristine with good diversity of trees such as Chiraunji, Kutaja, Mahua etc.

Chunar: Chunar range is severely degraded near its periphery towards Ganga. These denuded hills and fragmented patches of forests are interspersed with number of small active and abandoned mines of approx. 20-50 meters in radius. Most of the Chunar range gave appearance of scrub forests and soil layer severely compacted. Some dense canopy with fairly good soil layer could be observed in Sakteshgarh beat, where sloth bears are also reported<br>
