<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I successfully lead the effort for Erie County government to join other counties from across Pennsylvania in adopting a resolution in support of a citizens Commission for Legislative Redistricting and Congressional Reapportionment in 2016, and attempted on multiple occasions in getting it adopted as part of the CCAP platform.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. While on County Council I was successful in moving Erie forward in joining a coalition of other counties statewide who support an independent, bipartisan redistricting commission. See Resolution Number 39, 2016.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Absolutely.  Politics will never be completely removed from the process, but as a legislator I believe I have an obligation under our democracy to ensure that every vote counts and that all parties are playing on a level playing field.  On the federal level, the previous redistricting invalidated by our state Supreme Court, had cut Erie County into two different districts thereby emaciating our representation on the federal level.  The next challenge is to bring fairness to the state legislative redistricting structure to ensure that the majority of Pennsylvania's voters voices, statewide, and locally, are heard.  I firmly believe that these goals can only be accomplished with an independent citizens' commission.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> In order to achieve any of my priorities, we must end the practice of gerrymandering. The process undercuts democracy and subverts the legislative process, blocking meaningful progress on issues important to our citizens. The disfunction in our state and federal government frustrates voters; and their dissatisfaction fuels cynicism that often leads people to give up on our democracy. This is a tragic outcome that we cannot allow to continue. I fully support an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, as proposed by the League of Women Voters and Fair Districts PA.<br>

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I believe we must end the practice of gerrymandering. The process undercuts democracy and is the reason for the inability of our legislative process to make any meaningful progress on issues important to our citizens. The disfunction in our state and federal government frustrates voters, and their dissatisfaction fuels cynicism that often leads to apathy or a choice to no longer participate in our democracy by voting. This is a tragic outcome that we cannot allow to continue. I fully support an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, as proposed by the League of Women Voters and Fair Districts PA. I would vote for HB722 and work to bring it to a full house vote as soon as possible.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I support reforming our congressional and legislative redistricting process to implement an independent citizen's redistricting commission. I feel that taking redistricting out of the hands of politicians would be the best. I feel that an AI software system should be created to establish the pattern, combining a grid system (longitude and latitude) with certain elements of community layout and population would be the best method.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support moving to a citizen's commission for legislative redistricting.  I recently hosted a series of eight town hall meetings where I addressed the issues surrounding gerrymandering in detail.  Many have said that it is a conflict of interest for legislators to draw legislative districts, and I agree.  In a similar vein, I have introduced legislation that would put all decisions regarding legislator's compensation in the hands of a citizen's commission.  Everyday citizens are increasingly skeptical of government in general and legislators in particular.  Instituting these reforms would go a long way to restoring public confidence in the legislative process.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> With Pennsylvania ranking third worst in the nation for the fairness of its electoral boundaries, I understand the frustrations of voters who see their rights being infringed upon by backroom political maneuvering. I was proud to Co-Sponsor HB 722 because accountable and transparent government is a fundamental right, not a privilege. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> As an elected official, I firmly believe in placing people above politics. Grandstanding for the sake of political expediency is unbecoming of anyone seeking a career in public service. I wholeheartedly support fair districts and the necessary measures to implement them because people deserve to know that their votes actually count for something. Fair districts hold elected officials accountable, promote governmental transparency, and take the needless political maneuvering out of the process. True public servants should embrace districts free of gerrymandering because it will force candidates to run on their record, vision, and character.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. For too long legislators have used voting rights and our democracy as a bargaining chip to serve their own interests. We experienced that last time both Republican and Democratic legislators voted in favor of a 2011 Congressional map which is arguable one of the most unfair maps drawn in modern day history, which Representative D. Costa voted in favor of*.  I support an independent council, which would attempt to remove politics from drawing a fair district map. We must ensure that it is comprised of members who are representative of the state of Pennsylvania and remain free from political influence.   Source: House Votes for SB 1249 (12/20/2011)

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I have co-sponsored legislation supporting a citizen's redistricting commission for Pennsylvania. I am delighted by the energy around voting reform, and would like to see a broader community dialogue addressing questions of what Pennsylvanians believe would constitute "fair" districts, a word absent from our constitution but very present in the minds of reformers.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Definitely. As co chair of Reaolutions committee for Fair Districts Pa Pittsburgh I am on the front lines.I fight for this because I believe that all our districts on every level should be drawn by independent commissions remove from party Partisanship which allows both parties to select the people who elect them rather than the people choosing who best represents them.History has proven that this tainted system has fatally failed the people and is a stain on our Democracy .I believe that the people truly want districts that are drawn fairly to give them proper representation.Thats why I continue to fight with our partners to pass Sb22 and House bill 722 which will appoint an independent commissions to draw our districts.Unfortunatly because Democrats feel its their turn to Draw the lines many  are not pushing this issue although the majority of the Constituents support this issue. I support the issue of fair and equitable redestricting done by an independent commission.NOW!!

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I would love to see Legislative district lines drawn that do not represent a partisan advantage. I believe we need to have primaries that are open to ALL voters. There should be no restrictions on a voters choice. I am facing this with my own family and friends.  Although they are registered Republicans, they support me, but unfortunately cannot vote for me in the primary.  Along with redrawing fair maps, we must also look at our antiquated system for the voters.      If elected, my priority is to put my constituents priorities above political party.  When our Legislature cannot work together, they put Pennsylvania at a huge disadvantage.  I do feel that the voters are now seeing the importance of their voice in the political process.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> The very first thing I did, when I recognized I needed to become far more active in our political process, even before I decided to run for office, is to attend a Fair Districts meeting, where Carol Kuniholm spoke.  Understanding gerrymandering, and the ways in which our districts are drawn, was when I started to get a sense of just how much work there is to be done to ensure that our democracy functions as it's intended.  I truly believe that without a fair, non-partisan districting process, we can never have a true democracy.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support reforming our redistricting process by creating a non-partisan, independent commission to guarantee that legislative and congressional districts are drawn in a fair, non-partisan manner. It is clear the process is broken, which is why the Pennsylvania Supreme Court nullified the badly gerrymandered congressional districts we previously had. It is vital to our democracy that citizens get to choose their elected representatives, rather than have politicians in back rooms choose their voters to gain a partisan advantage.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I would support any method that does not involve legislators picking their voters, rather than voters picking their legislators.  This particular idea certainly seems promising; whether I could support it or not would depend on the particulars.  Any method that involves politicians making appointments to a commission is bound to become political, no matter what type of person gets appointed.  I would ideally like to see the members of the commission randomized, or districting to be computer-aided in a way that guarantees the simplest possible borders of districts while complying with federal regulations regarding minority representation and considering communities of interest.  The most important thing is to work as hard as possible to achieve FAIR districts.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. As it stands, gerrymandering ensures Republican control of the state and national legislatures even when Democrats win a substantial majority of the votes. But the solutions is not a partisan Democratic alternative. For the health of our democracy, we must ensure that the voting populace has meaningful choices and a chance to allow their voices to be heard at every election opportunity - and the only way to ensure that in the long term is through an accountable, transparent, and citizen controlled redistricting process that prioritizes amplifying the power of democracy over the continued dominance of one party over another.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. When politicians don't have to listen to their voters, we get what we have today: gridlock, hyperpartisanship, and an ineffective legislature. It's frustrating that representatives in Harrisburg listen more to the wants of Harrisburg lobbyists than to the needs of working families like mine. Gerrymandering removes political accountability, and it's time for that to change because elected representatives should work for their communities, not their donors. I strongly support Fair Districts PA's legislation to end political gerrymandering once and for all, and an independent citizen's redistricting commission is necessary to stop both Republicans and Democrats from enacting partisan gerrymanders. An independent commission that draws our legislative and congressional districts through a nonpartisan, transparent process will make sure that every vote counts, not just those of megadonors and party leaders.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Absolutely. Specifically, I would look to Arizona as the prime model for how to setup such a system. Even among states with independent commissions, Arizona is fairly unique. Not only does Arizona require the commission to make districts that are compact and compliant with the voting rights act, it also requires the commission, when possible, to make as many competitive districts as possible. This is in contrast to California's system which expressly prohibits considering any partisan data. However, I believe creating competitive districts should be a goal for a commission. The three swing districts that Arizona's latest commission drew all have representatives that are among the most moderate in their party. Also, competitive districts force the representatives to stay close to his/her community; to work hard to maintain their support. This helps move politicians away from being a party member and towards being a true representative for his/her district.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> While there are certainly reforms that can be made to the redistricting process to ensure a more transparent process and better outcome, we must be wary of making changes for the wrong reasons.  Far too often, those complaining about redistricting are special interests (from both sides) who did not get what they want.  Providing additional independent oversight, expanded citizen input, and more can achieve many of the goals we all share without turning away from a process simply to answer the complaints of special interests.

I am a cosponsor of House Bill 722, which would create an independent redistricting commission and would represent a significant step toward reducing partisan gerrymandering.  Voters should choose their representatives, rather than politicians choose their voters.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do. Gerrymandering has effectively disenfranchised millions of people across this country, whose votes have been thoroughly neutered through "creative" districting.  While the lawsuit that resulted in the new Congressional districts is certainly progress, we have not solved the fundamental issue. The next redistricting, if it proceeds along the same lines as the old, will create the same problems. On top of this, the lawsuit has not fixed our legislative districts. My district, for example, is conspicuously drawn to exclude black voters in Hazelwood - who are lumped in with residents of the Hill District, the North Side, and the Hilltop.  Gerrymandering is not simply a partisan issue. It disenfranchises voters in primary and general elections alike, all for the same purpose: incumbency protection. I am not interested in helping incumbents avoid competitive elections, and I fully support redistricting reform

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am opposed to changing to a citizen�s redistricting commission.  Currently, the pa house is structured to have small districts that are intended to reflect the makeup of our commonwealth electorate.  The responsibility should fall on those we elect, pursuant to the laws in place.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Accountable leadership elevates people above partisan politics. Sadly, the legislature has fallen woefully short of this expected standard. The grandstanding, juvenile behavior, and profligate spending that accompany the defense of partisan gerrymandering are beyond sinister. Pennsylvanians have the right to choose their representatives, not the other way around. The implementation of an independent redistricting commission will hold elected officials accountable, forcing them to be evaluated on their accomplishments, rather than how well they can manipulate lines on a map.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> The United States boasts a proud tradition of combating injustice and defending the central tenets of democratic ideals. I doubt the framers envisioned a system in which politicians and their special interest allies so openly flouted basic rights in favor of partisan gerrymandering. Elections are to be free and fair, without concerted efforts to model districts after constellations. I support implementing the independent commission and will challenge any elected official who doesn�t.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> In terms of the redistricting process for Congressional and legislative districts, I support the current process where the duly elected PA General Assembly approves the districts as set forth by the PA Constitution.  I do not believe the State Supreme Court has the authority to draw Congressional maps as it recently did.  Additionally, an independent citizen's commission would most assuredly be populated by people appointed by the political body, some by the majority party and some by the minority party.  I believe this proposed commission would then be as partisan as the political body which appoints them.  In the current system, the majority party does the redistricting.  They receive their mandate from the voters, which is as it should be.  I would not usurp that mandate by replacing it with unelected bureaucrats, unanswerable to the voters.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Partisan gerrymandering not only flouts the spirit of fair and free elections, but also fundamental constitutional rights. Diluting votes through insidious cartography violates a voter’s right to have their voice weighted equally relative to other voters. Contravening both equal protection and free speech rights is all the more insulting when the party in power espouses unbridled constitutional reverence. The legislature has failed miserably in defending our democracy. It is imperative to immediately implement a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission to rectify the failures of Mike Turzai and his sycophants.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Leadership in Harrisburg has proven itself beyond ineffectual when it comes to providing voters with equitable districts. If those tasked with crafting nonpartisan maps cannot deliver, it is essential to implement an independent commission to reaffirm confidence in our democracy. I will work with groups such as Fair Districts PA to help guarantee that the redistricting process is both transparent and adheres to Constitutional requirements.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I favor an independent citizen�s redistricting commission in Pennsylvania for both congressional and legislative districts. It�s time to take partisan politics out of the redistricting process and restore the principle of one person, one vote. When sitting legislators draw district maps, it�s the politicians who benefit, not the voters. Legislators choose their voters instead of voters choosing representatives, which is wrong, regardless of the party in power. Elections cease to be competitive. Poor representation leaves people feeling their voices aren�t heard and sows voter apathy and government gridlock. Several other states have established non-partisan citizen commissions and seen positive results: greater transparency in the redistricting process, more voter trust, and increased public acceptance of district maps. 80% of Pennsylvanians across the political spectrum support redistricting reform. A citizen�s redistricting commission would be fairer than our current system.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Redistricting isn�t just a local problem or even a state problem, but an issue that is receiving national attention�for too long and on both sides of the aisle there has been irresponsible redistricting. While I�m not certain that a citizen commission wouldn�t eventually be corrupted by the same partisan motivation, I�m for a fair and equitable process, working with other elected officials (irrespective of party affiliation) and for keeping this vital responsibility in the hands of legislature and out of the hands of activist judges.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do support the implementation of an independent citizen�s redistricting commission.  The practice of gerrymandering is detrimental to our democracy as it allows elected officials to choose their voters rather than voters choosing their elected officials.  Gerrymandering has also created an environment where elected officials �feel safe� which may lead them to be less responsive to all of their constituents and the issues they care about.  Bipartisan bills proposing an independent, citizens commission have already been introduced in the PA House and Senate and I hope our current elected officials take the necessary steps to move these bills forward.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> A Citizen's Commission to draw district lines for both houses of the state legislature is a fair non-partisan method.  Elections, not based on gerrymandered districts, are the basis of our democracy.  Politicians of both parties are capable of drawing district lines to favor their parties.  Keep politics out of redistricting efforts.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> An independent commission to draw state and federal legislative districts is the way to go.  The old Congressional maps which were just re-drawn in PA allowed the Republican Party to have a 13-5 advantage in legislators, but the population did not reflect that proportion.  If you look at Maryland, gerrymandering by the Democrats also recently produced a skewered result.  The only way to draw districts is to remove the process from politics as much as possible.  No current politicians should be part of the process. FairDistrictsPA has a workable plan.  They want to appoint an impartial, independent citizens commission to draw legislative districts.  They would need to amend the PA Constitution. Bills supporting this new commission would have to pass both the PA House and the PA Senate for two years in a row and then the vote would be put to a state-wide referendum.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I would support  an impartial citizen's redistricting commission. The method laid out by Fair Districts PA suggests 11 members would be chosen. 4 from each of the major parties and three members that are unaffiliated with the major parties would sit on the commission. These members must not have served in a political office or run for office or have a spouse who has served or run in the previous 5 years.. These members would work from a database that does not define party. The Secretary of State of the Commonwealth does background checks on commission applicants and makes sure that they are represented by diversity.This seems like a fair way to redistrict that removes politics from the process.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> When aiming to highlight Harrisburg’s thriving dysfunction, look no further than the redistricting debacle. Politicians devote more energy to defending unconstitutional Congressional maps than they do to providing constituent services. Ordinary Pennsylvanians are rightfully outraged at the flippancy demonstrated by elected officials in rectifying this injustice. An independent commission is the solution most likely to yield a result that adheres to fundamental constitutional tenets. Not only will districts be equitable and reflect the actual interests of like communities, nonpartisan maps will hold Congressional Representatives accountable and force them to earn re-election through effective job performance. They work for us, not the other way around.<br>

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I fully support the implementation of an independent citizen's commission to create a fair and unbiased redistricting commission.  Drawing congressional and legislative districts must be free from the influence of elected officials.  Only by allowing people to choose their officials, and not allowing legislators to choose their voters, can we have a truly fair and impartial system.  Geographically contiguous and similarly populated districts are needed to insure that any single party has a built in advantage in the electoral process.

Politics has become very polarized and to make sure that districts are fair and even they should be drawn by an independent commission.

The new districts were not drawn by the legislator and these new districts are fair to the citizens of the Commonwealth.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I believe Gerrymandering is one of the most important issues to solve for Pennsylvania if we want to have actual progress in our legislature. I support HB 722 and SB 722 fully because both bills would create a fair way to redistrict PA. Redistricting is inevitable, so it is imperative that when it does happen, we create an independent citizens commission to do the process. This ensures more fairness and transparency to the redistricting process. 

I have also had several discussions about gerrymandering with Bill Marx of Delmont City Council, who introduced me to Fair Districts PA.  Since then, I have been a big fan of the organization, and I hand out Fair Districts literature when I register people to vote !<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support reforming the redistricting process by implementing an independent commission. My district is an obvious victim of gerrymandering, and the outcome of this is more partisan politics. Partisan politics leads into heavy division and thus no progress is made in the legislature. Neither side is willing to compromise or agree, and ultimately the American people pay the price. Compromise is said to be the essence of democracy, but unfortunately compromise is non-existent in our current political system. One of the reasons I am running is to bridge the divide between our heavily divided country. As a newcomer to politics, I hope to provide fresh perspective to the PA legislature.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Pennsylvania congressional and legislative district lines are drawn by two different processes.  Both have elected official committee representation. The legislative committee is comprised of House majority and minority leaders, Senate majority and minority leaders and an independent chair, who does not hold public office.  The congressional redistricting is worked on by State Government Committees in both House and Senate, majority and minority representation. Both congressional and legislative redistricting have public hearings.  The congressional lines are approved by the governor. The legislative lines are approved by the State Supreme Court.  In spite of recent publicity over congressional redistricting, I see no reason to change the processes.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes I would support legislation to develop an independent citizen's redistricting commission. With the recent events of gerrymandering, I feel that the district lines should be in the hands of the citizens, not the hands of the majority party.  A bipartisan map is difficult to draw when its is done with opinionated views. Certain lines will always be drawn to favor the party in power.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> YES- Unfortunately I feel it would be highly challenging to actually identify &quot;independent citizens&quot; to serve on such a panel while also having the intelligence and expertise to calculate the data and determine non-bias districts. Government advisers would then recommend consultants and the system will result in the same disjointed bias.  Another option could be to require a 2/3 approval in the house &amp; senate before reaching the Governors desk.  Either way, Bi-partisan Legislature or Citizen Panel, Parameters and priorities for determining borders should published and transparent; panel members should serve a rotating term, citizens would need to be properly vetted and a checks and balance system still would need to be in place to challenge and appeal their work.

This just happened in my Congressional District and now the person who won, will not represent the district he ran for; due tof this unfair practice.  No particular party should have the advantage.  Government was designed to be for the people and by the people, therefore it should be removed from those who have the Majority.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am willing to discuss and debate better ways of doing Congressional redistricting, but I am not willing to support HB 722--a bill I think would make the process more secretive, less accountable and more partisan behind closed doors. The participants are selected by the Secretary of State--an unelected official. I also have the good fortune of representing thoughtful voters who regularly split their tickets and usually do not vote the "party line," either party line, so i don't buy the argument that anybody has been disenfranchised by the old maps--odd as they were.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do support redistricting reform. The citizens of Pennsylvania deserve fair representation, regardless of political affiliation. When politicians are entered into the redistricting process, political bias distorts the maps. Therefore, I believe that an independent citizen's redistricting commission can help to solve this issue. We need to fight to ensure that our maps are enacted to accurately represent our citizens, not the politicians who drew them.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I was running for Congress in the old PA 5 when the new maps came out. Then Rep. Cris Dush proposed to impeach 4 of our Justices. I switched gears to run against him. His efforts to thwart the independent redistricing commission are relentless and uninformed. I am grateful for all that Fair Districts PA has done to bring this issue to the attention of the public. I am going to keep fighting to win this seat and be one more vote for Fair Districts in Pennsylvania.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I enthusiastically support an independent citizens redistricting commission to replace the current system of congressional and legislative redistricting. Citizens should be choosing their representatives; representatives should not be choosing their constituents. As a former Congressional candidate I ran for office in a 16 county district that stretched from Erie to Huntingdon County. Five of the counties were split and this allowed the sitting members to practically ignore the constituents and their needs. I am confident that an independent redistricting commission would result in fairer and less manipulated maps which would hopefully create more hard fought races. Hard fought races result in better representation of citizens and that should be our goal in the long run.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support HB 722, the Fair Districts bill. We need to take the drawing of the state�s congressional districts out of the hands of politicians and put it into the citizens� hands. I support Fair Districts in their push to create an independent, bipartisan commission to redraw our districts. �Voters should select their representatives, not the other way around.� No political party should be able to change the rules or the map. If you cannot win in a fair fight, step out of the ring.

During today's political culture independent commissions seem to operate with a political agenda in mind. The map drawn by the PA Supreme Court splits Johnstown, PA in half compromising two congressional districts; possibly to penalize to my areas vote in the 2016 Presidential election.

The people vote for each candidate to represent them in that body and it is their responsibility to accomplish the tasks required of them by the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes.  Independent citizens should be part of the redistricting process to ensure fair and equal elections.  Recent redistricting and successful court challenges here in Pennsylvania show that redistricting by elected officials leads to gerrymandering that is not fair to voters.  An independent citizen's redistricting commission should be transparent, impartial and accountable - leading to fairer districts and better representation of constituents at all levels of government.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. I introduced a bill that would create a Congressional Redistricting Commission and provide guidelines for the congressional redistricting process. By amending the Pennsylvania Election Code, H.B. 2020, the Congressional Redistricting Commission would be established each year following a decennial census, as well as require the commission to adhere to redistricting principles created by state and federal law and court precedents.  The intent of my bill is to put integrity back into the process of redistricting and to insure that congressional districts are drawn by considering the fair and equal representation of the citizens of Pennsylvania rather than the political parties currently drawing maps.  I also applaud the Supreme Court�s decision regarding the 2011 Congressional redistricting plan. This decision underscores the need for Congressional redistricting reform. The political interests of incumbents should not come before the interests of the Pennsylvania electorate.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. We need to reduce the influence of professional politicians and partisanship in the drawing of voting districts, which has in the past led to gerrymandering and disenfranchisement of voters.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I strongly support HB 722 and believe that what the Republicans in the State Government committee did to the bill is atrocious.  The current Rep in my district, Judy Ward, sits on that committee and is complicit.  If I were not running for office I would probably be more involved directly with Fair Districts.  I am happy to say that a member of my Indivisible, Steve Elfelt, has become actively involved in publicizing and lobbying on behalf of Fair Districts here in Blair County.  Gerrymandering has been a problem for decades in various forms and it is well past time to eliminate it.  I will support any measure that ensures a non-partisan and fair way of drawing our districts.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am a strong supporter of creating the independent citizen�s redistricting commission because I believe that gerrymandering weakens our democracy.  With our current partisan system for redistricting our ability to hold our elected officials accountable is impaired.  Fair districts ensure that the true will of the majority of voters is reflected in the person who is elected.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I have read and researched this effort and support efforts to give all Pennsylvanians fair representation.  I have spoken with the local representative from Fair District and have indicated a willingness to listen to learn how this effort will not include a political influence from outside forces.
There are critics of this group and supporters and I look forward to a informative meeting to learn more.  
I'm in favor of working together with all stakeholders to come up with the most fair solution.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am in favor of redistricting reform that eliminates political influence.  I am wary that a proposal exists currently that can eliminate political influence completely.  The courts should not be involved in redistricting.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> While I think Gerrymandering favors the political party's over the people, it is still the responsibility of the legislature, not the courts. I am opposed to what recently happened with the Pennsylvania redistricting map through the courts, but would support an Independent Citizens Commission if it were the result of a legislative action to establish it, and not something derived from the courts.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, while I oppose what has just happened to Pennsylvania's legislative redistricting by the courts, I do believe gerrymandering has been used by both parties for decades to manipulate our voting districts with little if any thought given to the constituents who they represent. Perhaps putting this process into the hands of those very people who have been disenfranchised by it, would be a good solution. However I would have to see the details of that commission before I would sign off on it.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes I support an independent Citizen's group to do the redistricting. This would ensure that a group comprised of nonpoliticians will work in an open and transparent manner to draw the new maps. It would eliminate voters� political affiliations and past election results in the development of the new maps. The extreme partisan gerrymandering has created has created deep political divisions in our state and the country. When whichever party is in power they draw the maps to their advantage which makes compromise hard to achieve. The elected officials will be more willing to reach across the aisle and work for the people if they know their position depends on it.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Redistricting is the drawing of political boundaries making it inherently political. Creating an �independent commission� comprised of voters belonging to political parties won't make the process less political. Much like has happened with the Supreme Court's process, the party making the appointments to the commission will control the bias of the commission.  One could actually argue that since this commission wouldn�t be answerable to the voters it becomes a political bureaucracy with even less accountability to the will of the people.  The 2011Congressional Map created by Senate Bill 1249 of 2011 and overturned by the PA Supreme Court, even with a Republican majority, needed bipartisan support in the State House to become law, an important fact ignored by special interest groups funding the initiative to change the process. Any discussion of change must include great caution in an effort to keep from making the process worse than some already consider it to be.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> The redistricting process is flawed - a process driven by partisan politics, mapping technology, big data, and outside money. The result is gerrymandering: the practice of manipulating voting districts to benefit parties, not people. Gerrymandered districts give voters less voice and less choice, and we get polarization instead of problem-solving in Harrisburg and Washington.  I support an independent citizen's redistricting commission because it would ensure a capable and demographically representative commission, provide multiple safeguards for a fairer process, and reduce the major political parties� ability to manipulate district lines.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I absolutely support reforming our congressional and legislative redistricting process. An independent citizen's redistricting commission seems to be the best option at this time. Every vote must count equally. Manipulating District lines to ensure a certain outcome always disadvantages certain voters.This degrades our democratic society by dissuading people from voting since they begin to feel their vote just doesn't count. Politics must be removed from the redistricting process as much as possible.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I have been very impressed with the work of groups like Fair Districts PA who are drawing attention to our outdated, unfair map-drawing procedures. I look forward to co-sponsoring legislation to implement a nonpartisan citizens commission for redistricting.

I think we can all agree that the tone in Washington is permeating our state legislature, as well. Where are the town halls? Why are bills being held in committee for months on end, especially when there is a large public consensus on the issue? 

If I'm elected, I want to be held accountable to my constituents and the people of Pennsylvania. I want to have town halls. I want people to schedule meetings with me, especially if they are on the opposite side of an issue. We should not be afraid of discourse, we should embrace it. I believe we can solve the major issues we are facing as a state without compromising our values.

Do you?<br>

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> letter published in newspaper but not currently on line.  It follows: I am astonished but not surprised to hear Congressman Scott Perry and State Representative Stan Saylor decry the newly redrawn congressional district maps.  Sure, up until now York County has been fortunate to be in one congressional district and that change will require some adjustment. Other counties in Pennsylvania have been divided for many decades so we can do it too.   Instead, the focus should be on the previous maps which permitted Pennsylvania Republican leaders to design lines favoring them rather than making them more competitive.   Isn't true political competition what our democracy is all about?   We should support efforts to enhance the healthy exchange of ideas rather than stacking the deck to favor one party or the other.   Politicians should vie for the average moderate voter like you and me.   That might force them to come out of their ideological corners and meet in the middle where compromise and progress can be made.    

We need to take this decision one step further by permanently instituting the change needed to completely remove district design from politicians of either party.  As a member of the state house, Saylor should push bipartisan legislation like HB 722 to set up an independent commission so that we won't have to go through this again after the 2020 census.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I have been a vocal supporter of the original HB 722 and of an independent citizen’s commission to draw our boundaries for fair elections and responsive government.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I very strongly support an independent citizen's commission in Pennsylvania. A commission made up of citizens neutralizes the partisanship we see in our current system and gives residents of the Commonwealth a legislature that is more responsive to their needs instead of to political power struggles. When Republicans draw the maps, the maps favor Republicans; when Democrats draw the maps, the maps favor Democrats; when citizens draw the maps, the maps favor the citizens. This is definitely a problem we can solve if we have the will to do so.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> In the constitution it clearly states that congressional and legislative district lines are to be drawn by the legislators. Every ten years a censuses is conducted followed by drawing new lines based on population shifts. The committee of legislators that is established to draw new lines is made up of both Republicans and Democrats. The current system is bipartisan and balanced. The way the system works now brings together conservative and liberal views into realigning. An independent citizens group may or may not be made up of both Republicans and Democrats. Those that believe the system has been gerrymandered have seen the lines going from legislator gerrymandering to judge gerrymandering. Is independent citizen gerrymandering next?

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do support redistricting reforms to ensure that both Legislative and Congressional districts are as compact as possible and split as few counties and municipalities as possible.  Municipalities are better off when they have strong advocates in the State House and in Congress.  And multiple representatives tends to dilute that relationship.  I will work for the adoption of laws and internal House rules to reduce those splits and ensure compactness of districts.  However, I do not support initiatives to create commissions to redraw districts.  I support a system whereby Congressional reapportionment is accomplished in the same way that state laws are passed -- by the elected state Legislature in conjunction with the governor.  This is a power that the state should reform, but not abdicate.  (For those who feel that ourside commissions are more independent, I would point to California, where reports indicate the majority party was able to manipulate the process to pass its preferred pla

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do not.  While a citizen's commission might be good idea for giving input, it is still the General Assembly's duty to redistrict after every census.  It would be a dereliction of the Legislature's Constitutional duty to pass the buck to an unelected commission.  Indeed, how "independent" would this commission be?  How would the citizens be selected?  Who would do the selecting? There are too many questions regarding this for me to support it.  It appears that any commission would be just as political as the process we have now.

I did many hours of tabling for the cause at local fairs including Pineknotters Festival in Northumberland, Sunbury Riverfest and Ralpho All Home Days. The need for a non-partisan redistricting process is obvious, every vote matters and politicians should not have the power to draw their own districts. I was very pleased to see the PA. Supreme Court order the redistricting for the congressional seats for the November 2018 election. We WILL have a fair system of redistricting in place by the time the results of the 2020 census are ready for redistricting purposes!

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I support SB 22 and  HB 722 as I feel they represent the best ideas to stop the problem of gerrymandering of districts in Pa, and will truly help to fairly represent the PEOPLE of Pa.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, we need districts that represent the people who live in them, not the party they belong to. Politicians drawing the district lines is like hiring the weasel to guard the hen house.   The people of Pennsylvania all deserve to be represented no matter their political affiliation.

It happens way too often which creates instability. The more stability you have within the district boundaries the better your constituents will be served.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Senate bill 22 and  722  are absolutely needed in our state . Harrisburg is corrupt with senators and legislators that are easily influenced by outside interest . This  would take the decision making out their hands and into independent citizens that can make  fair and rational decision. It’s a step in letting the citizen in our Commonwealth have their proper say in government.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> When redistricting is done to provide benefits to our constituents and make the district function on a positive measures then it can be considered. However, when it is done for the soul purpose of gaining power, to a party which is called gerrymandering, than absolutely not!

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> One of my first assignments as State Sen. John Blake's legislative director was to draft legislation creating an independent commission to redraw legislative and congressional districts.  As a staffer, and now a candidate, I firmly believe voters should be picking their politicians -- not the other way around.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support an independent citizen's redistricting commission that would end the practice of politicians hand-picking their voters. Our founders never intended for such partisan abuse of the redistricting process or for such entrenched majorities. As Sen. Blake's legislative director, it was a privilege to work on his and other proposals to end gerrymandering. If the extreme inequity of Pennsylvania's current reapportionment plan was not enough to produce change, the recent court ruling throwing out those unfair maps should be.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Currently, the legislature is a body elected by the people and one of the responsibilities of the legislature, every ten years, is to carry out redistricting.  While I support an open, transparent and fair process, I do have concerns about taking the redistricting process out of the hands out elected officials, who are accountable to voters on election day, and putting it in the hands of an appointed commission that is completely unaccountable to the people of Pennsylvania. If the commission is not as non-partisan and unbiased as we hoped how will we deal with this problem? Gerrymandering is a problem that we have been wrangling with since 1812 and became a very big issue in the case filed by the League of Women Voter's in 2017 against the 2011 redistricting process.

I have sponsored legislation and spoke out against the gerrymandering of districts. My efforts to change this process includes me personally filing a lawsuit after the horrible splintering of my district during the last redistricing process. I took a stand AGAINST the redistricting of my district that saw historically aligned neighborhoods split apart. I stand by my support of the legislation to take the process out of the hands of politicians, firmly and permanently giving the power and the determination to the people.<br>

<b>Vote411 response:</b> On December 20, 2011 I cast a no vote on a badly gerrymandered map that not only divided Berks County but was nationally ridiculed for it's lack of compactness. I made the decision to act independently and vote against a flawed map that I was strongly encouraged to vote for. The entire gerrymandering episode is a lesson on the need to act based on principle without regard for party alliance. I have been fighting for redistricting reform when it was not fashionable to do so and in fact cost you something to defy convention. The current redistricting system needs an overhaul that empowers citizens to construct compact districts without regard to political alignment.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I am very aware of HB722.  I fully support legislation that will once and for all end gerrymandering.  

This is a complete campaign statement regarding the state of our democracy....

American Democracy is deteriorating. I strongly believe that every American has not only a right to vote but a responsibility to vote and to be engaged in our Democracy. We should be making it easier for individuals to vote, and be engaged constituents, not more difficult.  There are many factors that have created this decay in our American Democracy – the two-party system, the significant influence of special interests, the lack of campaign finance regulations, gerrymandering and voter restrictions. 

There are many suggestions I would purpose at the state level to improve and strengthen our Democracy:

1.    We should be making it easier for citizens to vote through proposals such as automatic voter registration, same-day registration, improving the absentee ballot system, extending voting from one day to multiple days and ensure the State’s voting machines are upgraded to include an electronic voting machine with a verifiable paper backup.

2.    Pennsylvania needs to end gerrymandering once and for all. We cannot rely on our courts to correct the failed and unfair mapmaking of the Pennsylvania Legislature. Pennsylvania needs to create an independent citizens commission in charge of both legislative and congressional redistricting.

3.    Pennsylvania needs meaningful and real Campaign Financing Reform!  Pennsylvania has virtually no campaign donation limits. A good starting place would be to at least implement the federal guidelines.

For too long special interests and wealthy donors have had an outsized influence on our elections.  It is time for Pennsylvania to put democracy back in the hands of the people!  It is time to Put People Before Politics!<br>

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. The PA redistricting process is a key example of how Harrisburg fails Pennsylvanians. It is important, regardless of party affiliation, for voters to be choosing their representatives, and not the other way around. In the absence of competitive districts, legislators are no longer accountable to Pennsylvanians. Whether its the State House, the State Senate, or U.S. Congress, our representatives should never take their reelection for granted. Instead, we must ensure that our representatives work hard every cycle to earn the support of the voters in their district, and prove that they go to Harrisburg or D.C. to fight for the interest of their constituents. Every single one of their voters are held responsible for the quality of their work at their jobs every day, and our legislators should face the same pressure.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> When I take the oath of office I�ll swear to defend the Pennsylvania Constitution. It vests the authority for drawing maps in the legislature, with the courts serving as check and balance. I believe that elected officials are accountable to the voters and I am sure that Pennsylvania�s voters would find such a group of non-elected bureaucrats lacking voter accountability.  I don't support adding another piece of bureaucracy to accomplish what is already spelled out in the state Constitution.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> YES. Altering the process by which these districts are creating will result in fair districts that serve a as more accurate representation of the will of the people. This, in turn, will lead to better legislators with a stronger connection to the people they represent. Additionally, extremely gerrymandered districts lead to electoral incentives to appeal only to the extremes of both parties, leading towards less incentive for compromise. I believe that a fairer redistricting process will create more political incentives towards compromise, a goal that I think both parties can agree on.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> We must pass this common sense legislation as soon as possible. For certain incumbents want to be re-elected. But that is done by effectively serving their constituents and the citizens of our Commonwealth. Not by carving out safe seats that do nothing to ensure that everyone has a voice in who serves them.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I fully support reforming the redistricting process. Too many of our citizens are cut out of the election process either directly through gerrymandering or 'voluntarily' check themselves out of the process in frustration. The legislative process demands that all citizens have the right to engage in selecting who represents them without prior restraint.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am a strong advocate for electoral and redistricting reform  Voters should choose their representatives -- representatives should not be choosing their voters. We need a fair and reasonable process where the potential for partisan abuse is minimized. Across America, voters have been dismayed by hyper-partisan legislatures implementing unfair redistricting plans. I believe these kinds of political games compromise the integrity of our political system. I support an independent citizen's redistricting commission to fairly and honestly redraw Pennsylvania's legislative districts. We need an open and transparent redistricting commission that reflects the will of the people, not the self-interests of legislators.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do and I am a co-sponsor of the bill to do just that.    I think that it is imperative that we get the partisanship out of redistricting.  For too long politicians have had too much influence in the drawing of their districts.  The end result has been a government run by people elected by the extremes of each party.  The incentive is to make your side happy, not to work in a constructive way to solve the problems facing Pennsylvania.  We need people elected to office who want to solve problems and work together, not partisan bulldogs looking to do nothing more than score political points.    I am a problem solver that has worked across the aisle to attract jobs, protect working families, and to put the needs of our community first.  I believe non-partisan redistricting could help Harrisburg work again.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I fully support the creation of a nonpartisan and independent commission to draw ALL political maps in Pennsylvania. It's the only way to ensure that each person's vote will count equally! We deserve a fair democracy, and an independent commission will make democracy fair in Pennsylvania again. No more one-sided maps on either side!<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Absolutely. I support an independent commission to redraw the electoral map. It's the only fair way to ensure the democratic process. When districts have been gerrymandered, they discount the voices of some, and unfairly weight the voices of others. I was elated that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of the League of Women Voters', and agreed that the congressional districts had been gerrymandered for political gain. I'd like to see the state assembly districts given the same attention. How poetic, that almost 100 years after women fought for democracy through the right to vote, women are still fighting for democracy through fairly drawn districts. I will support legislation that allows an independent commission to draw the electoral map. One person should be entitled to one vote in a democracy, and an independent commission will ensure that each person's voice counts the same.

It's important to note that the recent state Supreme Court ruling which ordered congressional districts to be redrawn is not permanent, and it does not address state legislative districts. The Constitution mandates that political districts be redrawn every ten years to reflect population shifts. Political districts could once again be gerrymandered for the 2020 election. It's make no sense allowing the party that controls the General Assembly to draw political districts to their advantage. I support fair districts, and we can accomplish that objective with an independent non-partisan redistricting commission.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support reforming our redistricting process.  It is clear that citizens are losing confidence in our current process.  I think it is important to find a way to ensure that our voters have a seat at the table and an independent process is undertaken to ensure balanced and fair maps.  I would be open to an independent citizens commission to oversee the process, and it is vital that we establish it in a way that truly is independent of politics.  Free and fair elections are the backbone of our democracy and republic and that starts with an open and trusted process for drawing legislative maps.  We must do everything in our power to remove partisanship from the process and make sure our voters are not disenfranchised.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I fully support putting an independent citizen�s redistricting commission in charge of both congressional and legislative redistricting. In 2016, I pledged to support redistricting reform, and I still firmly stand by that. We cannot have consistent fairness in our elections if the same politicians who are running for office are also responsible for drawing the districts they�d be running it: it poses an unresolvable conflict of interests. While the recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling striking down the congressional gerrymandering was good progress, we need a permanent fix to prevent gerrymandering in the future, and to apply that to legislative redistricting as well. It�s absolutely disgraceful that the Borough of Pottstown was carved between two State House districts, intentionally diluting and weakening its voice in Harrisburg. It�s well past time to take politics out of redistricting, reunite our municipalities and communities, and bring fairness to Pennsylvania.

I was a co-sponsor to the 2017/18 HB722 until it was amended in the House State Government Committee.  The amendment was a “gut and replace” amendment that removed all of the original language and replaced it with language that would have only members of the General Assembly on the commission to redistrict/reapportion congressional and legislative districts.<br>

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I wholeheartedly support reforming Pennsylvania’s redistricting process and implementing an independent redistricting commission to create districts which will truly reflect the makeup of the electorate, rather than the wishes of power-hungry Harrisburg politicians. Allowing the majority party in the state legislature to draw the district maps is a case of letting the fox run the henhouse, with unscrupulous incumbents being given free rein to put their own best interests above those of the people whom they are supposed to represent.

If elected, I will do everything that I can to make a redistricting system for Pennsylvania which ensures that the maps are written in a fair and honest matter, devoid of political influence or ambition.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Pennsylvania has become a national example of how not to draw the boundaries of its legislative and congressional districts. We have seen our local communities, such as Upper Dublin and Upper Moreland, divided by totally arbitrary lines unrelated to the interests of local residents. We need an independent process, such as proposed by Fair Districts PA. It is time that we put the interest of citizens ahead of the interests of incumbent politicians in securing lifetime health benefits for them and their families after ten years of service.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Pennsylvania ranks third worst in the nation for the fairness of its electoral boundaries. This is a result of the Gerrymandering of our legislative boundaries. I support implementation of an independent citizen�s redistricting commission to address the need to reform the congressional and legislative redistricting process. I am an original sponsor of House Bill 722 which is a bipartisan bill that amends the Pennsylvania Constitution be establishing an Independent Redistricting Commission. Such a commission would provide a nonpartisan process for redistricting in the Commonwealth for State Senate, State House, and Congressional districts. The Independent Redistricting Commission would be tasked to draw boundary lines and would be beholden to politicians, political leaders, nor political parties.  This proposal ensures that State Legislature and Congressional districts are drawn in an equitable, fair, and impartial manner and would address Gerrymandering in a meaningful manner.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do not think that an additional redistricting process would have the desired impact that is intended for Pennsylvania.  The idea of an "independent" redistricting commission is a wonderful idea, but it invents a false narrative that the commission would be entirely unaffected by personal biases and party goals.  It is better to allow any redistricting commission to commence without putting on a fa�ade of impartiality, and rather let all parties come to a mutually beneficial agreement on how to do what's best for all the various voices of different people in our state.  I am more dedicated to being honest with the voters of Pennsylvania than I am about trying to play "fair" when it is inevitable that not everyone will be completely satisfied with the final outcome.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I am an avid supporter/advocate for Fair Districts PA. Gerrymandering disenfranchises and silences voter's voices.  Gerrymandering contributes significantly to the selection of candidates who represent the fringe views of their constituents and not the majority. I fully support redistricting reform that removes elected officials from the process and institutes an independent citizens' commission to draw the maps.  During my tenure as mayor of West Chester, the PA Reapportionment Commission proposed dividing our Borough in half, putting half of our County Seat in a predominantly Delaware County House District! This gerrymandering would have disenfranchised half of the voters in our Borough, including a large portion of our minority voters and students. Together with two other residents, I testified and fought against this egregious gerrymandering. We prevailed in our appeal to the PA Supreme Court. I will continue to fight so that every vote counts. LWV: Your Vote is Your Voice!

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. Gerrymandering is a bipartisan issue that has hurt democracy and disproportionately targeted minorities. Political laziness and expediency has prevented the issue of gerrymandering from being solved. When a political party has the power to draw the lines that decide their own fate there is no longer a true democracy. These borders are tactically drawn in order to make state house races less competitive. In order to make as many districts safe or easy for a party to win, legislatures often pack as many voters from the opposing party into as few districts as possible. This limits the opposing party�s power throughout the government. In the end, this can lead to a one-party dominated legislature that does not reflect the will of the people.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I do not currently have any link to share, but in my previous role as Chief of Staff I supported HB 722 efforts on behalf of Rep Carolyn Comitta. I am very disappointed by the House Republican amendment to the bill that eliminates an independent commission. This undermines the intent of the bill entirely in my view and indicates an unwillingness to truly end gerrymandering. I will continue to speak out on this issue and in support of an independent commission.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. Our current process and the gerrymandering of districts has exacerbated partisan politics and contributed to the creation of a government that protects itself instead of serving the interests and priorities of the voters.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> yes I do support reforming our redistricting process but I believe a system requires the legislature and a independent citizen commission to work together to draft legislative and congressional district but with the legislature voting for approval of the changes as required by both the state and national constitution can work.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I do support an independent citizen's redistricting reform. I believe that the power of creating the maps should not come from those who represent the districts. It creates inequality and silences the votes of individuals. We need to pass legislation to take the redistricting process out of the hands of the legislatures.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I am a co-sponsor on HB722, the Fair Districts bill, and support reforming our congressional and legislative redistricting process to implement an independent citizen's redistricting commission. The People should choose their elected representatives, not the other way around. Gerrymandering has led to virtual gridlock in Washington, DC and state capitals across the nation, including Harrisburg, and in order to make progress on any number of important issues, we must have fair districts.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> We use our votes to determine our leadership. Our leadership in turn must address these issues of redistricting in a manner that represents the voters will. I think the most recent events in Pennsylvania although long in coming proves once again our system works, that is the system of checks and balances. I'm not convinced that an Independent Citizens Commission would derive a different result and at any point in the process the elected Legislature will surely interject the,selves into the process.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> My opponent was one of only two representatives in Delaware County who did not support HB 722.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. I am a strong supporter of the efforts of Fair Districts, and have worked with them on specific initiatives.  The legislative maps drawn in 2011 showed us the real danger in allowing politicians to determine the contours of their own voting districts: far too often, they act in their own interest, and not in the interests of the people of Pennsylvania.  This is true of both Republicans *and* Democrats.  I support the establishment of an independent redistricting commission. Recently, I listened to testimony from members of California's citizens redistricting commission regarding their experiences with the redistricting reform.  I was heartened to hear that each member, whether Democrat, Republican, or independent, found the process to be positive and  worth the effort.  If the redistricting reform bill has not passed by the time I take office, I will co-sponsor the bill.  Voting districts should reflect communities, not calculated political advantages for incumbents.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I support reforming our congressional and legislative redistricting process to implement a transparent, impartial and ethically bound independent citizen's redistricting commission. The best subject matter experts, available research and data demonstrate clearly that there is a formula as well as objective standards and criteria that can be applied to create fair and just boundaries that do not advantage one party, person or candidate over another. Our commitment to serve our district, when we are sworn in, means committing to serving *every* voter in the district, and to that end, we must create a just and fair system of government in order to distribute resources and provide services well to all of the constituents in our districts and the Commonwealth - free of interference from partisan, corporate or interest groups. The political will exists for this reform in Harrisburg. Strategic legislators will be able to get this work done if we elect experienced servant leaders with skill.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I will begin by reminding your members that I have a long record of independence and supporting government reform initiatives. For example, following the infamous pay raise vote, which I voted against, I was appointed to the Speaker's Reform Commission, which put forward many good government recommendations and resulted in the repeal of the pay raise and ended less-than-transparent legislative practices like late night voting.  I agree with you that we have a need for redistricting reform in Pennsylvania. I support implementing a process that takes politics out of redistricting. However, despite having met with many groups and engaging in several local meetings with constituents on the topic, I have yet to learn of a plan that is without political input. I hope all groups can continue to work together to find a fair solution and am willing and ready to be part of those dialogues.

Six states already have citizen commissions in place and it appears that these independent commissions have created fair districts and Pennsylvania should follow suit.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> In 2017, as Solebury Township Supervisor, I spearheaded a resolution urging our state senators to pass SB22  and our state rep to pass similar legislation when it was introduced (this was before HB722). As a citizen, I personally met with Senator McIlhinney asking him to support SB22. I recently submitted a letter to the editor to the Bucks County Courier Times on this topic and hope it will be published soon.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Gerrymandering of legislative and congressional districts is detrimental to our democracy by allowing politicians to choose their voters instead of voters choosing their representatives. It pushes politicians to be more and more extreme and reduces bi-partisan cooperation.   I strongly support redistricting reform with an independent citizen's commission. As a Solebury Township Supervisor, I drove the passage of a resolution urging state lawmakers to pass SB22 and HB722, which calls for the creation of a truly independent citizens redistricting commission devoid of political motivation or partisanship. I also met with my state senator to urge him to cosponsor SB22. This is the only way to ensure a fair and accurate legislative and congressional redistricting process that respects political subdivisions and communities of interest and prohibits districts from being drawn to favor or discriminate against a political party or candidate.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I believe the recent fight over redistricting illustrates the need for change and, as Representative, I would support an independent redistricting commission that takes partisanship out of the process; we must ensure that how we establish this prevents special interests and partisan interests from influencing or corrupting the commission or process.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I am in full support of Fair District's work to change existing laws to allow for an impartial, independent citizen's commission to establish and maintain fair districting lines. Politicians-regardless of party-should never have the power to remain in office via gerrymandering. It is the people who vote elected officials in office, and the people should hold the power to create and encourage a fair playing field for all. Residents shouldn't have to cross two or three county lines just to be heard by their legislators. I applaud and support the bipartisan approach already taken with legislators co-sponsoring HB 722 and SB 22, and would like to see these bills passed. We must respect the electoral process and ensure fair and legitimate districts that properly represent the voting body.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. In fact this is my top priority.  Honored to be 2nd (behind the co-prime sponsors) on HB722 for an independent citizens commission for redistricting.  The impact of gerrymandering is seen everyday.  Ideological rigidity prevents true dialogue &amp; therefore, rarely compromise.    This topic is critical and integral to what and how policy is developed and passed in the state.  I have covered this topic in each of my 71 town halls beginning in July of 2011.  On my Facebook page, Rep DeLissio, I have created an album of pictures that demonstrates that gerrymandering happens across the commonwealth, effects both parties and is prevalent at the state and federal level.  Gerrymandering disenfranchises voters and one could draw the conclusion that is indeed the goal.    An opportunity to spend significant time with 3 of the inaugural commissioners from California&#39;s Independent Commission has reinforced for me the need to change this process in PA. The outcomes are amazing. #FairandSquare

<b>Vote411 response:</b> My position has changed over the years. I would fully support a truly independent redistricting commission. What has changed my position is the negative effects of gerrymandering on politics both locally and nationally.  Gerrymandering has created an environment that is very friendly to extreme candidates from either party. This has hurt the ability to pass legitimate bi-partisan legislation.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. Ensuring our elections are free and fair is of paramount personal importance. Without free elections and the capacity to truly choose our representatives, our democratic process loses its essential character. For too long, government has allowed entrenched partisan political power to perpetuate itself by hand-selecting sympathetic voters, silencing communities, and denying demographics a representative seat at the table. If re-elected, I will rededicate my work to end this pervasive problem and support SB 22 (2017), a joint resolution to establish an independent redistricting commission.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I support reforming the redistricting process.  In our democracy the greatest power each citizen has is the right to vote.  This right should not be diminished by the party in power's efforts to construct districts which favor that party or individuals to ensure their election or re-election.  There are ways - including an independent citizen's redistricting commission - that would help ensure a non-partisan level "playing field."  One person, one vote is essential to maintain the confidence in our system of government.  Our legislators should be prepared to represent each of their constituents, and stand ready to campaign in districts that are fairly drawn to reflect the views of everyone residing in the district.

I was a co-sponsor on PA House Bill 722, which was designed to bring this vision into a reality: instead of allowing incumbents to choose their constituents, a reformed redistricting process using census data and transparent to the public enables fairer elections by ensuring power rests with all voters. While HB 722 has faced difficulties, I am optimistic that the Commonwealth will move on from its gerrymandered past and lead the country as a model of judicious enfranchisement.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. I am a founding member of Fair Districts PA Bedford County and support non-partisan redistricting. Decisions should be made based on what is good for citizens, not politicians. Evidence of gerrymandering in the 78th District includes Franklin County being divided into four legislative districts. That diminishes the power of the county as a whole. Bedford County is divided between the 69th and 78th Districts. It is already difficult for citizens in rural counties to make their voices heard, and gerrymandering makes that harder. Let�s take political manipulation out of the process. If we return power to the voters, there will be higher turnout and better candidates. I support PA Senate Bill 22 and PA House Bill 722.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I am 100% for an independent citizens commission to reform this mess our current legislators have put us in!   My District, in particular, has been impacted so much by this that Mr. Metcalfe has been able to do whatever he wants; due to his 13 Republican to 5 Democrat ratio!  I have been a life long constituent here, and, the focus of this campaign (when I decided I was going to do this) was to work hard and bring people of all parties together, once and for all.  I’m not a politician, but I’m proud to say I was raised with a good amount of common sense.   The thought of putting this redistricting process back in the hands of the people that caused it in the first place, AND make it an even number bodied commission is lunacy!  

So, if he won’t let HB722 go through with what was supported by over 100 plus members of the legislature and countless citizens alike, then I have to take matters in my own hands, starting with this election.  First and foremost, Yes I’m running on the Democratic ticket, but I’m not running as a part; I’m running as a constituent that has had enough.  By staying true to that comment, I will be working hard to earning the votes of ALL voters of this District!  I am working to bridge the divide that Metcalfe as continued to drive a wedge between and work with local leaders and bring back the necessary improvements our District has been needing - and have been constantly ignored by him and his federalized views.

For HB722, I feel that by keeping the commission independent, it places the voice of voters ahead of the greedy want of a cushy seats for legislators like Metcalfe.  He’s scared that he’s finally seeing an opponent that can stand up to him, an opponent that isn’t going to back down from his immature words and an opponent who is making it his priority to speak with every voter and explain how we can get our District’s voice back to Harrisburg; by not voting straight party!  A vote for change isn’t by voting straight party, it is by voting for the best person!  I have until November, and right now we have so many Republicans, Democrats and Independents on board, we can only continue to strengthen.  

It’s time for true leadership; do I think I’m
The answer?  I’d like to think so, but it’s my job until November to prove that to ALL the people of this District.  As I said, as a life long constituent, I’m tired of sitting idly by and watching him do this election year after election year.  I love my current job and really don’t need this job, but I feel I have to do this; not only for my passion of this District, but to echo that voice to him that we are sick and tired of his antics!  I do know, a win for PA HD12 is a win for PA as a whole.  We may still be in the minority, but at least the #1 obstructionist will be GONE!<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes.  For far too long a majority in our legislature has had a ruling hand on redistricting, only to secure their place in the political arena.  To assign this to an independent citizen�s commission, I feel, would provide a voice geared more FROM the people, rather being TOLD what to do from the PA House.  In my District, House District 12, Daryl Metcalfe has held on to a 13 Republican to 5 Democract ratio since 2002.  Before, it was 13 Republicans to 11 Democrats.  This has to change!

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Gerrymandered district lines weaken the power of our votes and plenty of politicians are working behind closed doors to keep it that way. We are all paying the price as many incumbents work to draw lines that protect their seats — leaving them free to ignore our needs and voices because they feel comfortable in winning reelection given the boundaries. We’ve seen a disturbing cycle in Harrisburg and in Washington where incumbents are too comfortable, while the people they’re supposed to serve feel 
powerless and voter turnout decreases. 

I believe that citizens should be able to participate in the process and that clear standards for equality, fairness, and integrity should be guiding principles during the process. I support a citizen commissions for non-partisan redistricting to limit gerrymandering.

I proudly support any policy that gets money out of politics, increases public participation and the accountability of public servants, and gets us closer to the definition of democracy: one person, one vote. I support constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United and end corporate personhood. Knowing firsthand how hard it is for non-establishment politicians to run for office, I would like to see a public small-donor matching system for Pennsylvania. I also strongly support automatic voter registration, same day voter registration, early voting, making election day a public holiday or moving it to Saturday, and voting by mail.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes. I support an independent citizen's redistricting commission because elected officials shouldn't be choosing their voters. Voters should be choosing their elected officials. The current gerrymandering of our districts is undemocratic.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Both sides of the aisle gerrymander which is why it is imperative that something as important as protecting the vote of every Pennsylvanian citizen with a fair and balanced map be put into the hands of an independent commission of citizens.   We have seen how well the legislature has done drawing the maps (#sarcasm), now it is time to return this most important task to those who will do it fairly and without political intent.  After all, if the politicians are so sure that they have the right message and the right direction for Pennsylvania, then why do they feel the need to rig the maps to ensure their party's victory?  Run on your own merits and your own vision, let every vote count and let the best candidate for each district win, regardless of party.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes I do.  The only way to protect the integrity of the Pennsylvania election is to have the districts drawn by an independent commission that is not beholden to either party.  Everyone's vote should matter and in a fairly drawn district, they will.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> I recognize that the 177th district where I am running has been heavily gerrymandered for many years to ensure that one state house district in overwhelmingly Democratic Philadelphia sends a Republican to Harrisburg. I advocate for taking the redistricting function out of the hands of incumbent politicians who have a self-interest in choosing their own voters, and placing it in the hands of a nonpartisan commission.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> Yes, I support reforming our congressional and legislative redistricting process to implement an independent citizen's redistricting commission. The district that I am running in, house district 177, is one of the worst examples of gerrymandering in our state. It was carved out in 2012 by the Republican incumbent to preserve his seat in an increasingly Democratic area of Philadelphia. As a result, many sections of the district are no more than 5 city blocks wide making it difficult to effectively represent constituents and build community. Having a truly non-partisan commission draw maps would create cohesive districts that benefit constituents and keep politicians honest.

<b>Comments from candidate:</b> Quite simply, voters need to be choosing their legislators; legislators should not be choosing their voters. Democracy demands no less. The Congressional Districts Pennsylvania Legislators created in 2011 have been an embarrassment to the state.

I support the efforts of Fair Districts PA to create an independent citizens' redistricting commission to handle the redistricting process. Quite simply, legislators cannot be trusted to create the districts.

I will fight for and support amending the Pennsylvania State Constitution to have an independent citizens' commission in control of the redistricting process.<br>
<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> I do.  While I  applaud the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision--which removed 1,139 miles of unnecessary divisions between and within communities of Pennsylvania voters, divisions that Republican lawmakers put in place primarily to give themselves a political advantage over their Democratic opponents"--redrawing the 2011 congressional map is a temporary solution. Redistricting will happen again after the 2020 Census, and if it follows the same process as last time, the 2021 map is likely to be gerrymandered, too�regardless of which party is in power.

<b>Notes from FDPA team:</b> <br>
<b>Vote411 response:</b> We must not let what happened in this decade be repeated when we redistrict in the next decade. The process must be reformed and the time to decide the specific reform is now. Taking the redistricting process out of the hands of legislators and giving it to an independent commission is an extreme measure. We expect our legislators to work hard and work in the best interests of the citizens. To that end, the citizens must hold every legislator accountable for his or her actions. And, instead of punishing all for the sins of a few, we should work to have a process with zero tolerance for rogue behavior. I do support reforms to the process, but I strongly believe as we elect people to work on redistricting fairly, we should continue to expect these people to fulfill their responsibilities in the best interests of all the citizens of Pennsylvania. It may be that we do involve more citizens in the process, but we should also not take away this responsibility from the legislature.

<b>Vote411 response:</b> I strongly support establishing an independent commission to draw congressional and legislative district lines during the redistricting process. This will help keep communities of interest together, reduce county and municipality splits and result in better representation. I introduced HB1835 in 2016 to create a citizen�s commission and negotiated a hearing on the bill in the House State Government Committee. I was glad to see the Senate�s State Government Committee recently had a hearing on the latest Senate Bill.
