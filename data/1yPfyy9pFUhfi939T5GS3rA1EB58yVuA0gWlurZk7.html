<b>Incident:</b> Danielle Karlen's remains were found in a shed on Beardsley Avenue that burned to the ground. The coroner didn't rule on the cause and manner of death for more than two months. Investigators said her body was so badly burned, determining how she died wouldn't be easy. Hours before the fire, neighbors watched a love triangle unfold at the home -- as Karlen fought with a woman she suspected her boyfriend was cheating with. Lauren Phillips, 19, spoke with 17 News a few days after the fire. She denied starting the fire, but said she was the only suspect Karlen's death. No arrests have been made. <br>

The body -- covered by a sheet -- was in the intersection in front of Jefferson Elementary School for hours. Police said the accused shooter, Luis Alberto Ortega-Romero, confronted Venegas, who was slashing his tires. The men briefly argued, and when the victim brandished a knife, Ortega-Romero fired several shots, fatally hitting him in the back. Venegas was an accused gang member with an extensive arrest record, including drug, weapons, and domestic violence charges. Ortega-Romero is out on bail after pleading not guilty to manslaughter charges. BPD said Ortega-Romero and his family have left the area and are staying with relatives for their safety.

<b>Incident:</b> Police reports describe Daniel Mckie, 20, as hysterical when he tried to explain how the special needs infant died. Mckie is the mother's boyfriend, but not the biological father of Anakin Mckie, though they share the same last name. According to police reports, when investigators arrived to calls of baby Anakin not breathing -- he was bruised and already dead. The coroner found Anakin had multiple bruises on his face and trauma to his skull and brain. Daniel Mckie changed his story about what happened to Anakin the day he died, many times. Mckie told investigators anakin was fussy, and when he went to check on him he was already stiff and blue. He also said he picked Anakin up out of his crib, tripped over the baby's oxygen machine and fell against the wall. Child protective services investigated a complaint file January 6 regarding Mckie's behavior toward the infant. CPS reports state investigators looked into the complaint and closed the case a month later, with the claims deemed unfounded. Mckie has been charged with first-degree murder.<br>

<b>Incident:</b> Tobin Phillips, 20, is accused of killing his girlfriend's baby while she was at work. It happened at the High Mountain Apartment Complex on Cherry Lane in Tehachapi. Just two months earlier, Phillips was arrested in Washington state, accused of abusing his own 21 day old baby while the mother was at work. He was set to go on trial in January. According to court documents, in the latest case, Phillips said he killed the baby because he lost his temper. Phillips described how the baby was crying profusely, and when Phillips was left alone with the baby, he snapped. Phillips told investigators he covered the baby's face with a pillow and sat on him until the baby lost consciousness. The report states Phillips then shook the baby which caused his head to strike a metal bar on a futon, which resulted in large injuries on the baby's face. Philips told investigators after the baby was unconscious for a second time, he put the baby into the bath tub and splashed hot water on him, in an attempt to "shock him awake." The baby's mother found the infant dead and alone in the home with several injuries on his head and neck. Deputies located Phillips two hours after the baby's body was found and arrested him at the Fastrip less than a mile from the apartment. When Phillips made his first appearance in court he had bandages around his neck for unknown reason. Phillips has pleaded not guilty.<br>

<b>Incident:</b> Raymond Angel Luna-Martinez, 20, of Lancaster was shot to death in the parking lot of fast trip in Mojave. He died at the scene. His father was also shot, but is recovering. Deputies believe the shooting started as an attempted robbery and the two victims met the suspects in the parking lot. A neighbor had surveillance video of the shooting. The camera angle faces outside the home toward the gas station. It appears the suspected gunman runs down the street, followed by the victim's father. You see some sort of interaction between the two men and the suspected gunman again runs off, eventually going back to the gas station and flee the scene. The sheriff's office said deputies on the way to the shooting spotted the suspect vehicle and saw a gun being tossed from it. A man and a woman -- Dante Strong, 20, and Blu Tuch, 21,were detained at a third location -- at Inyo and L Streets. KCSO said those two have since been arrested. Investigators believe Strong shot both victims. The shooting survivor was taken to a hospital with moderate to major injuries. Strong and Tuch have been booked on suspicion of murder, attempted murder, robbery, conspiracy and aggravated mayhem.<br>

<b>Incident:</b> According to court documents, a wheelchair-bound man with cerebral palsy named Nicholas Dean was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. Only paramedics were involved in the response. Law enforcement never showed up to locate a crime scene. Several weeks later, an autopsy revealed he was the victim of a homicide and had been strangled. A toxicology report also revealed he was given a non-lethal dose of vicodin and a potentially lethal dose of heroin. Documents state Jessica Dean, Nicholas Dean's sister, was in charge of administering medication to the disabled man. Jessica Dean and her live in boyfriend, Michael Hernandez were Nicholas Dean's care takers and the only people home when he died. Hernandez told investigators he was the last person to see the handicapped man alive. He said he noticed Nicholas Dean needed CPR. He later changed his story and said Jessica Dean choked the man hours before his death. Neither Dean nor Hernandez has been charged. This isn't the first time the Dean family has been embroiled in a murder investigation. This isn't the first time the Dean family has been embroiled in a murder investigation. In 2014, Nicholas Dean's biological brother, Jonathan Dean, was murdered, police say by teenage hit-men, who were hired by Nicholas and Jonathan's adoptive father, George Dean. It later came out that George Dean was having a sexual relationship with the teen who pulled the trigger, killing Jonathan Dean. After George Dean was arrested, Jonathan Dean's disabled brother, Nicholas Dean, was placed into the care of his adoptive sister, Jessica Dean. <br>

<b>Incident:</b> Police were investigating a series of robberies when they found the suspect vehicle. Police said they signaled for the car to pull over, leading to a high-speed chase where the suspect vehicle crashed into a tree. After the crash, Rogelio Landa and another suspected robber, Andrew Crotwell,  fled from the car and ran in different directions. Landa was shot and killed. Police said before the vehicle crashed, a gun was thrown from the car. They haven't recovered a weapon, but police found an airsoft gun in the vehicle. Anita Carvajal, 44, was also in the car when the shooting happened. She and Crotwell were both booked on various charges including murder because Landa died during the commission of a felony. The charges were never filed. Landa and Crotwell are accused of robbing a market and a recycling center a few hours before the shooting. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said there was a fugitive warrant out for Landa. They said he was considered a parolee at large. In a jailhouse interview, Rotwell said he and Landa, who he calls Tito, were partners in crime. He said it was their way of making a living. Crotwell said police overreacted when they shot and killed his friend. Officer Spencer Carlson was cleared in the shooting.

<b>Incident:</b> Stacy Duke was strangled to death in a south Bakersfield garage. Her brother, Adam Pittman, said Duke lived a short, hard life. Pittman said their mother had four children -- and Duke was born into foster care. He said the four kids never all lived together and they were always in and out of the system because their mother struggled with addiction. Pittman said he last heard from Duke about 4 months ago when she said she was living in Bakersfield with a boyfriend. Pittman said Duke was forced to grow up too fast. She had social media accounts claiming to be 22 years old. Gerardo Rodriguez, 23, is accused of Duke's murder. A search warrant states a witness told police she saw Rodriguez straddling the teen, using one arm to hold her down, and the other to hold a pillow over her face. The warrant said the witness told police the girl wasn't moving when she saw her. It also states the witness told police Rodriguez and Duke dated at one point. Documents state Duke was obviously deceased and there were possible strangulation marks on her neck. It goes on to describe firefighters at the home seeing a shirtless Rodriguez sweating profusely, mumbling "I'm sorry" to himself. Rodriguez was ordered to undergo psychological treatment at a state mental hospital. In October, the District Attorney's office said it could be months before it's determined if he is mentally competent to stand trial.<br>

The officer was one of six responding to a report of a man who allegedly had a gun. The person who called 9-1-1 told the dispatcher the man brandished a revolver. Police Chief Lyle Martin said Serna didn't respond to the officers commands to take his hands out of his pockets and to stop walking toward them. Martin said Serna was not armed. Martin said officer Reagan Selman -- who fired seven shots at Serna -- joined the BPD in July 2015. Martin said Selman has never been involved in an officer-involved shooting prior to this incident. Records show Selman was involved in an altercation during an arrest downtown in June. <br>

Vela said he drove around with her body in the backseat for six or seven hours before he pulled over and cut the baby out of her womb with a razor blade. Sheriff's deputies followed up on a reported sighting of Vela and he led deputies on a slow-speed pursuit, reportedly hitting multiple cars along the way and attempting to hit a CHP officer. Deputies stopped the Hyundai at Mt. Vernon Avenue and Flower Street and said they discovered Rivera's body inside. Witnesses reported Vela ran from the vehicle with the baby in his arms. Sheriff's officials said he then left the baby, and continued running and was eventually taken into custody. Vela told 17 News he is the Antichrist and he killed his pregnant girlfriend for his god. While he was in jail, Vela killed himself. <br>

<b>Incident:</b> Bullets went flying into the Quality Gas Station in Lamont, killing a father and son, who owned the business. Family members said Juan Aceves, 27, and his father, Heriberto Aceves, planned to sell the Quality Gas Station. A Friday morning in October, three men, two who were armed, walked into the store and demanded money. Surveillance video shows Heriberto Aceves frantically going through his pockets, handing over items to a robber, who hasn't been identified. After more than a minute of being pistol whipped and held at gunpoint, Heriberto Aceves pulls out a gun and fires at the robber. The robber fires back. Video shows the store owner fall to the ground. Gunpowder filled the air as he fired in the direction of the two other robbers who investigators say are Darnell Hammond and Myron Givan. Video shows the unidentified robber run out of the store. Investigators said Hammond stayed back, killing Juan Aceves and taking money from the cash register. Juan Aceves and Heriberto Aceves died at the scene. Sheriff's officials said Hammond ran from the gas station and the three other men drove off, possibly an early 1990s brown Nissan Sentra. Family members were distraught as they learned of the deaths. Judge Colette Humphrey determined there was insufficient evidence to bound Givan over for trial. Charges against him were dismissed. Two other defendants: Jim Langston and Darnell Hammond, are still facing murder charges in connection with the case.<br>

When the chase ended, police said Villarreal ran and fired several rounds at officers. Officers returned fire, killing Villarreal. Lopez and a passenger, Nick Valenzuela, were arrested. Police said a female passenger was released. The officers involved in the shooting were identified by BPD as senior officer Shane Shaff with 14 years of service, officer Brady Barber with 4 years of service, officer Brockett Mueller, officer Steven Mayberry, and officer Brianna Pace, all three with one year of service. During a vigil a friend said Villarreal was a husband, father, soon and a good neighbor. The friend said Villarreal did a lot of good with his life and he would be remembered for how he lived, not how he died. Police said Villarreal was also wanted in connection with a shooting that happened the day before he was killed. In that case, police said he was arguing with a woman near Owens Elementary School when he shot another man who tried to intervene. <br>

<b>Incident:</b> Saddam Ali, 25, was shot outside a convenience store in the 800 block of 8th Street, between P and Q Streets. Ali's wife and three children were just feet away from him as he was shot repeatedly. According to court documents, Wendell Scott and Albert Montelongo confessed to shooting and killing Ali. When he was asked why, Scott reportedly said it was because Ali belonged to a rival gang. Scott and Montelongo are charged with murder, conspiracy, and gang enhancements. The medical examiner said that even though Ali was shot through the chest, the fatal bullet was the one that severed an artery in his leg, causing him to bleed to death. Ali's brother was killed in 2017.<br>

<b>Incident:</b> Damien Wafford was shot to death in broad daylight at Lowell Park. According to police reports, Wafford was with his uncle at the park when two to four men walked up and asked Wafford where he was from. Wafford reportedly said west side. That's when police said the men pulled a gun and fired between five to nine shots. Police said Wafford was struck in the neck and died at the scene. According to documents, the suspect, Nicholas Lancaster, told officers the homicide was gang-related as he was a member of the east bakers Hispanic criminal street gang. Lancaster has pleaded not guilty to several felony charges including first-degree murder, participating in a gang, an possession of a firearm by a felon. Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Zimmer said Lancaster is eligible for the death penalty. Marcus Melgoza was initially charged with accessory, but that charge was later dismissed. Deon Martinez was charged with weapons violations related to the case.<br>

<b>Incident:</b> Isis Sanchez died on Super Bowl Sunday while in her father's care. The coroner determined the 2 year old died of blunt force trauma. Less than two months before she was killed, Isis and her siblings were placed back in the care of their parents, Izaac Sanchez and Anastasia Jordan, after they were taken away by child protective services. Court documents revealed disturbing details about her death. Izaac Sanchez told deputies he put Isis in a few inches of water in the bathtub during halftime of the super bowl. According to documents, he said he left and returned a minute later and found Isis partially submerged. Sanchez then told investigators Isis collapsed in the living room and hit her head and lost consciousness. Deputies said despite inconsistencies in his story, Izaac Sanchez always maintained Isis drowned and he never hurt her. Doctors at Memorial Hospital told deputies there was no sign the girl had drowned and said she had been beaten. Doctors reported Isis suffered a torn liver, rectal tears and head trauma. Doctors declared Isis brain dead. She died at the hospital several days later. Izaac Sanchez is charged with murder. The mother of the child was at church at the time of the incident, and was not charged. <br>

<b>Incident:</b> According to a report from the sheriff's department, Joshua Shane Bispo of Tehachapi was spotted driving erratically. Two CHP officers tried to pull him over, but Bispo took off, leading them on a chase that ended on Farmer's Lane near Weedpatch Highway. Investigators said Bispo pointed a firearm at the CHP officers and tried to shoot, when the officers both fired back. Bispo was taken to Kern Medical where he died of his wounds three days later. The officers, Rosa Archer, an 8 year veteran of the CHP and 7 year CHP veteran Rodney Black, were deemed justified by the sheriff's department, which investigated the shooting. The report also stated Bispo had a blood alcohol content of .23, nearly three times the legal limit, along with methamphetamine in his system. This was the first officer-involved shooting in Kern County in 2016.<br>
