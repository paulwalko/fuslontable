Featuring works by artists such as Tom Burr, Mark Dion, Andrea Fraser, Renee Green, Mary Heilmann, Jutta Koether, Cady Noland, and Christian Philipp Muller, the exhibition will showcase how a new generation of artists employed social and institutional critiques in their work, and how the traditional notion of an art gallery was challenged, as they were repurposed as concert halls, classrooms, social hot spots, and sites for social activism. The project will include public programming and production of a comprehensive catalogue published in collaboration with Dancing Foxes Press and the University of Chicago Press.

<b>Project Description:</b> To support the translation from the German of the sci-fi adventure novel "Mountains Seas and Giants" by Alfred Doblin.<br>
<b>Additional Project Description:</b> Doblin (1878-1957) was a German-Jewish war-time doctor, psychiatrist, public intellectual, and giant of 20th-century literature along with his friends Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann. Despite his immensely prolific writing career with an oeuvre of 30 large volumes, he was known largely for a single book, Berlin Alexanderplatz, after which he was forced into exile by the Nazis. Published in 1924, his 630-page novel, Mountains Seas and Giants, is a history of war-torn civilization and the conflict between technology and nature, from the aftermath of World War I into the 27th century. It presciently describes ecological catastrophe, mass migrations, state surveillance, terrorism, genetic engineering, and biological warfare. Gunter Grass described it as "Doblin's great, exalted novel, forgotten and awaiting rediscovery, written as though in visionary overdrive." This will be the first time it appears in English.

<b>Project Description:</b> To support the exhibition "David Smith: The White Sculptures."<br>
<b>Additional Project Description:</b> The exhibition will be the first ever to focus on the use of the color white in David Smith's (1906-1965) practice. His first sculptures of white coral from the Virgin Islands, as well as a series of eight large-scale sculptures using wood, wire, coral, soldered metal and other found materials, forms the exhibition's nexus, and sheds light on the ethics of custodianship and the artist's intention. After the untimely death of Smith, his executor stripped the white color off of five sculptures (believing it to be primer) to bare metal. The exhibition, which also will feature a film and catalogue, is held in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Storm King's landmark acquisition of 13 David Smith sculptures. The works will be displayed in the center's rolling hills. Smaller works, as well as carefully selected groupings of Smith's paintings and photography that also engage with the color white, will be displayed in the gallery.

<b>Project Description:</b> To support in-school design and architecture residencies for public school students in the greater New York City area.<br>
<b>Additional Project Description:</b> Salvadori teaching artists will use the built environment--buildings, bridges, parks and the urban landscape--to teach students the design process and realize the math, science, and social history embedded in the structures within their communities. The program will culminate in a one-day Annual Design Charrette in which students work with professional architects, designers, and engineers to design, develop, and build a project in response to a design challenge.

<b>Project Description:</b> To support SITI Work/Space, a new model for creating work as an ensemble.<br>
<b>Additional Project Description:</b> Inspired by the visual artist's studio model in which a variety of different pieces are created simultaneously, the company will develop a series of smaller plays in its New York rehearsal studio. The project will support the development of "This American Moment," a new play by SITI Company members with playwright Lucas Hnath and dramaturg Megan Carter; "Chess Match," a new work inspired by composer, music theorist, and writer John Cage; "Hanjo," produced in collaboration with the Japan Foundation; and "Katzelmacher," a new work inspired by the structure of the Rainer Werner Fassbinder film of the same name. Addressing the question of how to create more modular, touring work as the company matures, the initiative is designed to make the creation process more accessible to local audiences, and to serve as a prototype for other ensemble companies.

<b>Project Description:</b> To support the world premiere production of "Everybody," a new play by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, directed by Lila Neugebauer.<br>
<b>Additional Project Description:</b> Taking inspiration from the roots of western drama, notably Greek tragedy and the English medieval theater, the play will explore the notion of theater as a moral act. Recognizing that these early forms were the product of homogenous cultures, the piece will challenge how the reality of modern American history intersects with literary tradition. The production will be Jacobs-Jenkins' second production through Signature's Residency Five program, which supports playwrights over a five-year period as they build a body of work.
