<b>Allocation History (Internal):</b> When we do PB projects, we've also entertained proposals for non-city capital projects. City council does not like non-city capital projects. Difficult to verify with  city agencies whether they can receive capital funds on timeline necessary for PB projects. But this falls into that bucket, and we did it anyway. DCLA might push back - two issues to resolve. Three mobile studios. But in order to be eligible, the studio needs to be at least $30k - only for purchasing materials. The trailer is only $12k. Wanted ArtBuild to become a city vendor. They'd build everything and then space works would buy it from them. DCLA doesn't want art build to become a city vendor. DCLA's misunderstanding of ArtBuild's role. Catherine to continue managing this one and keep me posted. <br>
<b>Next Step (Internal):</b> <br>
<b>Agency(Internal):</b> DCLA<br>
<b>Point person (Internal):</b> Catherine<br>
<b>Contact Info (Internal):</b> Art Build was not eligible, so they partnered with Space Works - who submitted the non-city capital application and was eligible. Now, spending funds is difficult. <br>

<b>Allocation History (Internal):</b> Multi-million dollar project. A new bldg for more bathrooms, meeting space and performance space. Imagines this funding as a down-payment on that project. This will take years and years to add up. Gesture of good faith. Unlike prospect park alliance the Old Stone House cannot run projects itself, so must work through Parks.<br>
