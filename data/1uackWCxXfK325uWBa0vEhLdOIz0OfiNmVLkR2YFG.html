<b>Description:</b> Criminal justice in the UK is at a critical juncture with increases to the number of self-representing litigants impacting on the standard and quality of judgments made in court. The government is not actively assessing the problem and there is a risk of increasing injustice. Commons will be the first not for profit cooperative law firm offering services primarily funded by legal aid payments to help the vulnerable in the system. Commons will also instigate and support projects to increase opportunities for disadvantaged target groups. No other law firm in London is set up in this way or has these explicit goals. Motivated by a desire to see criminal defence advice and representation delivered with an informed and compassionate focus on the needs of clients Commons has been set up by lawyers Rhona Friedman Sashy Nathan and Ben Stuttard. It is intended that the work of Commons not only provides immediate improvement by offering its service to vulnerable clients in London but can have a wider impact by modelling an alternative way of doing law and sharing learning and experiences with the legal and advice communities more widely.<br>
