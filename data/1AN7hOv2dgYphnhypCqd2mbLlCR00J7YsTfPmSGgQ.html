<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 20th and Ankeny, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-06 17:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling eastbound on SE Ankeny, approaching the stop sign at 20th when I heard a loud engine behind me. I saw an older, red pick-up truck going about 10 MPH above the speed limit headed Eastbound on Ankeny. I arrived at the stop sign about 30 seconds or so before this pickup.

When I arrived at the stop sign, I dismounted from the bike as the light at 20th and Burnside was green, allowing N/S traffic to flow along 20th. As I sat at the stop sign waiting for an opportunity to cross SE 20th, the truck whipped around me (by going into the left-hand lane), turned in front of me onto southbound SE 20th, and cut off another motor vehicle in the process (causing them to slam on their brakes).<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NW 14th at NW Glisan<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-29 10:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling in the marked bicycle lane Northbound on NW 14th approaching NW Everett St. 

A driver came up from behind me (i have two flashing lights going in front and rear) then then proceeded to leave their driving lane to cut me off (the light at Everett was turning yellow) and drove in the bike lane and the unoccupied parking spaces to create their own personal right turn lane to use to turn right onto NW Everett. 

However, the light then turned red, and there were pedestrians crossing that they also nearly plowed into trying to beat the light, so they had to stop abruptly, while they continued to block the bike lane, the parking space, and part of the crosswalk on 14th ave going west to east on Everett. 

While that was going on, some OTHER driver then followed that person's lead and drove into the bike lane/parking spaces BEHIND me 
at the red light, then after the first driver had made their turn on red, beeped at ME, as they now felt that I was their way.  As I moved to the (still red) light in the bike lane, that SECOND CAR then also used the empty parking spaces as their own right turn lane and came up tightly to my right.

I would like to note that something of this nature is happening to me personally AT LEAST 2-3x weekly at this intersection when the parking spaces there on the right are unoccupied. People are constantly trying to create a right turn lane with the bike and parking lanes where there is none. Its' really dangerous. <br>

<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Right-hook (overtaking driver at an intersection turns right across cyclist's path), Passing without sufficient space, Vehicle blocking bike lane, Driver/s are driving in bike lanes as well as in parking spaces to create a lane where none exists. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Hall Blvd in Tigard OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-26 12:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Riding westbound on Hall, in a marked bike lane, south of Redtail golf course, across the street from Target.  Young woman driving eastbound in a large black SUV *saw me* and floored it to make a left turn and cut me off, in a hurry to get into Dutch Bros coffee drive-thru, then had to slam on her brakes in order to avoid hitting a car already in the Dutch Bros parking lot.  No need for her to do cut in front of me like that - she could easily have waited 2-3 seconds and then made a safe turn after I passed the Dutch Bros driveway.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> An SUV driver hit me as she overtook me (as I continued straight) and turned right.

I've been commuting for more than 20 years and wonder if a less experienced cyclist would have just been plowed over. The driver got out and started crying, and I had to give her a hug and tell her I was okay.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 57th Ave and NE Sacramento Street<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-04-07 08:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> In early April, the City made a change to NE 57th Ave at the intersection with NE Sacramento St. There is now a painted median in the middle of NE 57th, with bike lanes and auto lanes angling to the right. While cars driving this route have quickly caught onto the street change, many cars are still being parked along the curbs in what is now the bike lane. This creates a dangerous pinch point for cyclists attempting to use the bike lanes, particularly in heavy traffic during commuting hours. Bikes are forced to take the lane or come to an unplanned stop, often while moving quickly downhill (when headed south). 


 


I suspect that part of the issue for parking cars is that they don't realize they are now parking in a bike lane, when 2 weeks earlier the same location was a legal parking spot. On April 8 I requested that the City take action to complete this street modification by adding "No Parking" signs and paint where the bike lane is directly beside the curb, and then by enforcing the no parking areas. The City responded to my email with a "we'll get back to you in 12 weeks" email. They also put up some temporary "no parking" signs, but only prohibiting parking 7 am to 6 pm. And these were often ignored. Perhaps when a crew was out there working something was actually done. 
It took approximately 6 weeks for the city to (mostly) stripe the reconfigured bike lane with something more than spraypaint. No work has been done in this intersection in recent weeks, but the temporary no parking signs are gone, and the no parking areas have not been modified to correspond with the bike lanes. 

I'm not sure what the City's specific intent is with this intersection. My assumption is that it is meant to improve crossing safety for pedestrians attempting to cross NE 57th (despite the presence of a signaled crosswalk 1/2 block further south). Since the lane configuration change, I have observed many more cars stopping for pedestrians at this intersection. If that is the intent, here is some anecdotal evidence that it's working. As things are currently configured, however, the potential safety improvement for pedestrians is far outweighed by the risk to cyclists. I use this intersection as a cyclist, pedestrian, and driver, and the work at this intersection needs to be completed quickly. I hope something can be done quickly and before someone is injured at this intersection.

I have had three near-misses here, that required me braking suddenly or swerving out of the way of  a moving or illegally parked vehicle. I am cautious enough of the known danger to go slowly and with care, now that I've been at risk.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling west on Clinton with my 2-year-old in a bike trailer and my 6-year-old next to me on his own bike. We stopped at the stop sign on 21st and proceeded through the intersection. A car approached from the south on 21st, ignored the stop sign, and aggressively accelerated through the intersection, turning left onto Clinton. Since we were already in the middle of the intersection, the driver pulled into the incoming lane of traffic, swerving dangerously close to me and my small children. I am certain the driver was anxious to not be "stuck behind" us as we traveled this Safe Route to School and Neighborhood Greenway. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> A bicyclist was riding on Tillamook. A car turned right onto Tillamook directly in front of the cyclist.

The motorist then drove their vehicle directly toward the cyclist, who had to swerve to get out of the way.  This was intentionally threatening and intimidating behavior.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was stopped on Alberta at the intersection with the I-5 off ramp headed west, and I biked forward when it was my turn at the 4-way stop, but the car headed off of I-5 proceeded at the same time. I slammed on my brakes but got side swiped by the car. I fell to the ground and the driver continued driving back onto the highway. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 28th &amp; Powell<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2014-03-03 18:51:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was driving East on Powell in the right lane around SE 28th. To my left, also traveling East, was a large panel truck. The truck suddenly stopped so I figured something was going on. I came to a stop, even with the front of the truck, only to discover an individual crossing the road. I had absolutely no visual on that pedestrian until the last minute.

That simple decision prevented a lot of grief for a lot of people, including myself.  Let others' driving habits speak to you, even if you see no danger lurking.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> sw taylor at sw 2nd, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-20 07:35:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was travelling West on SW Taylor between 1st and 2nd. I was occupying the right-hand lane, which I believe to be safer on this particular block, and another cyclist was occupying the left lane. As we traveled between 1st and 2nd a silver Range Rover swerved between the two cyclists, from the right lane to the left, deliberately crowding me in my lane and gunning his engine. We both stopped at the red light on 2nd, the driver rolled down his window shouting obscenities including "get your f***ing piece of s**t off the road" at a level of rage that cannot be safe for a man of his build; you can picture the guy, balding overweight white guy in expensive clothes - basically just who you expect to driving a Range Rover like he's the only person on earth. I shouted back, trying to keep the altercation verbal rather than give him the opportunity to act out the homicidal rage in his eyes. 

When the light turned green, he peeled out and took off at a high rate of speed. I looked up and saw there was a Portland Police Supervisor in his car just around the corner. I stopped to report the incident to the officer who was oblivious to all the screaming and the speeding vehicle leaving the scene some 30 ft away from his vehicle and showed no inclination to take any kind of action - to be fair, I hadn't gotten a plate # but the offender was still only a block away.


Summary: Raging asshole in silver Range Rover deliberately menacing cyclists downtown. I suspect that he works within a few blocks of this location and is a serial offender. Let's get this menace off the streets before he kills someone or strokes out from unjustified anger.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Myself and two other people on bikes were heading East on Lloyd and were turning onto NE 12th when a driver passed us in the same lane and then turned right into the left lane of NE 12th (the same lane that we were trying to turn into). All three of us narrowly avoided getting hit by moving into the right lane and hugging the curb. We then got subsequently passed dangerously close by nearly every single other right turning vehicle. 

The sharrows on the right lane seem to give the impression to drivers that bikes don't "belong" in the left lane. <br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-30 15:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> While on the pedestrian path that follows the south edge of N Columbia I was preparing to cross N Fiske. The pedestrian signal changed to indicate that crossing was safe, however knowing how dangerously people drive on Columbia, before proceeding I looked behind me over my right shoulder to check for west bound traffic making a left. As I did so, a car traveling at a high rate of speed made just such a turn, coming within no more than a foot of me as I stood on the curb - turning entirely into the oncoming travel lane on Fiske to accommodate the rate of speed at which she was making the turn. 

If I had not instinctively checked for just such behavior and proceeded into the crosswalk when the signal indicated it was safe to do so I would have certainly been hit and quite likely have been killed given the speed the driver was traveling. <br>

I slowed and went around the semi and got the driver's attention. He berated me for "blocking traffic" even though he was the one who was causing the problems! 

Right here, there are streetcar tracks, so forcing bikes around his vehicle is dangerous due to the high speed of traffic and the tracks. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was heading north on 31st on my bike. The intersection with Brooklyn is at the bottom of a little dip, and has stop signs for cars on Brooklyn but no control for cars &amp; cyclists on 31st. I typically use the dip to get some speed so I can make it up the next block.

As I approached the intersection, a POLICE CAR did a very fast california stop -- more of a brief slow down -- and entered the intersection without seeing me. As we got closer, with me slamming on my brakes and trying to avoid him, he saw me and hit his brakes. It was a close call.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Northbound driver on Naito blew thru its red right at Yamhill without even slowing, nearly striking bikes and peds in the crosswalk.  I have seen this several times and I think the drivers are looking at their green one block farther north at Morrison and don't notice the red at Yamhill.  Perhaps a signal timing issue, and certainly a problem with high traffic speeds on Naito, which drivers treat as a freeway, not the intensive bike/ped use street that it is and should be.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding eastbound on Overlook (a greenway) toward the traffic light. It was green, and I indicated a right turn onto the bike lane on Interstate.

The oncoming car from across Interstate (Kaiser exit) failed to yield during her left turn and swung wide into the bike lane, nearly hitting me as I turned. Had I been going through the intersection, she surely would have hit me.

I verbally indicated my displeasure ("Hey, watch it."), and at the next light when I caught up, the driver did apologize and indicated she'd not seen me. I can only guess she was not paying close enough attention because I had lights on and it was a sunny day.<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> <br>
<b>What happened?:</b> This is a HORRIBLE intersection.  it is a major intersection for UP with construction trucks, pedestrians, bikers, and cars coming onto the north campus daily.  There is no turning lane.  The bike lane is on the right and to make a left turn into UP, I have to plant myself in the middle of moving traffic waiting to make a left turn.  Cars can't get around me unless I'm in the middle of the intersection and to get around me they have to go into the bike lane.  It's really bad at rush hour b/c of the volume and the fact that everyone is in a hurry.  A bike box is badly needed as well as a turning signal on the light. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 46th and SE Woodstock, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-29 12:05:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was northbound on SE 46th, riding in the bike lane.  The light turned green as I approached the intersection - I could see that the first 2 vehicles in line were turning left and the third car had no turn signal flashing.  As I was going straight, I proceeded to pass the 3 vehicles on the right (still in the bike lane).  Just as I entered the intersection, the third car in line (which I had thought was going straight turned right in front of me.  Because I was hyper alert, I was able to turn right as well and avoid being hit by mere inches.  Had I been less focused by even a little bit, I would have been another right hook victim.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NW MARSHALL ST AND NW 11TH Ave portland OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-01 12:05:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was heading north on NW Marshall st after stopping at NW 11th ave to check for cross traffic (its a one way west on 11th) the Portland Street car had just come to a complete stop at the station to load and unload passengers making (supposedly) safe for me to proceed through the intersection.
2 people driving vehicles accelerated around the street car as I started to enter the intersection, the 2 people operating the vehicles illegally started to pass the street car using half the vehicle lane and half a bike lane. 

I had to slam on my brakes to keep from being hit by the people accelerating around the street car and into the intersection. the lead vehicle recognized that I was entering the intersection and having to slam on my brakes due to her bad decision and subsequently slammed on her brakes coming to a stop just over the cross walk line.
Then motioned for me to proceed!

besides the Peril the person put me in, What if there were someone crossing in that cross walk in front of the street car and I was not there would she have seen them in time?<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking in the bike lane on SW Walker when one of the Nike dumptrucks overtook me close to the intersection, and the operator decided he had enough time to make a right turn on Murray just ahead of me. (He didn't.) I had time to come to a stop to wait, and when the dumptruck was clear and I started to go, a driver in a smaller car (silver Prius?) then turned right in front of me too. If I hadn't been vigilant I would have been right-hooked by 1. the arrogant dumptruck driver 2. the careless driver following his illegal lead.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding west-bound on NE Halsey and turned left onto Cesar Chavez through a stale green light. An east-bound driver on NE Halsey, across Cesar Chavez from me, was waiting at a red light to turn right, also onto Cesar Chavez. As I proceeded into the intersection he also did so, through the red light (presumably he'd stopped at the red seconds earlier), and crossed right in front of me in order to get in the inner south-bound lane of Cesar Chavez (a left turn lane leading to I-84 east). I was able to stop just a foot from his car; he stopped too, but simply scowled and then continued into the inner lane of Cesar Chavez.<br>

The truck missed all three of us by less than a foot. In addition, the truck's back hatch was entirely open and the contents on the bed were shaking around.

He stopped too when I yelled and could reach out and touch her grill. 

When I confronted her, she admitted her traffic violation. She did not apologize to him, ask how he was, or show any concern for his safety. She said she just wanted to get on with her day.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding westbound on Woodstock Blvd when an SUV passed me partially then drifted into the bike lane as the road bends.  I was pushed nearly to the curb.  I was leaning against the car then once I gained control again I beat the side of the vehicle with my fist.  She stopped at the next stop sign and unrolled her window. Her first response was "that is not a bike lane" Uh. Yes. That is exactly what a bike lane looks like. Don't drive in it. Her second response was, "you scared the hell out of me banging on my window" Uh. Yeah, I wasn't scared at all by you nearly killing me. Her third complaint was "I am not like that. I would never do that." Uh. You are like that. You just did that 15 seconds ago. I don't think we can even begin to have a conversation about bike safety when people that think like that are allowed to drive. I noticed her "share the road" license plate as she drove away.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> This is where SE 22nd curves around to become Gladstone.  There's a cement plant and a freight terminal right there.

Trucks driving West into the freight terminal frequently cross through the curve, through the double lines, without slowing.  I saw this happen yesterday, the truck went full speed ahead through the double lines and nearly plowed through a car, to get onto the ramp.

This is an absolutely terrifying spot for cars and cyclists coming the other way.  The trucks have no regard for anyone else coming through the curve and frequently plow right through.  Maybe half of the trucks will stop or slow.  The rest maintain their speed, as its not an especially trafficked area.

Someone is going to get killed here.  There should be a light, or at the very least a stop sign.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 24th and Weidler, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-01 17:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I had to cross from a bike lane  across two lanes of traffic to get to a third lane which was effectively a turn lane.  That third lane had a red light, the two other lanes had a green light.  This was actually the complicated interchange at 24th and Weidler heading eastbound and I had to go from the Weidler bike lane to 24th.

The prior light had recently changed so traffic was light, so I used a hand signal and crossed with plenty of room not to cause any slow down of vehicles.  No obstruction of any kind.  I have a rear view mirror too and can see all around my position.

A woman well over 50 yards behind me (and not the car right behind me, about 50 yards back) rolled down her window (it may have already been down) and honked wildly and repeatedly yelling to get out of the road.  The honking continued even as I stopped for the vehicles in front of me.  Just as I turned around to see what was going on (was there a pedestrian or somebody else she was yelling at that I hadn't seen?), she continued in the straight middle lane and spit at me as she went by.  I only heard the sound of the spitting and saw the spit.  The face went by too quickly for me to register it.

I didn't even know I was the target until the spit came my direction.

The spit didn't get very far.  I was probably 8 feet away, and her spittle went about 3 feet.  Yelling isn't conducive to spit accumulation.

A man also with his window down (I don't know why these people had their windows down, since it was raining lightly), about two cars behind her in the right lane, yelled out with a tone of solidarity, "Just ignore her, she's crazy!"

I suppose it's somewhat comforting to know that not everybody is out to hurt me for the mere act of riding a bike.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 82nd Ave. &amp; SE Overland St., 97222<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-31 17:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Co-worker and I were crossing SE 82nd at SE Overland on the green light heading east straight into the Home Depot / Dick&#39;s parking lot. Opposing left hand turning automobile traffic heading west exiting the parking lot did not yield. SUBARU wagon (metallic tan) w/ one occupant locked eyes w/ me, stuttered for a second, hit her brakes momentarily, then gunned it, putting their automobile directly in a path to left hook me. I hit my brakes and swerved left to miss them and yelled a warning. The vehicle directly behind them was going to follow the same path, but at the last second noticed us clearing the intersection and slammed on their brakes and allowed us to get through the intersection. This is a fairly common occurrence at this intersection. There is NO dedicated left turn arrow. Sometimes I wish I had a HUMMER grille &amp; bumper attached to the front of my bicycle... maybe they would see me then.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW 3rd and SW Taylor, portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-20 07:35:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was travelling West on SW Taylor between 2nd and 3rd.  I was occupying the right-hand lane, which I believe to be safer on this particular block, and another cyclist was occupying the left lane.  As we traveled between 2nd and 3rd a silver Range Rover swerved between the two cyclists, from the right lane to the left, deliberately crowding me in my lane and gunning his engine.  We both stopped at the red light on 3rd, the driver rolled down his window shouting obscenities including "get your f***ing piece of s**t off the road" at a level of rage that cannot be safe for a man of his build; you can picture the guy, balding overweight white guy in expensive clothes - basically just who you expect to driving a Range Rover like he's the only person on earth.  I shouted back, trying to keep the altercation verbal rather than give him the opportunity to act out the homicidal rage in his eyes.  

When the light turned green, he peeled out and took off at a high rate of speed.  I looked up and saw there was a Portland Police Supervisor in his car just around the corner.  I stopped to report the incident to the officer who was oblivious to all the screaming and the speeding vehicle leaving the scene some 30 ft away from his vehicle and showed no inclination to take any kind of action - to be fair, I hadn't gotten a plate # but the offender was still only a block away.


Summary: Raging asshole in silver Range Rover deliberately menacing cyclists downtown.  I suspect that he works within a few blocks of this location and is a serial offender.  Let's get this menace off the streets before he kills someone or strokes out from unjustified anger. <br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-03 21:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking on NE Killingsworth and waiting to turn left onto NE 15th. As I was waiting, I was passed dangerously closely on the right. And when it was clear to go, I started to turn. As I was turning, someone on the opposite side of the intersection (East side) passed a left-turning vehicle on the right and headed straight for me at a high speed. I avoided the vehicle, but it was pretty close. They did not slow down in order for me to complete my turn. 

TL;DR: Two vehicles passed illegally on the right. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Pickup truck hauling a trailer passed me on the left, but did not cross entirely into the other lane. Then the driver came back into the right-hand lane too early, causing the trailer to nearly clip me. The driver also did not signal. 

Since this is a two-lane street w/o any buffer, I take the lane. This is neither the first - and I doubt it will be the last - time that I've nearly been clipped or been passed entirely too close (within three feet) on this road. <br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Passing without sufficient space, Failure to use a turn signal, Lack of safe infrastructure, Inattentive driver<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I had my back flasher on, flag on
A black sedan with 2 kids  Hit my handlebar with his mirror on 47th 
slowed I waved and picked up his mirror magnifying piece
He kept going, chased him to Davis and 48th outside the school where he was dropping off his kids.
He said his 4 year old daughter said they hit a branch.
He apologized 25 times. I asked him how would you feel if you if his kids got hit. Do you know how much helmets help? Not very much. You have children, do I have children?  I pointed to my childs bike connected to mine with a follow-me.
His mirror was bent back where he hit me as evidence, gave him the other part as further evidence.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking eastbound on SE Clinton when an older red Toyota Tacoma (or maybe its predecessor, the T100?) pickup came up behind me. They came up fast, then slowed down and passed way to close trying to run me off of the road. I was riding on the sharrows to avoid the door zone, and the driver clearly was trying to steer towards me. The woman in the passenger seat was looking right at me, but I had nowhere to go. They passed mere inches off of me. The driver immediately brake checked me. As soon as Westbound traffic cleared, they turned left and headed North towards Division. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking uphill (eastbound) on SE Clinton with one of my kids in my bakfiets. The driver of a white vehicle (station wagon type) passed so closely just before the SE 23rd roundabout that I had to jump off my bike and tip it to the right to avoid them smacking the box. I was too shocked to get a good vehicle/driver description or the license plate number.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Gray Prius ran stop sign on Washington to turn right onto Alder without looking to his right.  I was in the road, crossing the street, he missed me by inches.  I don't think he even saw me after missing me, as he never looked right while running the stop sign.

Had I not have been extremely aware of my surroundings, I would have been seriously injured.

The driver that was going northbound on SE 21st went without stopping, as if stopping behind the bicycle counted as stopping.

Subject: Waterfront near miss

Dear Commissioners Fritz and Novick:

This morning I was riding my bicycle to work on the path in the Esplanade a few yards south of the Steel Bridge.  I was wearing hi viz, with a front light on full strobe, in dry daylight conditions, when I was nearly struck head-on by an orange City of Portland forklift being operated in the path.  I was not traveling fast, and I saw when she came from the grass onto the path and started coming at me.  I stopped.  I screamed.  She looked where she was going just in time to stop.  Everyone was ok, this time, but it was a very dangerous and unwelcome situation.  

This path is possibly the most heavily-used path in Oregon for people of all ages to bike, walk, and run.  The City (Parks?) has vehicles on the path to facilitate festivals, and on a daily basis emptying trash cans, etc.  I hope City employees operating vehicles on the path will be extremely careful in this environment.  Hoping that people will be careful, however, doesn’t solve a dangerous environment.

May I suggest:

FLAGGERS

It would be helpful to have standard work zone precautions, such as flaggers and cones, any time the path is being used as a work zone.  This morning there was nobody helping the forklift operator, and no cones or markers for the work zone.

A SAFE PLACE TO RIDE AND WALK ALONG NAITO

Big picture, the waterfront path is overcrowded.  I would prefer not to ride a bike there.  But, there is no connection for my  route–Naito north of the Steel Bridge to downtown–without going onto the path.  Staying on Naito under the Steel Bridge means negotiating multiple shallow-angle railroad tracks (where I have seen bicycle crashes), and narrow bridge footings with fast traffic and no place to ride a bicycle for several blocks.  The only path under the bridge that is not currently in use as an encampment is the one I was on.  

As a daily user for most of the last fourteen years, I increasingly see collisions, near misses, and uncomfortable and unsafe encounters with people who are intoxicated or impaired along the waterfront path, particularly around the Steel, Burnside and Morrison bridges downtown.

I hope soon we will have a safe place to ride, run, and walk along Naito that connects to the Hawthorne and Steel Bridges, and Naito north of the Steel Bridge, as a viable alternative to the overcrowded and currently out-of-control waterfront path.  

Thank you for your work to provide immediate and longer-term solutions.

Scott

<b>What happened?:</b> I was on the east side of Cesar Chavez Blvd, crossing Cesar Chavez Blvd at the traffic signal just south of I-84. The signal had just changed, so that I had the walk sign. I had put one foot into the street when a north-bound car on Cesar Chavez Blvd passed in front of me and turned right on the the I-84 on ramp. The driver did not slow down at all, apparently thinking there was no need to heed the red light because he was turning right.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Bikining westbound on ne Fremont, two ladies and their small children were trying to cross Fremont at 11th coming from Irving park. I took the lane and stopped. The car behind me accelerated into the opposite lane coming within a couple feet of the children. Abhorrent and totally irresponsible.

Reduce the speed limit on Fremont now!<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Distracted driver on Willamette drifted into the bike lane while (not) following the gentle curve of the street. I was forced to swerve into the parking lane to avoid being side swiped. This sort of problem is compounded by the rampant speeding by drivers on this street. 

Willamette could be one of the most pleasant bike and walking areas in the entire city with some minor infrastructure improvements, as it is now it functions as freeway for commuters seeking to avoid the traffic lights on Lombard. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was walking north on the sidewalk approaching Pine.

The driver stopped all the way in the crosswalk, still only looking to his left (north), never checking the sidewalk. As I returned to my office, I noticed that the City has not painted or maintained any crosswalks or stop bars along Grand or MLK. This is a frequent problem for pedestrians along these busy, one-way streets. I believe that safety would be hugely increased if crosswalks or stop bars were painted to indicate where motorists must stop at all one-way intersections.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was run off the road by the Driver of an R+L Carriers Semi Truck and trailer  this morning at 9:43. I was traveling southbound on NE MLK in the easternmost lane. The driver came up behind me, well in excess of the speed limit, crossed multiple lanes without signalling and ran a fully red light in order to cut me off. Without speaking to him, I went on to the sidewalk to record his truck number to report the threatening and dangerous behavior, at which point the driver shouted " R and L Carriers, if you want it- you don't belong on the road!". The truck number is PS746.  I also recorded the trailer number and a photograph of the driver. This aggression on the road is completely unsafe and unjustifiable- all the lanes were open and this driver went out of his way and broke numerous traffic regulations to intimidate me.<br>

The car driver aggressively passed me on the left to cut me off even though there was a long line of cars waiting to cross Halsey in sight. The female passenger in the car screamed when she thought her driver was going to hit me.

I did not encourage this behavior or do anything in retaliation besides throw my hands in the air after I was safe.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Vista At bridge<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-17 13:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Myself and cycling friend was riding down Vista from Council Crest.  A BMW was stopped at a stop sign when we were about a hundred yards up the hill.  I saw the driver look then look the other direction.  A car was co9ming up the hill and the BMW accelerated, turning left!  I started screaming as by that time I was about 100 feet away.  We were graking full and I went behind the BMW and was able to stop within 25 feet past the car.  My riding partner impacted the BMW and destroyed the windshield, Right front fender, and hood of the BMW.  The carbon fiber frame was embedded in the fender.  My partner went over the car and landed in the middle of the intersection.  His right ankle was dislocated, a chunk the size of a palm print was torn from the inside of his right thigh and he had a cut on his right cheek below his eye.  I don;t know how his clavicle is but he woke up withing a minute.  
A sheriff deputy showed up within 20 seconds and was in contact with dispatch while I was on hold with 911.  He confirmed that an ambulance was on the way before 911 answered me on the cell phone.  3 police cars showed up and 2 motorcycle policemen arrived within a couple of minutes.  The ambulance arrived while everyone was exchanging information.  A nurse was there but the policemen were keeping My partner down.  He wanted up,  BTW he  is a doctor.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> N. Rosa Parks and N. Denver ave<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-10 20:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Vehicle headed Eastbound on rosa parks, stopped in the westbound left turn lane (to turn south into denver), turned left against stopped  westbound traffic, across multiple lanes and double yellow centerline into back parking lot of Ukiyoe Japanese restaurant.  I was headed westbound on RP, in bike lane, about to turn north onto Denver.  The vehicle slammed on its brakes as I veered right onto sidewalk up the driveway, narrowly missing being Tboned.

Incident occurred because: 
1. Driver insisted on making an illegal left turn
2. Stopped vehicles waved the vehicle across without regard to the moving bicycle traffic to their right.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Westbound driver of grey pickup truck fully intended to blow through the Washington stop sign to turn onto 14th, only slammed on the breaks when he noticed I was already in the crosswalk.

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Hawthorne and SE 10th Ave<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-16 17:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I heard a person yell, and then I came to the intersection of 10th and SE Hawthorne. The woman was sprawled on the ground next to the bike, and a couple of passers-by were attending to her. I heard a man, who later said he was the driver, saying "the lanes of traffic stopped for me, but she didn't stop. Apparently, he was crossing Hawthorne headed south on 10th Ave, and proceeded in front of the victim. From the damage on his car (Washington Lic: ANG3487, a grey sedan), it looks like she t-boned him as he cut her off. Fortunately, she stood up, and emergency vehicles appeared within a few minutes. This could easily have resulted in a death.

That intersection is dangerous, as cars headed south during rush hour may see cars yielding the intersection, but may not be able to see that there is a bike lane on the far right. No through traffic should be permitted there (detour to the light a block away) or at the very least there should be clear warning signs about the bike lane.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> S'bound NE Lloyd at NE Oregon<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-19 09:25:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> The bike lane  of S'bound Interstate Ave drops as it cross Oregon (Steel Bridge) and Interstate become Lloyd Blvd. There is a merge sign, but it is not widely noticed, IMO. This morning, I merged with plenty of room, but the GOld Volov wagon sped up, honking, and proceeded to pass dangerously close then cut me off. I caught up to the driver at MLK (of course) and watched him turn right on red w/o checking the sidewalk, then proceed to cross multiple lanes without signalling and turn left on Everett to access I-84. Lloyd needs sharrows and better signage, there should be no right on red at Lloyd and MLK, and cars wanting to access I-84 from LLoyd should be directed further east on Lloyd or at least to Davis so they can make safe and legal lane changes.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding north taking the full lane on the bike route that is Broadway (why isn't there a bike lane???). As happens on a monthly basis, a motorist started aggressively tailing me and honking even though I was going 20mph and there was a red light one block ahead. The next thing I remember was waking up in a hospital. This is VIOLENCE WITH INTENT TO KILL and a hit and run. The police response was pathetic - I was told later that *maybe* the car was frustrated with how slow I was going and was trying to go around me. NO. I have a bad head injury and have to alter my summer plans (first summer off in 8 years). PDX is NOT "bike friendly" and needs serious upgrading before I recommend that anyone bike commute here. No wonder our mode share has stagnated.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking South on NE 7th and an aggressive driver passed me in a no passing zone, but was unable to get back into the correct lane before the stop sign. Rather than slowing down to get back into the correct lane, they blew through the stop sign in the opposite lane and then swerved into the lane I was travelling in.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was patiently waiting at the stop sign of Tillamook, preparing to turn right onto N Williams. 

As I was turning, a driver who had been waiting at the opposing stop sign decided to turn left, directly into my path of travel.

The driver briefly stopped to let me go by. I caught up to the driver a few blocks later at a parking lot and spoke to her. She apologized, but I told her she needs to be more careful. She could have killed me. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Hawthorne and SE 7th Ave<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-25 12:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding east on Hawthorne and had the green light at SE 7th.  This section of roadway is slightly downhill coming off of the bridge so it is very easy to be doing 20 MPH or more.  As I entered the intersection, a driver who was northbound on SE 7th &amp; turning right on to Hawthorne (and had a red light and a green bike box) rolled into the bike lane without stopping behind the green box, coming to a stop blocking 2/3 of the bike lane.  Fortunately, with a little tail wind I was going about 25 (the speed limit there that almost no one obeys) and was able to quickly move out into the car lane.  I yelled and pointed to the green box but all the driver could manage was to speed by me and then, turn into the Burgerville lot at SE 12th.  Maybe he thought they were going to run out of fries!
When is PBOT and PPB going to figure out that these green boxes are a joke.  I live near the one at SE Lincoln and SE Cesar Chavez Blvd and I could write 10 tickets per hour during the busiest parts of the day.  It always amazes me how many drivers move to the front of the box when they have a red light even though they are making a left turn (of course, at all of these green boxes, right turns are prohibited on red, too.).  I would like to know how many tickets are written for green bike box violations.  PPB should do stings on green boxes.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Running a red light, Vehicle blocking bike lane, failure to stop behind green box and illegal turn where turn on red was prohibited by signage<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Barbur Blvd. and SW Hamilton<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-29 08:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> While proceeding northbound on SW Barbur Blvd. in the bike line, driver turned right onto SW Hamilton across my lane. He drove past me prior so he must have known I was there. He didn't signal until just a few feet prior to the turn. Because I had an inkling he might turn (he was drifting into the bike lane) I was able to stop in time. And although he had his windows rolled down and I started shouting as soon as he began to initiate the turn, he just kept right on going. 
This is a VERY common problem at this intersection. The bike lane really should be painted green at this intersection because the drivers just do NOT seem to notice it -- in spite of the huge amount of bike traffic on Barbur. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> A car was stopped in the bike lane because of a line for the underground parking lot. I considered going around the car, looked, signalled, then stopped myself.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was heading east on Pine. The light at Pine &amp; 4th was red, and there were several cars lined up waiting for the green. I pulled up behind a large flatbed truck, in the center of the lane.

Next thing I knew, the truck was backing in to me. I scrambled to get out of the way, and barely managed to do so.

My favorite part of the subsequent exchange: when asked &quot;what were you thinking,&quot; the driver responded with a a quip about how &quot;you guys are always breaking laws.&quot; I asked, &quot;Who are &quot;you guys&quot;? There are two of us in this interaction. You, and me. And you&#39;re the one who backed over me.&quot; It&#39;s amazing how some drivers just tar &amp; feather all cyclists.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I broke off from the naked bike ride to grab some refreshments. After turning onto Brooklyn, I noticed that one of the people in the group I was travelling with was still in the intersection and couldn't cross. She was trying to cross legally in the crosswalk on her bike, but no driver would stop for her. I rode my bike back into the intersection to stop traffic so she could cross but a driver (who appeared to be drunk) did not stop at first and had to slam on their brakes to avoid hitting me as I legally crossed the intersection with the right of way. 

The near collission was completely avoidable. If any of the drivers would have obeyed the crosswalk law, my friend would have safely made it across the intersection without any issues. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> N Interstate ave at Larrabee<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-06 09:05:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> A full size semi (tractor trailer) sped up behind to overtake me as I approached the Larrabee viaduct overpass on Southbound Interstate. There are some ambiguous signs indicating bikes may be on the road, but they are obscured by trees and calls to the City go unanswered. I was preparing to attempt a merge out of my lane (bike lane, because the bike lane disappears under the viaduct)  into the adjacent motor vehicle lane to avoid behind crushed between a vehicle and the viaduct column. The truck overtook me and proceeded to drift across the white line into the bike lane to the point where the right-most tire on the trailer was fully over the white line. I had braked hard after my head check and watched this truck over the exact spot I would have been on my bike if I had not been looking backwards in paranoia. After the truck cleared the overpass, I was slowly approaching and did another head check. A City of Portland vehicle had seen this and had slowed to a crawl to let me in. I have requested enforcefent (speeding, distracted driving, aggressive driving) for this location and requested engineering fixes but all the City has done is installed signs that motorists cannot see and do not appear to understand.   <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking north on Water Ave. As I approached the four-way stop at Yamhill, I merged left from the bike lane into the main traffic lane. I waited while the three or four cars in front of me on Water waited their turns and went through the intersection. Because I was planning to get on the Morrison Bridge path, I kept my left arm extended the entire time I was waiting to signal my intentions. When I got to the head of the line, I waited for all the cars that had arrived before me to proceed. I was almost through the intersection when a Subaru blew through the stop sign. I would have died if she hadn't jammed on her brakes at the last second. I am very attentive of all traffic patterns at an intersection, and I can assure you that this car had only just become visible around the corner of the Eastbank Plaza when I initially entered the intersection.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> As I approached the roundabout at 7th and Brazee, the driver behind me pulled left and sped toward the intersection to reach it before me.

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 11th and Hawthorne, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-10 18:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was part of a large group of cyclists heading east in the Hawthorne bike lane. My girlfriend was leading the group, about 20 meters ahead of me. I was the third in the group; another commuter was riding between my girlfriend and me. At 11th, a car with no turn signal turned right and almost collided with my girlfriend. The woman ahead of me split off to the left; as I entered the intersection, the driver who had almost hit my girlfriend lurched forward and almost hit me, too. Apparently almost hitting my girlfriend didn't make them think to check behind them.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was stopped at the stop sign at SE 67th &amp; SE Raymond street. I could see a car run the light at SE 67th avenue &amp; SE Foster in my mirror. The car came up behind me very fast after running the stop sign at Raymond. He then tried to pass dangerously despite lack of space. The driver backed off, as there wasn&#39;t enough space, then started following too closely. During this time, he accelerated a little too much and nearly hit my back wheel. I was biking about 20 mph at the time. I was very scared and moved over to the curb to get out of the road and off my bike, but the driver moved over too and passed very quickly about 6 inches off of me. The driver drove up a few feet and stopped. He then confronted me verbally, as I stood on the sidewalk with my bike. He finally drove away and I continued with my commute. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was driving south on 72nd Ave and stopped when the light turned red at Harold. An older gentleman started crossing in the crosswalk right in front of me. When he was halfway through the northbound lane of 72nd a woman in an SUV tried to turn left from Harold onto 72nd. Fortunately, she saw the man in the crosswalk in time and slammed on her brakes so hard they squealed. The man ran the rest of the way out of the crosswalk, clearly shaken. The woman was halfway across the westbound lane of Harold when she hit her brakes, so another car coming westbound had to wait for her to clear the intersection before proceeding.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Just after I passed 43rd Ave. heading toward Chavez, I saw a group of three cyclists heading in the opposite direction with a Subaru following close behind. I kept my eye on the Subaru, because dangerous passing is a daily occurrence on Clinton. Suddenly and without warning, the car swerved into my lane and started heading straight for me. I had to steer hard to the right, almost colliding with a parked car; the Subaru passed within a foot of my handlebar.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking East on Clinton St. when a man in a pickup pulled behind me (around 28th ave), laid on his horn, then pulled past me and matched my speed, yelling out his window at me and swerving back and forth, at one point coming within 18 inches of my handlebars. He then passed me, and pulled off and stopped just past 34th avenue. I explained Oregon's laws about passing bicycles safely, and he said that those laws don't exist and I was making them up. His speech was slurred, so I called the police to report him for drunk driving.<br>

I had been watching them approach me in the mirror. They were driving on the wrong side of the road at 35 mph from 48th avenue all the way to Cesar Chavez.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SEE Ladd Ave and SE Lavender St.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> <br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking SE down Ladd towards the stoplight at Division, when I heard the Suburban behind me pull around to try a pass. I was going 25 mph, and there was another car that had just turned off of Division and was heading NE in the opposing lane. Once I saw that there was oncoming traffic, I knew there was no way the Suburban could make the pass without causing a head-on collision. But he made the pass anyway! The other car had to slam on their brakes; the right taillight of the Suburban passed a foot from my handlebars.

The stoplight at Division was red, so I caught him seconds after he passed me. I tapped on his window and said that he had passed too close. He had given me only a foot, and the minimum passing distance is my fall height (6 ft). He said that he had been "completely in the other lane," and that I should ride further over. Again, I was riding 25 mph--the speed limit--and had I been riding any further over I would have risked getting doored by a person stepping out of a parked car. He then said to me:

    If you want to be a stickler for the rules, just remember that I'm driving a 7,000 pound vehicle, and you weigh maybe 180 pounds. That's your choice.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Hawthorne Blvd &amp; SE MLK Blvd<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-09 20:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking East on the bridge viaduct toward SE Hawthorne Boulevard. Right before the turnoff to 99E South, there are bollards blocking the cars from the bike lane. I noticed moving car approaching the bollards at a 90 degree angle. I looked over and saw that the driver was looking down at her phone and not paying any attention at all. I slammed on my brakes and yelled at her to stop. She stopped just before she would have hit the bollards. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE Multnomah and 14th ave, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-13 08:25:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Someone driving a large truck and turning right did not yield for someone on a bike who was going straight (Westbound). After nearly missing the first person on a bike, the driver continued their turn and nearly hit another person on a bike. After that person on the bike went through, the driver continued and nearly hit someone in a stroller. Then, someone from the opposing side (Eastbound), turned left right in front of the bus I was on, nearly hitting us and almost hit a 3rd person on a bike and the same person in the stroller. We shouldn't have this kind of shitty infrastructure that allows this behavior. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Naito Parkway &amp; SW Salmon Street<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-04-07 09:05:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I needed to move over from the bike lane to the left turn lane. Traffic was light, so I signaled a merge into the right lane (from the bike lane). A car let me in. A car was slowing to let me into the left lane after I signaled that merge. An late '90s white subaru wagon split the lane between the small sedan about to let me in and me to continue North on Naito. My left arm was grazed by their sideview mirror. Somehow, I didn't fall over, but my shoulder was injured and my upper arm was bruised. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Clinton St. and SE 49th Ave.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-04-17 17:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking east on Clinton St. at 20 mph--the speed limit--and approaching the intersection with 49th Ave. As I was biking, I had my eye on a black SUV that was making unsafe passes of the bikes behind me. Based on how quickly they caught up to me, they were probably going 10-15 mph above the speed limit. A northbound driver on 49th Ave turned left onto Clinton. The 49th Ave driver executed their turn just fine, putting me in no danger whatsoever. Unfortunately, the black SUV was passing me just as the 49th Ave driver completed their turn. Both drivers had to come to a complete stop to avoid a collision. I continued onward, and the SUV roared up behind me and drove *way* too close to my rear wheel right up until I got to the stop sign at 50th Ave, where they turned and I continued straight.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking east on Clinton, approaching 29th Ave. There was heavy bike traffic in both directions. A car was waiting to head south on 29th Ave. The car behind them started laying on their horn even though there was too much bike traffic for the car in front to proceed into the intersection. I kept an eye on the situation in my mirror. The first car turned right; the second card followed the first car through the intersection without even pretending to stop at the stop sign, and then turned left and roared up behind me. They yelled at me to get off the road, then started honking their horn, then passed within a foot of my handlebars even though I was going over 20 mph. They had Washington plates.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking west on Clinton, approaching the stop 34th ave. A woman was biking with a young boy, about 6 or 7 years old. The woman and the boy stopped at the stop sign at 34th, checked both ways, then proceeded into the intersection. Another woman on a bike, behind the boy but in front of me, blew through the stop sign and passed the little boy with only two feet to spare. She didn't announce her pass and he swerved to the right because she startled him. She was going about 18 mph, which could seriously injure a 6 year old if she misjudged her pass--and she left herself without much margin for error.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Eastbound on Vermont in the bike lane, woman driving a kia box, while looking at phone in hand, started turning right onto Bertha without a signal across the bike lane just after the light turned green as I was rolling up alongside with my 4yo son on a trailer bike.  She had just passed us less than 30 seconds ago on the way down the hill (and appears to have been speeding down to the red light.)  If I had not suspected that she may turn right (because many drivers do here), noticed her car cheated slightly to the right, approached with extra caution, and shouted "hey!" as she started turning, she would have hit us (perhaps if I missed any one of these items.)<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-14 23:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Driver revved the engine and honked the horn just as the red pickup came alongside me, intentionally threatening me by crowding the bike lane despite an extra lane available to their left.  They then sped south along Barbur at 60mph or more.  This was intentional harassment on a dark stretch of road where many people do not feel safe biking and the bike lane is often littered or missing while the traffic lanes are far too wide and speeding at 10mph over is the norm.  One might suspect from the time of night that the driver was at least partly drunk.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> 7529 SW Barbur Blvd, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-16 00:58:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> The driver of a blue chrysler minivan 129hek turned in front of me across the bike lane without signaling into the entrance of the Fred Meyer immediately after the Bertha intersection (westbound on Barbur.)  We had both just been stopped at a red light and had started moving at the same time, so he had to have known I was there.  While stopped, he appeared to be petting a dog (not in a carrier) in the passenger seat.  The right rear turn signal was visibly damaged around the edges and had blue car wash tape on it (as did the rear wiper -- they do this at the kaady wash at Barbur and Terwilliger.)  The signal may not have been working, but I didn't see a front turn signal blink either.  The turn across the bike lane may have been legit with a signal, but I had to hit my brakes (going downhill at ~18mph by then) and the driver had accelerated hard to pass me from the light.  Any complications at the sidewalk or in the driveway to the parking lot could have been dangerous at this speed, where waiting for me to pass or giving me time to trade lane positions would have taken a couple seconds at most.  If I had not noticed the tape, the dog, and known that the fred meyer turn is a popular right hook location, I could have been hit.  This turn requires drivers to cross a bike lane and sidewalk with no turn lane and with aggressive Barbur Blvd traffic behind them charging toward the "open road" with a long view toward no red lights until they crest the next hill.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Riding in the bike lane on Rosa Parks and there's a car with WA plates parked in the lane at the bus stop. Annoying, but I check over my shoulder and it's clear, so I move into the car lane to go around.

I think she's seen me and I start moving again. Just then she hits the gas and with no signal, peels out right in front of me, squealing her tires and missing me by a foot or two.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 7th and Multnomah, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-15 08:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding Westbound on NE Multnomah, when a driver nearly right-hooked me, turning onto NE 7th Ave.  He had been waiting for a pedestrian to cross the crosswalk, and then did not wait for me.  We both stopped, his bumper inches from my foot, and he has the nerve to motion for me to move out of the intersection.  He also yelled and said I was a "weirdo".<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Marquam Hill Rd and SW Gibbs St<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-16 07:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Incident of very unsafe passing during my daily commute to OHSU. 

I was riding downhill on SW Marquam Hill Rd at the point where it becomes SW Gibbs St. I had taken the lane, since this is a blind curve to the right and there are often pedestrians walking down the hill to OHSU. I was probably going 22-23 mph on this 25-mph road. The vehicle behind me suddenly accelerated, swerved halfway into the lane of oncoming traffic to pass me, nearly missed hitting a car in the oncoming lane (driver of which honked their horn), and then swerved back into the lane in front of me to avoid hitting the other car.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to catch up to the offending vehicle or get the license number. It was a white SUV with Washington plates, 7 characters (no hyphen), first 3 AYD?

This is a steep, winding road that is heavily trafficked by cars, bikes, and pedestrians all sharing the lane with no shoulder. Drivers are generally courteous, patient, and cognizant of the fact that passing is very dangerous on the curves. No one was hurt this time, but this driver's action was incredibly stupid and reckless and could have ended very badly.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> car passed oncoming cyclist, crossing double yellow, into oncoming lane in which I occupied.  car did not slow when I  was in center of lane. I had to dive to gutter to avoid head on collision.  OHSU needs to do more to discourage unsafe commuting to their campus.  PBOT needs to do more to discourage unsafe driving. SW Fairmount needs slower speeds, more signage, and speed bumps. Too many walkers, joggers, and cyclists are on this road to allow people to drive so fast. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> As I was crossing this 3-way stop (northbound), the driver of a car on my right started moving into the intersection without looking up.

<b>What happened?:</b> The driver was in the right hand lane that was supposed to merge into the left lane. Most drivers were alternating- a driver in the left lane would let one right lane driver in front of them and then drive forward. I let one right hand lane driver on front of me and started forward. The driver immediately to the right sped up and started merging. I honked thinking they didn't notice, but they continued merging left into where I was, attempting to drive me off the road!
The car was a black Lexus SUV with an Oregon license plate starting in 888, and then may have been LMT, but not sure of the last three.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking east on Clinton, approaching the traffic circle at 23rd Ave. A huge white van roared up alongside me and tried to force their way between me and the traffic circle. I was terrified, I honestly thought I was about to die. There was no path at all through the intersection that didn't involve running me over, and up to the last second I was convinced that they were going to. I had two near-death experiences in less than 10 minutes on my ride home! Drivers like these need to be banned from the road, permanently. Someone is going to die.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW 5th Ave and SW Yamhill St<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-20 17:47:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking south on 5th Ave. Just after the light at Morrison turned green, a huge red pickup pulled up behind me. Even though I was going 15 mph--faster than the 12 mph signal timing on that road--the driver illegally pulled partway into the bus only lane and passed me. He was less than 3 feet away through the entire pass because he was straddling the line between the general traffic lane and the bus lane. He wasn't even halfway through his pass when he started drifting to the left. His window was opening and I was screaming and banging on the side of the truck (yes, he really was that close), but he kept passing. His rear bumper passed inches away from my front wheel. Then he brake-checked me, because the light was still red. We had to wait for probably five seconds at the light! This guy broke at least three different traffic laws (illegally entering the bus mall, inadequate passing distance, inadequate merging distance) and almost killed a person, and for what? At Taylor there were two cars at the red light. I value my life more than some asshole getting to be third in light at a red light instead of fourth. Don't you?<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was walking my bike across SW 6th Ave, using the southern crosswalk. I was walking just behind another person, also walking a bike. We had to jump to the side to avoid being hit by a man in an Escalade. His vehicle came to a stop more than halfway through the crosswalk. He was illegally driving in one of the transit lanes, and he had his right turn signal on so I stopped and pointed at the "No Turns" sign (https://www.google.com/maps/@45.519748,-122.678248,3a,75y,359.46h,98.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCSjdfbrtBDiPOI_bsLXtUw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), but he refused to make eye contact with me. He broke at least four traffic laws (driving in the transit-only lanes, making a right turn from a center lane, failure to obey a traffic control device, failure to obey a no turns sign) and almost killed two people. Drivers like this need to be kept off the road.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was running north on 60th Ave with my girlfriend. When we were crossing Ramona St., a car approaching from the east blew through the stop sign and almost ran us over. I am always very aware of my surroundings and I saw this car approaching from hundreds of feet away, and they did not slow down at the stop sign in the slightest. We were almost into the westbound lane when they collided with us.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking eastbound on Harrison. A Pizzicato delivery vehicle (Kia Soul- type car) came up behind me. There was a small gap in parked cars (two parking spots in a row were open), and the driver cut into the parking space and then cut immediately out of the parking spot to attempt passing me on the right (I was going 15 mph up the hill, which is only 5 mph under the speed limit on a greenway). There wasn't enough space and due to my speed (I was going way faster than they expected) and had to move into oncoming traffic to avoid getting run over. There were cars heading West, which slowed down, but the Pizzicato car only gave me less than a foot of passing space while pulling this maneuver. They then braked, drove under the speed limit for a few feet and pulled into their destination--St. David's of Wales church.   <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was on a run with my boyfriend when we stopped at the signal at SE 52nd &amp; SE Reedway street. A car pulled into the bike lane and partially into the crosswalk. She did not pull in close to the curb so not only was she blocking the bike lane, but half of the car lane too, forcing cars to move into oncoming traffic to pass. 

The light changed and we got a walk signal. We checked for reverse lights and to make sure the driver would keep the car stopped before proceeding. As soon as we were behind her car she hit the gas and almost reversed over us. There was no warning, but no better place to cross. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking east on Lincoln. A car came up behind me after the signal at 50th, right at the intersection 51st they decided to pass me.

<b>What happened?:</b> Another near-miss on my commute to OHSU. I was riding down SW Gibbs, bus headed northward on SW 11th turned right onto Gibbs in front of me. I slowed down a bit and continued on behind the bus. A few moments later, just before the Plaid Pantry, a Jeep coming in the opposite direction started to turn left and nearly hit me. It stopped in time (a few feet away from me), I swerved around and kept going. Not sure if the car was coming up Gibbs/Sam Jackson or out of the Plaid Pantry -- I was focused on the bus in front of me, and apparently so was the Jeep driver.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking west on Woodward, came to the stop sign at 62nd Ave, stopped, then proceeded into the intersection. A driver going south on 62nd ran the stop sign and almost hit me.

Failing to come to a complete stop at that particular stop sign is completely unacceptable. There is a five-foot tall hedge abutting the NE corner of the intersection, making it literally impossible to see other vehicles at the intersection unless you are all the way up to the stop sign. The driver this morning was either a complete idiot or knew full well she was risking a collision and ran the stop sign anyway.<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-30 09:50:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking west across the Hawthorne Bridge, approaching a slower cyclist who was biking along the right (railing-side) half of the path. When I was about 15 m behind the slower cyclist, she moved to the left because a pedestrian was coming in the opposite direction (east). The slower cyclist took a position in the middle of the path (5 ft from the road, 5 ft from the deck). It was not safe for me to pass, so I took up a position behind her and to her left, with my front wheel slightly behind her back wheel, 4 ft from her position and 1 ft from the roadway. As we were passing the pedestrian, another cyclist came up from behind and tried to force his way through the gap between us. He only stopped because I shouted at him to knock it off. Because of the space between me and the slower cyclist, it would have been physically impossible for this idiot to thread the gap between us: he would have knocked me into traffic, or her into the pedestrian, or both.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking north up 67th Ave, and stopped at the red light at Foster.

The truck roared into the intersection, passing my front handlebars with only three feet and my back wheel with even less. Four cars had stacked up behind me at the light, so this truck was also risking a collision with all of those cars by failing to yield. I heard several cars behind me honk.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 67th Ave and SE Woodstock Blvd<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-29 19:58:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was going south on 67th Ave, approaching the stop sign at Woodstock Blvd. When I was about 20 m from the stop sign, a green SUV came around the corner, passing less than 2 ft from the curb on the right side of the street. I was only able to avoid a head-on collision by steering hard to the left. At the speed the driver was going, I think making a turn tight enough to avoid encroaching on my lane would have caused his vehicle to tip over.

Approaching traffic on 67th is completely obscured by 6647 SE Woodstock (see google street view below), so this driver was grossly negligent. He whipped around the corner even though he literally could not see what was on the other side. This is the second time today I've almost been run over by a driver who couldn't even be bothered to check around a blind corner.

Despite my best efforts, they still nearly ran me over by trying to execute a U-turn at high speed right when I was in the middle of the intersection.

Again: no turn signal, no flashers, no movement at all until I was in the intersection, then they almost ran me over.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I turned left from SE 21st Ave in order to go east on Clinton St. A driver in a VW ran the stop sign and started following me way to close and revving his engine even though my speed was perfectly matched to the car in front of me. He kept pulling to the left to pass even though I was only two car lengths back from the car in front of me, but he couldn't pass because of heavy bike and car traffic in the other direction. He passed me (WAY too close!) at 27th Ave, even though there was a Chevy Suburban approaching in the other direction and less than a block away. There was heavy bike and car traffic in both directions, but he did the same thing to all the other riders in front of me: revving his engine, passing too close, passing despite oncoming traffic, brake checking. He also ran the stop sign at 34th. Despite all his dangerous passes, I was able to get into the bike box ahead of him at Chavez. He endangered the lives of at least 20 different people so that he could spend 3 more seconds at a stoplight than I did. Drivers like him can't be allowed on the road.<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-03 17:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding westbound on Clinton toward 45th, where there is a small traffic circle with stop signs on 45th (no stop signs for traffic on Clinton). I attempted to proceed through the intersection, when a vehicle approached from the north on 45th ave. The vehicle did not come to a stop at the stop sign, and turned LEFT at the traffic circle instead of RIGHT, which is not legal. I skidded to a stop, coming very close to colliding with the dark-colored sedan. I was thrown from my bicycle and landed on my right side pretty hard, getting bruises on my right hip, knee, and elbow. My bike was slightly damaged with scratches on the frame, rack, handlebars, and rear deraillier, and my front disc brake rotor was slightly bent. The driver stopped to see if I was okay, but I told her to leave because I was not able to speak civilly at the time, then yelled to watch where she was going as she drove off. I did not report it because I didn't think anything could be done about it, but next time I will. There were witnesses both on foot and in a vehicle stopped at the south side of the traffic circle on 45th, but I did not get their contact information because I was too shaken from the accident.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Left-hook (oncoming driver at intersection turns in front of cyclist's path), Failing to stop for a stop sign, Inattentive driver, Turning left at traffic circle<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking southbound on 7th Ave. About 50-ft after I passed through the signal at Knott Street, the motorist coming from behind passed me, coming within about 1-ft of my handlebars. I was controlling the lane for my safety as 7th is narrow and has parked cars. I yelled out to the driver that he almost hit me. He stopped his car. I waited behind, not responding. He then gave me the finger through his sunroof and continued on his way. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 28th and Clinton, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-08-11 17:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding east on Clinton when a person driving a sea-green Prius passed me going around 30 mph less than two feet away. He proceeded to do the same to every other person riding bikes up the street. When I caught up to him at the light at 39th, I knocked on his window to let him know he'd been driving too fast and passing to close. The person driving, a middle-aged guy with a white beard, responded by waving a wooden bat at me. I shouted some unpleasantries, flipped him off, and rode away.

The city needs to hurry up and build diverters, or at least start enforcing speed limits and safe driving on Clinton. No amount of signs along the boulevard—much as I appreciate them—is going to stop the deluded drivers who think they can save a few seconds by using Clinton instead of Powell or Division.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding west on Atlantic Ave, and in the intersection with Central Avenue to make a shallow left turn on to Central Avenue, signaling left and waiting for oncoming traffic to  let up so I could turn.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was proceeding south on Hawthorne in the bike lane when a dark colored sedan (license plate 629 GEV) overtook me in the lane to my left. As the car pulled abreast of me, the female driver began laying on the horn, obviously upset but it was unclear if it was directed at me or the driver she was tailgating. I had a green light to proceed straight through the intersection, but just as I was about to enter the intersection she abruptly swerved right across my path to turn westbound onto Center St. I was forced to brake hard and narrowly avoided colliding with the side of her car.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Leaving my driveway I did my normal left-right-left check of our little street.

I pulled over in a neighbor&#39;s driveway because I didn&#39;t think the driver had slowed down enough. The driver took off and continued onto SE Clinton and then southbound on SE 26th, confirming that this was another cut-through driver that doesn&#39;t care to drive safely near Piccolo Park (a regular occurrence). The vehicle was a gray Honda Civic, OR plate 276 FBL.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Corbett and Nebraska, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-01 08:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Northbound on Corbett, I arrived at the stop sign one second before a car which was westbound on Nebraska rolled halfway past the stop sign before pausing and as I was entering the intersection, I slowed to see if she was going to stop.  She then began turning left through the intersection and directly toward me, stopping only after I screamed.  I couldn't see through the glare on the windshield, but I believe she was looking only to her right because southbound traffic does not have a stop sign.  I was on the western leg of the split street and I think she was turning onto that leg.

I don't know how she didn't see us.  I had 3 headlights on, my son was on the back of the bike with a brightly colored helmet.  We were clearly visible as she approached the stop sign (and never stopped) and right in front of her as she started into the intersection.  I can only imagine that she really just didn't look.

This split + tee intersection is confusing for many drivers as they don't realize there are three stop signs or that both of the split streets are two-way traffic.  There are at least three schools which get drop-off traffic through here, much of which is coming and going from Barbur past Fulton Park.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW corbett and Custer, Portland OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-02 13:14:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> A driver passed me approaching this intersection and turned right from the left side of the road without a signal cutting just in front of me.  This exact maneuver happened to me here twice today (2 different drivers.)  As I'm travelling south (uphill) on an electric bike at around 15mph (a rather casual pace, *not* full speed), drivers commonly misjudge my speed and pass illegally approaching the intersection.  This driver, (who had just pulled out of a driveway on Custer) turned the corner into the left side and sped away up the street.  He could not have had been able to see if the way was clear before the turn or starting the pass.  My 4yo son was on the back of the bike with me.

The common route is to turn right (west) up Custer to access Barbur and drivers are always racing through here, generally not signalling turns or obeying stop signs, making it difficult and dangerous for people biking or walking in crosswalks.  The corners at Corbett+Custer and Brier+Miles are dead end and low-volume streets which are basically ignored (as far as using turn signals or assuming right of way) by people driving the main route to and from Barbur.

Speeding 5-10mph over 25 is too common on this route and seems to be rewarded by the timing of the signal at Miles to cross Barbur -- the first vehicle to arrive generally gets a quick and short green (within 20s, lasting 2.5s), which leaves anyone who wasn't speeding+tailgating waiting a full minute for the next cycle.<br>

A second car tailgated (1s gap) the first, arriving at the crest of the hill on the left side of the road.  There is no visibility over this crest and this creates a very dangerous situation for a person biking up the hill.  My 4yo son was on the bike with me.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 28th and Glisan<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-04 13:31:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling southbound on NE 28th ave a block or 2 north of glisan when the suspect "buzzed" me while accelerating rapidly.

as I approached the intersection where there was a red light and a handful of vehicles waiting to proceed, I rolled up to approach the intersection to the right of the waiting vehicles.

It was at this point the suspect jerked the wheel of his car to the right (not by much, but obviously with intent) as if to block my path. I continued past the vehicle and then the suspect started screaming threats, calling me a "fucking faggot" telling me to get out of the road and saying I'm lucky he doesn't hit me.

It was at this time I pulled in front of the vehicle as the light was turning green and it was natural for me to pull back into the lane and re-join traffic. The driver proceeded to yell and make threats, even as I was keeping up with the traffic in front of me as we proceeded through the intersection.

As the parking lane to the right of the traffic lane went away, the suspect quickly passed me on the right through the intersection and continued to yell obscenities and threats.

During most of this time I was working on getting my phone out to try to capture a picture of the suspect and the suspect vehicle. When I finally got my phone out he was about half a block further south of me on 28th. Upon seeing me pull out my phone he proceeded to turn right onto NE flanders (proceeding westbound). I turned the corner to hopefully capture a picture of the suspect for police.

It was at this time he pulled his car over, parked, got out and approached me with violent intent. Since I was in photo taking mode on my phone and not video, I don't have video of the start of this, but I have video of him leaving, screaming obscenities, making threats, and a solid capture of his face, voice, and vehicle identification.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w0bdccliyt51sug/AACElJjcQVXgpLWpFWjcoofxa?dl=0 photos and video of driver and vehicle. Sadly, no video of the incident itself.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was northbound on Corbett with my 4yo on the bike when a car passed me and the driver immediately had to slam on her brakes because a truck had just pulled out from the curbside parking (the driver of the truck pulled out without a signal.)  The car (a tan honda sedan, WDA374) had been speeding and coming up aggressively close behind me while approaching the stop sign on Custer before turning onto Corbett.  I believe she was cutting-through the neighborhood to bypass I5 traffic because she continued north, tailgating the truck up Corbett past Carolina.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Champoeg Rd NE and Case Rd NE, Aurora, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-13 17:40:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding north on the Willamette Scenic Bikeway towards Champoeg St. Park. At this intersection the bikeway follows the main road as it turns left. Traffic approaching from the east has a stop sign, while the main road curves around the corner. A pickup truck pulled up to the stop sign just as I was going through the intersection. I cleared the intersection and headed west on Champoeg Rd, which had several cars in the eastbound lane coming towards me. With no shoulders and a narrow lane, I rode in the center of the lane as there was not room for a safe pass. The driver of the black, jacked up Ford pickup truck gunned the engine and forced me off the road, passing very closely and nearly hitting me. I gave the driver a wave as they went by, which apparently made them angry, as they slammed on the brakes and started reversing at high speed back towards me. At this point I turned around and pedaled the other direction, seeking to avoid an altercation. The driver finally took off and left. Unfortunately I did not catch the license plate, or else I would have immediately reported the incident to police.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Water Ave and SE Tilikum Way<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-14 10:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> As I left the bike box to get on the Tilikum bridge, a cyclist crossed my path at high speed, missing me by inches. He was running a red light but he yelled at me.

Incidentally, this bike box is a really dangerous design. Using it requires a cyclist to either make a turn across train tracks or make an extremely tight turn just after crossing them, all the while keeping one hand off the handlebar to signal a left turn. This is a maneuver that very, very few cyclists would be able to carry out.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> 7534 SW Brier Pl, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-05 13:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Heading south on Brier PL over I5, drivers often pass me on this downhill into a left turn onto Custer (with a 10mph advisory sign) where I'm travelling at least 20mph in a 25 -- this means they are speeding, driving on the left over a blind hill, then braking and forcing their way in front of me and speeding into the blind corner.  This has happened twice in the past week, once by a pizza hut delivery driver (561faf prius) when I was already held-up behind a line of 5 cars at rush hour and today with a full sized painter's van (541fhk - franklin painting 503-730-5861) while a pedestrian was walking next to the guardrail on Custer.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Travelling south on Terwilliger, approaching the end of the bike lane (and heading downhill at near 20mph with my kid on the back of the bike), a car came over the hill behind me at what sounded like at least 35mph.  I signaled left, and the driver didn't reduce speed.  I signaled again as the car was getting too close for comfort and the driver swung left as the road narrows, barely getting back to the right before oncoming traffic coming around the curve at 7th.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Driver tailgated me while biking 23-24mph in a 25 zone legally in the lane, all the way from Sandy to Flanders southbound on NE 28th. I stopped for pedestrians to cross in a marked crosswalk. The driver then, while pedestrians were in front of me, honked angrily, and when I turned around she threw her head out her window and shouted "Why the fuck are you stopping? Get off the road! You're taking up the whole fucking lane!" and more obscenities. Once the pedestrians had cleared the crosswalk I continued, and the driver continued to tailgate and menacingly rev her engine all the way down 28th. She angrily sped off onto NE Couch, then flew through the Whole Foods parking lot endangering many people, sped down Burnside, and made a very dangerous turn onto NE 28th northbound. She then illegally stopped at the NE Couch intersection, got out of her car, and began freaking out before returning to her car and driving off at a high rate of speed.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I observed a northbound pedestrian crossing NW Lovejoy at NW 15th in an unmarked legal crosswalk during a break in traffic. A Blue Subaru with a white male driver in mid 40s was approaching in the far lane (westboound) as the pedestrian was in the middle of the street. The vehicle speed was perceptibly too fast for the street. The driver waited until the last second and slammed on his brakes causing tires to skid. The vehicle came to a stop just 1 or 2 meters from the person crossing the street. The driver then proceeded to verbally chastise the person after they finished crossing the street. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I and one other person were biking eastbound after dark on N Willamette since it is listed as a bicycle friendly street on Google maps. (But due to car speeds and driver behavior, its not.)  With no other traffic in either direction, a dark Saturn or similar vehicle approached from behind. Driver began honking at such a far distance to our rear we did not know it was directed at us. Driver continued to honk the horn until he was directly behind us. With a dashed yellow line separating the lanes and no oncoming traffic, there was nothing preventing the driver from a safe and legal pass. The driver finally passed safely, after more honking.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 43rd Ave and SE Clinton St.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-22 18:25:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking eastbound on SE Clinton. Two cars were driving in my lane to pass some cyclists on the hill. This was nearly a head-on collision. Because it was two cars together, it either would have been a pile-up or two cars running right over me.

ORS 811.410(1)(c) states:
The driver of a vehicle shall not drive to the left side of the center of the roadway in overtaking and passing a vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless the left side is **clearly visible** and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completed without interfering with the operation of a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction or a vehicle overtaken.

There is a hill on Clinton between 45th Ave and 43rd. This hill makes it impossible for a driver to determine whether the left-hand side is free of oncoming traffic, as required by ORS 811.410(1)(c). Even if I was not coming in the other direction, it *still* would have been illegal for those drivers to pass those bikes there.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Passing without sufficient space, Wrong side of road<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 22nd Ave and SE Clinton St.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-24 17:37:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was approaching the traffic circle at 22nd Ave, eastbound. A bicyclist came out of the traffic circle in the other direction. A car came through behind them, then pulled into my lane and nearly collided with me while trying to pass the cyclist. I honked my bike horn at her for driving on the wrong side of the road, but she honked back as if nearly killing people by driving on the wrong side of the road is a God-given right.

Regardless of whether I was there, it would have been illegal for the driver to pass where she did, because the landscaped traffic circle and the inflection point in the hill at 22nd Ave means that the oncoming lane of traffic is not clearly visible as required by 811.410(1)(c).<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding southbound in the bike lane on Polk when a driver pulled his car into the bike lane next to me.

<b>Where were you?:</b> NW Skyline and US Hwy 26<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-01 16:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was proceeding westbound through the crosswalk with a green light and the walk sign on.  A driver in a white Volvo station wagon heading south on Skyline with a red stop light did not stop his car until he passed almost completely through the crosswalk.  He did not even look to his left to see me until I was right next to his car.  If I were new to this intersection, I would have been hit by his car, but luckily I have a lot of experience with drivers failing to stop before they reach the crosswalk here, since I witness drivers doing this about 1/3rd of the time.  This situation is caused by poor infrastructure that allows drivers to turn on red in a location where it is clearly dangerous to the walking/biking traffic.  Drivers should be forced to stop a few feet before they reach the crosswalk.  <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I yielded for one group of pedestrians as I was heading eastbound on SE Clinton St at 25th. I came to a complete stop to let them cross, and while I was waiting another group came up to crosswalk to cross. They were about to walk when an impatient driver behind me passed on my left to get to the light at 26th faster. If pedestrians were 2 seconds earlier they could have been hit. I caught up to driver at Chavez diverter (note that the impatient driver was using Clinton as a cut through to upper division) and knocked on their window and received the middle finger in turn. When I told him he nearly hit people when he illegally passed me, he told me "like hell I did."<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> The light turned green on Glisan. A few seconds later a driver in white GM sedan (Oldsmobile or Pontiac, I think) realized that we would not make the left turn onto Glisan. He proceeded to swerve in front of me while in the intersection, then head straight from the left turn lane to continue onto 53rd. He didn't have space in front of him to complete the manuever and brake checked me pretty hard, luckily I could stop before I rear-ended him. 

The driver needed to have used the left turn lane to turn left and not swung over to go straight through the intersection. It isn't legal to change lanes in intersections and you are supposed to signal. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 12th and Powell<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-19 18:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was going straight. The driver made a right turn into my lane without seeing me. It wasn't raining, it wasn't that dark.

I could have had my lights on, and more reflective gear.

My back tire was crunched. The driver was kind to drive me home. I filed a police report. Costs to the accident still came up about 2 months later. I tried riding a summer event and the back tire burst a few times. The driver graciously paid for the first couple expenses of about $120, but ignored my last one of $60. 

Fix: Cops could mention on the roads, with a road sign that it's a high traffic accident area. Driver commented she would benefit from more driver education programs on bicycling around the city.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NW 18th and Quimby<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-01 18:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding as usual NB in the bike lane of NW 18th Ave.  A car came EB on NW Quimby and blew thru its stop sign.  Didn't even slow.  Almost hit me.  I slammed on the brakes and avoided the collision, barely.  It is the second time this year I've seen drivers blow across NW 18th Ave at one of the cross streets that doesn't have a stop line painted.  I'd like to see stop lines (aka stop bar) painted so that a driver who doesn't see the stop sign has some other cue to stop.  Stop signs in this area often are obstructed by a tall truck of van parked in front of it, or a tree branch obstructing it, so stop lines would be a great safety improvement.    <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> After traveling west on the Sunset Bike Path I moved to Canyon Ct in order to continue my commute on SW 61st.

<b>What happened?:</b> Traveling westbound on Butner, a truck nearly struck me first with his rear view mirror, then nearly with his trailer.   The road curves to the right and is also on a hill.  The driver was concerned with being hit if an oncoming car appeared.  The road had no bike lane or road markers for bikes due to a recent repaving.  However, incidents like this happen too frequently. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Hawthorn and SE 7th<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-06 21:40:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Riding down Hawthorne late at night after class with lights. I need to turn left on 7th in order to get to Salmon Street Bike Boulevard so I change lanes as I usually do from the bike lane in the right to the left lane to turn. I had a clear merge so I performed it (not a lot of traffic that night). Then I notice very quickly a pair of lights are right behind me. I turn my head and a car is barrelling down on me, tailgating me. My guess is he was 5-7 feet away, which is way too close for comfort. I swerve to the left (no cars parked at this hour) and he drives by me and flips me off. 

This is already an unsafe street/intersection. I don't know what this guys' problem was, but it made everything much more unsafe. The intersection at 7th and Hawthorne could definitely use a turn bike box. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> This happens nearly every day on this corner for myself and neighbors needing to ride to work from our homes only yards away from this location.  Cars traveling from Murray to Cedar hills (short cut to westbound 26hw) take this corner around cyclists too closely for fear of moving into the other lane on a blind corner.  I love this neighborhood, and HATE this road.  There is good bike infrastructure that local residents are attempting to reach safely.  Sections of road like this are getting worse and putting peoples lives at risk. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Bike commuting east on SE Salmon St. at SE 10th Ave ... Car driving north on SE 10th Ave failed to stop at stop sign. Driver inattention was due to 'fiddling with navigation device' (GPS?).
I grabbed rear brake handle, locked rear tire which slid me 90 degrees left to my direction of travel and parallel to nearly stopped vehicle in middle of intersection. I impacted the car in the area of the left front fender/driver's door making a graceless landing on hood hood of vehicle. 
I was OK (no evident injuries), bicycle was undamaged, her car suffered damage with scratched and dented hood and broken rear-view mirror.
The driver stated she was at fault and ran the stop sign due to distraction of navigation device.
Since I was uninjured (my own assessment) We went our separate ways ... with me offering the advice ... "PLEASE be careful".<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I unexpectedly had to enter the regular stream of traffic when I came upon two cars parked in the bike lane. I couldn't move to the sidewalk as there weren't any. The cars had "For Sale" signs on them. I left polite but informative notes on their windshields alerting them to the fact that they had illegally and dangerously parked their vehicles in a bike lane. 

Added note: Coming upon vehicles stopped in bike lanes became much more prevalent once using cell phones in moving vehicles became unlawful. Drivers regularly pull over into bike lanes to use their phones and apparently aren't aware that crossing over and stopping in a bike lane is also unlawful.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I am a crippled old man who walks badly with a cane.  I was a pedestrian in the crosswalk with my "walk light" on.  Westbound Madison St had a RED light.  I was nearly run down by a speeding bicycle which was rapidly passing a curbed bus to run the red light.  I instinctively poked at the cyclist with my cane, then poked at him again to get more space for myself as he swerved closely past me to run the light.

 He never slowed down until he was across the street when he stopped in anger because I had defended myself.  He apparently was outraged that I had declined to jump out of his way.   I yelled that he had run a red light, and he yelled back that I had a fat ass; I've heard that before, since I was four years old, and it is not news.  Having a broken spine takes all of the fun out of exercise.

The self-important bicyclist himself was nearly killed.  Not from running the light, but by me.  The fact that  the bus full of witnesses was there  deterred me from pulling out my sword-cane and letting him impale himself on it!  Or else I simply would have shot him, but ironically I was not packing that morning.

Idiot bicyclists should beware of old crippled men in crosswalks:  they don't have much to lose and simply will not be insulted by morons.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 28th and Glisan<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-08 07:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Toyota Tacoma with topper OR License plate 123 GVT passed me very closely with on coming traffic. I was northbound on 28th in the middle of the lane (taking the lane) and this truck passed me with the mirrors barely missing my handle bars as a car was southbound. He had to speed up quickly (floored it) to barely get back in the lane and his rear bumper a foot or two in front of my bike when he merged back. He was caught at the red light at Glisan less than a block away<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 12th and Powell<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-19 18:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was going straight. The driver made a right turn into my lane without seeing me. It wasn't raining, it wasn't that dark.

I could have had my lights on, and more reflective gear.

My back tire was crunched. The driver was kind to drive me home. I filed a police report. Costs to the accident still came up about 2 months later. I tried riding a summer event and the back tire burst a few times. The driver graciously paid for the first couple expenses of about $120, but ignored my last one of $60. 

Fix: Cops could mention on the roads, with a road sign that it's a high traffic accident area. Driver commented she would benefit from more driver education programs on bicycling around the city.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> N Willams &amp; N Stanton<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-05-21 19:46:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b>  Five years ago I suffered a traumatic brain injury. Luckily I was wearing my helmet. Having had a traumatic brain injury I always wear my helmet to begin with. Especially now.

     I was riding North in the bike lane on Williams, there was a car pulling out of a parking lot. The car would had to turn left because Williams is a one way north. The car freaked, only to make sure the coast was clear for its self. It did not see me and T boned me. I rode in the ambulance to the ER, which was close. At the ER I found out that I (not me but the idiot driver) had broken my collar bone...
   I had just started a new job. A new job that I could no longer do with a  broken collar bone.

I had to call work an explain. 

I went and got my bike looked at... The frame was bent! It was going to be more cost effective to buy a brand new bike than try to fix the one I had.

The drivers insurance company are ass holes! OF COURCE the drivers story is different from mine. He says I flipped him off and that I HIT HIM.

The insurance company has pain for nothing. NO hospital bills. 
NO NOTHING.

I had to argue for them to replace my bike! Which should have been done willingly! AT that I was sent a letter that I was to sign releasing the driver of all of the things that he did. The letter also said that I would not pursue any accusations against the driver. 

NO WAY

I  told the insurance company I would not sign it and called my lawyers.Now October, I still have no bike but things are in the works with  my lawyers.



ADVOID: COUNTRY FINANCIALAL - They are such dicks.

<b>What happened?:</b> Cars moving around this bend in the road cheat into the bike lane in order to cut the curve shorter.  Problem is, sometimes there is a cyclist in the bike lane.  This road has a bend in this spot and a few others like it, and the bike lane is narrow here, with a storm drain.  Cars speeding by and drifting into the bike lane.  If they slow down, they can pass safely and keep in their own lane.  <br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2014-07-15 18:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was crossing Holgate at the intersection of 41st/42nd and Holgate. 41st/42nd is a major bike corridor and there is no signage alerting drivers on Holgate of this fact, nor are there any safety concessions for cyclists at this crossing. I was on Holgate, eastbound, at 42nd and clearly signalled that I was turning left onto 42nd to head north. A driver approached from behind and sped up as they did so. As I began to turn left onto 42nd, the driver passed me on my left. I was sideswiped by the vehicle and was knocked to the ground. I could have been seriously injured or killed by the vehicle if the timing had been a fraction of a second different. The driver sped away without stopping. It was effectively a hit-and-run.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 30th and East Burnside<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-07-06 08:25:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was entering the intersection on a green light, travelling south on NE 30th to cross East Burnside. A car travelling East on Burnside didn't slow down for her red light, until she had almost hit the cyclist ahead of me who was travelling the same way I was and was directly in front of the car. Luckily, the driver slammed on her brakes when she noticed the cyclist and narrowly missed running right into him. I was ~10 feet behind all of this when it happened, watching, as I had only just entered the intersection.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was bicycling west after dark in the bike lane on Capitol Highway. I stopped for the red light at Sunset Ave. When the light turned green I crossed the intersection. A woman in a dark burgundy mini-van was next to me in the left of two travel lanes. She decided, after the intersection, and at the last second, to enter the gas station on my right. She crossed the right travel lane and the bike lane, cutting me off so that I had to brake hard and swerve to not be hit by her. I had a flashing red tail light and a flashing white head light on my bike and was wearing plenty of brightly colored and reflective clothing.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> N. Willamette Blvd @ Westanna<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-17 16:04:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Car drivers drift out of their lane intentionally to cut short the curve in the road and pass into the bike lane as they drive through this curvy bend in Willamette Blvd.  They do this when a biker is in the bike lane and nearly hit them (it's happened to me several times).  Bike lane is narrow and there are storm drains and other pavement problems in the lane here.  Cars go too fast and cannot hold their line so they drive over the bike lane at this spot.  <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Right hook! A driver sitting in traffic on SE 52nd ave heading south decided to take a right hand turn with out signalling as I approached the intersection in the bike lane. The driver should have been completely aware that I was approaching since he passed me along with 3 other cyclists in the bike lane only a few blocks before stopping at the traffic light behind 6 other cars. 
Luckily I was approaching him and the intersection cautiously and was able to stop (while skidding a little) as I saw him make his move with out signaling or checking his mirrors. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Was traveling in the right lane on Natio and passing through the the 99w underpass when a driver in a tan Honda Civic almost sideswiped me at a high speed. She came so close I could have kneed her. I caught up to her at the next light and loudly informed her that cars have to give at least 3ft buffer for bikes. She looked at me completely surprised like she had not seen me at all before. Rather scary to think that had she been paying even less attention she would have nearly killed me. <br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-13 17:05:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> License 540 ARJ, beat up blue Toyota, older white male driver. I had stopped because there was a large moving van stopped at the intersection, and I couldn't see around it to safely proceed. The Toyota driver swerved around me and passes on the right at high speed, shouted at me, then honked his horn at the truck ahead. He put on his left blinker, then turned it off (?) at the Powell intersection. He seemed very agitated and confused.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was driving up Clay street and noticed a bicyclist weaving in and out of traffic behind me in my rear view mirror. The bicyclist then began biking right next to me and hanging out in my blind spot. In an attempt to pull away from the bicyclist whom was between me and cars parked along the road, I sped up. The bicyclist then sped up and flew in front of me and continued to weave in and out of traffic.<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-13 19:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> When I was biking on the Everett St. bicycle road (close to 50th) early yesterday evening, before dusk, someone in a big black SUV turned in, almost hitting me, driving too quickly and not minding whether they turned into me. They definitely saw me with my white jacket and bike lights. There was that momentary hesitation and then they continued turning and barreling ahead, their vehicle taking up most of the road. They saw me but didn't stop. I've decided to start noting the license plates of people who drive recklessly on bicycle roads like this. Their license plate number is YRV651<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Corbett and SW La View Dr<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-14 08:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was headed North on Corbett with 2 kids on a longtail electric cargo bike, travelling downhill at over 18mph (slowing down for the speed humps.)  A driver came speeding up behind me and began to attempt a pass between Logan and Fulton Park Blvd, but gave way to oncoming traffic.  Even without oncoming traffic, there isn't enough visibility here to pass any vehicle travelling at 20mph without exceeding the posted speed of 25 or meeting oncoming traffic at the blind curve or intersection.  As I continued up Corbett toward LaView under electric power at 20mph, the driver again pulled around me, speeding toward the top of a blind crest where a van had just barely completed a left turn from LaView into the oncoming lane.

Had I been driving a car here, I would have been traveling the same speed or even slower to account for the speed humps and choke points between parked cars.  Would this driver have even attempted such a pass in that case?  This aggressive behavior is too common (not just on Corbett) and nearly always fits the definition of Portland's ordinance 16.70.900 Reckless Driving: following too close and/or unsafe passing + speeding.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I started into the intersection East as the car who just started South took off, knowing full well that it would take me some time to gain any ground. I've done this a million times over 30 years, to time the pass just right so that I get past as efficiently as possible. 

That's when the car slams on his breaks, stopping dead in the intersection, I have to swerve quickly, grab onto his truck to not fall in traffic. Neither of us were hurt but I gave a wave and rode off. I'm pretty sure he's still in that intersection, completely deer-in-the-headlamp<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-18 09:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Entering downtown from Terwillinger along 6th avenue I checked my shoulder to merge across traffic to turn left and realized a big green delivery truck was bearing down on me. I backed off, only to have the driver come around me hard and then chop my line, nearly forcing me into the curb. The pass was extremely close, easily less than a foot. There are two main issues here:

1. It's a pinch point with several lanes of traffic, including the bike lane merging together, combined with a high volume of pedestrian traffic. A large truck traveling at a high rate of speed into that area is ripe for disaster.

2. If you are going to pull a move like that, you probably shouldn't do it in a truck wrapped with your company logo and information.

I swung around to communicate to the driver how close he came to me. All he did was wave me off and proceed to make an illegal right hand turn against the light (where it was clearly marked "no turn on red" at the next intersection.)<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Was crossing westbound in the unmarked crosswalk on the south side of Nehalem. I stepped off the curb to signal my intent to cross and a silver, late-model Volvo was approaching NB at a slow rate of speed. The car coming SB stopped to let me cross and I made eye-contact with the Volvo driver as I stepped into the crosswalk.

 I realized that the Volvo driver was not going to stop and jumped out of the way. In doing so my dog's leash slipped and she lurched forward. I reached to grab her and as I did so the Volvo struck me on my left shoulder. The Volvo continued NB without even slowing or pausing to see what had happened or what they had hit.

Fortunately they were moving at a slow speed and neither my dog nor myself was injured, but this driver just didn't seem to care.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> N InterstateAve and N Buffalo St, Portland OR 97217<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-14 13:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> The SUV was on N. Buffalo in the westbound lane stopped at the signal on N Interstate Ave.  I was on the sidewalk.  The signal changed and I entered the crosswalk.  I heard the acceleration of a car engine and looked back.  The SUV was travelling directly toward me in the crosswalk.  I dismounted and walked backward in a panic toward the sidewalk.  The driver saw me and stopped midway into the turn.  I lost my balance and fell over.  I was in pain from my elbow hitting the concrete but otherwise all right.  The driver backed up, onto Buffalo and parked near the intersection.  They helped me up.  It was clear to me that they had been at the light, distracted by something in the car (I had observed them bending over toward the passenger side of the car as I approached the intersection) and didn't look both ways again before accelerating into the turn.  We exchanged phone numbers and I went on my way.  They called me two days later.  But it wasn't until a week had passed that I learned I had broken my arm.  Unfortunately I was not able to communicate this to the driver.  My insurance covered most of my costs.  <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Nebraska and Virginia<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-10-28 17:10:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Headed westbound on SW Nebraska, I stopped at the 4 way stop at SW Virginia. I waited for one southbound driver who arrived at the same time as me to continue southbound, then took a left turn southbound on Virginia. A second southbound driver attempted to run the stop sign, but I was already in the intersection. Because this is a downhill stretch, I can approach 18-20 mph. While I was traveling at this speed, the second southbound driver attempted a pass of me despite oncoming northbound cars on Virginia. I came to a complete stop on Virginia to prevent what would have either been a head-on collision or a sideswiping of me. 

I'm calling this road rage because it's just flat out intimidation for no benefit. <br>

If I had put my arm out, I could have scraped the car. Normally the cars turn very close behind where I am walking, but this was out of the ordinary and very shocking.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Biking southbound on 52nd, signaled left turn, moved left out of bike lane. Driver--presumably distracted--sped up behind me in black sedan, saw me in front of her as I made my turn, laid on her horn and swerved into the bike lane. She appeared to be yelling at me through her closed windows. I was wearing light clothing, a helmet and flashing lights front and rear. 

There was also a pedestrian with a stroller attempting to cross in the marked crosswalk, approaching the curb and signaling his intent to cross as I passed through into my turn.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW Terwilliger and Sam Jackson Park Road<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-09-08 07:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Riding westbound on SW Terwilliger, between Sheridan and where Terwilliger turns south to go up the hill.  This is directly adjacent to  Duniway Park on the south side of the street.  The westbound bike lane is very narrow and the rider is pressed up against the hill on the north side of the road.  Worse, the road curves to the right creating a blind spot for drivers just before cyclists need to merge left across the travel lane to enter a left turn lane.   On this morning (like many other mornings), a driver cut the corner very fast and very tight in front of me, entering the bike lane in the process, and would not have had time to swerve to avoid a cyclist.  I was lucky because he passed me before we entered the blind curve, and not after I had entered it.  This road is one of the few routes for cyclists wanting to leave downtown and head southwest, and is the scariest and most dangerous part of my morning commute.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Knight and SE 15th Ave.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-06-18 07:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Biking east on Knight through one of the dozen unregulated intersections (no stop signs or lights for either direction), vehicle sped through intersection without yielding. I heard them coming and arrived first at the intersection, they didn't appear to hit the brakes at all. I have learned to listen intently for vehicles through these unregulated intersections, many do not stop or acknowledge pedestrians, maybe assuming that the other direction must have a stop sign. Another day in the afternoon I followed a cyclist who did not stop and was not wearing a helmet and watched them almost get hit by a vehicle speeding through the exact same intersection.<br>

She proceeded to drive her car toward me trapping me between her car and a parked vehicle at the curb and hit my handlebar all the while cursing me out in the most profane racist slurs.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling westbound on Clinton when a small red hatchback crossed the intersection at 22nd, northbound, against my right of way. The red hatchback had waited at the stop sign on the south side of Clinton for the car traveling westbound ahead of me to clear the intersection, but then crossed just as I was nearing the intersection, even though I had no stop sign. I was on a borrowed bike with only coaster brakes, so I started yelling and trying to swerve around the car. Somehow I outran it at the front end (just inches to spare) and made it onto the north sidewalk. The red car continued northbound without stopping.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 26th Ave. and SE Gladstone St.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-11-17 08:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding my bicycle westbound on SE Gladstone Street in the bicycle lane.  As I approached the intersection of SE 26th Avenue bus #2203 turned on its right turn signal when it was several vehicles back in line.  As I began to pass the bus in the bicycle lane the bus operator suddenly moved the bus into the bicycle lane and I was forced to brake sufficiently hard to skid to a stop in order to not be forced to the curb.  The bus operator then drove in the bicycle lane until it reached the stop sign and then turned right.  There was no reason for the bus operator to operate in the bicycle lane because it did not stop at the stop at that location.

I had a bright front white light and a red jacket on.  <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling east on SW Pendleton, towards the intersection at SW Hood. Driver traveling south on Hood ran the stop sign. I had to stop. I skidded a little because the road was wet. The driver saw me when he had traveled halfway through and then stopped. I waved him through. I don't need to be biking in front of someone who is blatantly breaking the law.

<b>What happened?:</b> I was heading west on SW Boundary towards the 4 way stop at Corbett. I waited my turn behind 2-3 cars. Cars were approaching from all directions. I approached the stop sign, stopped, and then it was my turn, turned left to go southbound on Corbett. A driver headed southbound on Corbett skipped her turn, and failed to stop at the stop sign. I stopped mid-intersection because I would have been struck by the car.

The driver saw me and then stopped mid intersection. I waved her through because I don't want to be riding my bike in front of such a dangerous driver. She pulled off and parked half a block later on Corbett. <br>

There were cars parked on Reed College Pl leading up to Rex, potentially blocking her view of me. I had the right of way and proceeded into the intersection. As I was entering the intersection, she decided to enter the intersection. I shouted at her. TWICE. The third time I swerved and screamed some choice words one would want to abstain from in front of small children (this was at the elementary school). She stopped her vehicle after my string of profanity. I had to both swerve and scream three times to avoid being hit by here.<br>

This intersection should be reworked to allow traffic to turn during a protected phase only, and not when oncoming traffic is moving. I've had several near-misses at this intersection with this exact same scenario.<br>

I braked but was was unable to stop before striking the passenger side of the vehicle.  I was ejected from my bike and the bike was totaled.

Driver admitted and was found at fault for the crash by insurance.  He stated that he just "didn't see me" because he was driving into the sunrise.  

I have nerve damage in my left hand and received other minor injuries (road rash, bruises).

I requested police to respond to the scene to  file a report.  They arrived at the scene, but (very rudely) informed me they would not take a report because I was not "seriously injured".<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I pressed the crosswalk button at the east side of Meadow Dr. &amp; waiting to cross to the south side of Walker Rd (to the Nike campus side). When I finally got the signal to walk &amp; started to cross, a driver who was westbound on Walker Rd &amp; therefore coming right toward me, was busy eating a burger. When she realized she was blowing the light &amp; screeched to a stop, she was mid-crosswalk (came to a stop with her passenger door right in front of me). If I&#39;d been two feet further along, she&#39;d have run over me.

The 45mph speed on this road is for sure a factor, as is driver distraction. Eating a burger while speeding toward the intersection caused a near-run of a red light and a near-miss. <br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW 1st and SW Jefferson, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-12-08 08:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was on a bike in the right turn lane on southbound SW 1st Ave, waiting for cars ahead to turn right so I could also turn right. A dark blue subaru impreza, Oregon license 456 FUZ, approached from behind squeezed around me on the left (entering the adjacent bike lane and part of the car lane to the left of that) and then turned right onto the far left lane of Jefferson (northbound). From there, the Subaru driver made a rapid right-left-right pass around a vehicle in the left lane of Jefferson, coming close to that vehicle, another person on a bike in the Jefferson bike lane, and another vehicle stopped at the red light at SW 2nd in the right lane. It was raining and the roadway was wet. I make this turn every day for work and this was the most dangerous thing I've seen in a while, as it endangered at least 4 other road users in a one-block distance, not to mention pedestrians had they lost control on the wet surface.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SW North Dakota St and SW 115th Ave, Tigard OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2014-11-12 15:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling northbound upon 115th Ave by bicycle and came to a stop at the intersection of SW North Dakota St. This is a 4-way stop. After waiting for the 2 prior cars to cross, I signaled a left turn and proceeded into the intersection attempting to travel west on North Dakota. 

Prior to my entry into the intersection, I had seen a late model black Dodge Ram pickup approaching the intersection, but it had not reached the stop sign before I entered. I saw the truck continue past the stop sign without slowing or stopping on a direct intersect course towards me, so I took evasive action.

I was unable to avoid a collision, and the pickup driver made no attempt to slow, stop, or change direction, but drove straight towards me and crashed into my bicycle from behind. A witness reported that the driver stopped his vehicle approximately 50' past the intersection, walked part of the way back until he had seen me, then turned around, got back in his truck, and drove away. 

Neither the vehicle nor the suspect driver has been identified nor apprehended. After viewing the video footage from my handlebar mounted camera, the responding officer from the Tigard PD confirmed in his report that the driver failed to obey a traffic control device and failed to render aid (felony hit-and-run).<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 26th and Harrison, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2015-12-10 08:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> At about 8:00 this morning, I was riding my bicycle westbound on Lincoln at 27th, which is a designated greenway with one lane of traffic in each direction and is a school zone too. The driver of a Green Cab in a minivan with the number 172 passed me at high speed, very close, against oncoming traffic, and then took a quick left onto 26th southbound. This was a very dangerous maneuver that threatened my life and almost caused a head on collision with the eastbound car. I'm shaken and upset.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking South on Ladd, approaching the traffic circle at Lavender.

They then brake checked me--twice. I caught up to them at the stoplight at Division. They nearly killed me three times in the space of 15 seconds just to save exactly 0 seconds of travel time.

Subject: NW St Helens Rd bike lane gaps

Dear ODOT:

Would you please address the following two gaps in the west-bound bicycle lane of NW St Helens Rd (aka Hwy 30) in Northwest Portland?  

1.  The maintained asphalt of the WB bike lane narrows to about two feet at the intersection with NW Doane Avenue.  There is no obstruction or other apparent reason why the full width of asphalt is not maintained.  A picture (looking west) is attached.  The narrowing creates a hazard for people using the bicycle lane, including people who must walk there because there is no sidewalk, and also affects access to the TriMet bus stop at this location.  As pictured, heavy truck traffic and high speeds make the situation unsafe here.  

2.  A few hundred yards to the west, at 6589 NW St Helens Rd, gravel accumulates semi-permanently in the bike lane.  See photo attached, and BikePortland article from two years ago which discusses this problem at this location and includes photos of it, as well:
http://bikeportland.org/2014/01/24/lack-of-sweeping-makes-for-challenging-conditions-on-dirty-30-100154
The curve reduces sight distance at this location where people riding bicycles and walking are put into traffic to avoid the gravel and long-term standing water.  In the past I have talked with Region 1 maintenance about this issue.  I was told that ODOT will not consider asphalt “skirts” or bibs at the property entrances or increasing the frequency of sweeps (currently perhaps 3 to 4 times per year) to address the gravel.  I was told ODOT will not address the drainage problem because there may be underground utilities in the area.  Pooling water (see picture attached) which typically remains from October through June.  

The attached Portland Bikeways map shows these two locations.  I have marked them in red.

As you likely know, on Saturday a person was killed at a bike lane gap on Highway 30B (aka NE Lombard St), 11 miles east of these locations.  That tragedy raised discussion about whether ODOT is “aware” of bike lane gaps for purposes of budgeting or planning.  The two gaps I have described appear to be a maintenance problem, not something that should require budgeting or planning.  To the extent any budgeting or planning is needed, however, please communicate this information to the people within ODOT who may need to be aware.

I would be grateful to know what response is planned for these two locations.  If for any reason solving these problems is not going to happen right away please ensure that ODOT and Portland Bureau of Transportation staff who are responsible for updating bikeway maps are aware that the bicycle lane currently mapped at these locations is not usable.  

Thank you,
Scott

Before this point I passed a white sedan, chevy ? which was behind me as I approached the crossover so I assumed it saw me. However, it did not slow down as I was crossing over from left to middle (in the bike lane) almost hitting me. Again another slam on the brakes to avoid a collision.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I had a walk signal allowing me to cross from the south side of Woodstock Blvd. to the north side. As my girlfriend and I were crossing, an enormous black lifted Dodge Ram was approaching from the west and would not slow down, clearly intending to run the red light. Thankfully, the truck lurched to a halt just before it ran me over, encroaching 12 inches into the marked crosswalk. As I continued to cross, the driver rolled down his window and started screaming at us as if *we* were the people who had done something wrong.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding at 20 mph--the speed limit--on a very narrow stretch of Clinton when a car passed with less than 3 ft of space. Since I was going the speed limit, the driver had to illegally exceed the speed limit to pass me. This street has signs literally every four blocks saying "SPEED LIMIT 20 MPH. BICYCLES MAY USE FULL LANE." Apparently this driver didn't think that sign applies to them.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 65th Ave and SE Rhone St.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-01-20 18:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking south on 65th Ave and nearly run over by a driver going the other direction. SE 65th Ave is very narrow, only 27 ft from curb to curb, and there were cars parked in an unbroken line on both sides of the street. When cars are parked on both sides of the street, the usable roadspace is only 11-15 ft wide, making it too narrow for bidirectional traffic at the speed limit. In sections this narrow, speeds of 10-15 mph are much more advisable.

I was almost clear of the section where cars were parked on both sides, but a car coming up from the south refused to wait for me to clear the narrow section and just kept barreling right at me at about 25 mph. There's no way they didn't see me: I run a 1000 lumen headlamp and bike in a bright yellow Endura jacket.<br>

Despite there being no cars parked on the northbound side, the car going north was driving 8 ft away from the northbound curb. 65th is very narrow, only 27 ft from curb to curb, so because the southbound side was an unbroken line of parked cars I had only 3 ft *total* of usable space, with the driver coming at me at 25 mph.

<b>What happened?:</b> A new crosswalk and stop light have been added to the intersection of SE 19th and Tacoma St.  However cars on Tacoma routinely ignore the red light.  I was southbound on 19th and activated the signal at the intersection with Tacoma.  I waited for the walk sign before processing.  An eastbound car drove straight through the red light several seconds after it turned red.  The car did not slow down.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was crossing Woodstock Blvd. from north to south. The eastbound lane was completely clear. There was a car just turning around the corner at 69th ave in the westbound lane when I entered the crosswalk. Instead of stopping, the driver layed on his horn and tried to delay hitting his brakes until the last possible second before running me over. He then flipped me the bird and rolled down his window and started yelling at me. I told him he has to stop at crosswalks. He replied "that's not a crosswalk." I informed him that every intersection in the state, including this one, is a crosswalk. He yelled a bunch more, and then peeled out. This is the second time I've been honked at at this intersection by a driver who had plenty of time to stop for me but couldn't be bothered to.<br>

Maybe he was embarrassed, I don&#39;t know. Obviously he was in a hurry. Didn&#39;t matter much because he had to wait for traffic in order to turn onto westbound Division and then was immediately stuck in traffic at the light on Division &amp; 26th.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> As I was northbound approaching a green light at about 12-15mph, a teal hatchback passed me within 40ft of the crosswalk and turned right onto Barbur directly in front of me.  I was covering my brake levers and so was able to only come within a foot of their rear bumper.  They didn't signal until after they started the turn.  The driver had to have seen me.

I don't often ride through this stretch, but always have problems with this northbound bike lane whether from cars blocking it while leaving the car wash, using it as a right turn lane, or this near right-hook.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Headed north on Barbur in the bike lane at 15-20mph, both northbound auto lanes were stopped solid for the light at Hooker.  A southbound SUV turning across the stopped traffic drove right in front of me and I had to squeeze hard on my brakes to avoid hitting her rear fender.  I was covering my brakes and could see what was going to happen -- suspected she wouldn't pause or check the bike lane and I was even ringing my bell and calling out before reaching the intersection.  It was dark and rainy, but I had two bright headlights.

More space between stopped traffic and the bike lane would have given the driver better visibility   Maybe a green lane.  I don't think she was thinking about the bike lane as a lane of traffic.<br>

Seems safer to ride protected on 2 lane portion going west against east bound traffic. Three almost accidents have occurred to me there in the last 8 months. 

Two times east cars turning right onto east bound Glisan have almost hit me while I wait for a green to proceed. Once on my way home a car tried to turn right into me while I was waiting for green to continue east past 202. <br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-03-08 17:20:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Southbound on Barbur approaching the Capitol Hwy offramp, I activated the loop for the flashing bikes-on-bridge sign and signaled left to merge into the traffic lane.  A driver passed me and then finally turned on her right turn signal and then nearly stopped right in front of me.  I nearly ran into the back of her car because I had already merged into the lane when she stopped.  If she was planning to turn right, why did she speed past me while I was signalling left?  Did she not know the turn was coming?

The bike lane ends right into the bridge.  Trying to ride it past right-turning traffic and then merge is dangerous as there's not any merge space left -- an impatient driver waiting to push past 2-3 right turning cars might not realize they've slowed for a bike and would be accelerating right into the space just as the person on a bike is moving left to take the lane.

The speed limit here is too high to not have a protected bike lane.  Not enforcing the first 10mph over makes it even worse.  PPB needs to step up enforcement here until Portland and ODOT get this fixed.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Belt line road exit off of 35 North bound<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-03-29 17:40:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was trying to get into the left most lane from the exit with heavy oncoming traffic. The unsafe driver was honking from a few cars behind me because I was blocking the only exit waiting for the other cars to pass before I could get into the leftmost lane before the stoplight. The unsafe driver then forced the other cars out of the way and went over the speed limit to pass me barely missing my side mirrors and making other cars come to dangerous halting stops. Her honking never ceased.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> NE 12th Ave and NE Davis<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-03-30 07:53:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Commuting to work this morning. Was waiting to make a left turn at stop sign at SE 12th and Ankeny. Had my left arm out to signal turn. Traffic stopping at red light at SE 12th and Sandy began stacking up to the Ankeny intersection. A woman in a red SUV with OR license plate 373-DBQ (or maybe DQB) blocked the intersection so that I couldn't make my left and the car opposite me couldn't cross 12th. As I swerved around the back of her vehicle and came along the passenger side I looked at her and said "it would have been nice if you had yielded". Didn't yell, wasn't aggressive, used no foul language. Just said it would've been nice. When the light at Sandy changed I resumed Northbound travel in the bike lane. After passing cross-street Davis, this woman deliberately drove her red SUV into the bike lane forcing me to swerve to avoid a collision. That's when I took note of her license plate.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 37th Ave and SE Schiller<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-04-01 08:26:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Driver (blue van, CA plate 7PQE506) stopped where he had no sign but cross traffic did.  I slowed and cautiously passed on the right -- he appeared to be checking his phone (for directions, maybe?).  Once past him the lane gets very narrow due to parked cars, but my pass spurred him to accelerate aggressively and make a dangerous pass in the narrow lane.  He rolled the next stop sign.

Spoke to him at the stop after that (cross traffic prevented him from continuing).  He said he "couldn't wait behind me" and that he was a "perfect driver," insisting he hadn't exceeded the speed limit and had left plenty of space when passing.  I strongly disagree.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was southbound on Vancouver passing through the light at Weidler and a car made a right on red right as I was going through the intersection. This car turned into the far left lane, so a very wide right and I had to straddle the yellow line to avoid being hit, at a fair amount of speed myself as it is downhill. This was right after a Blazers game let out and traffic was heavy, but this driver did not appear to even look at my direction, very close to being a serious injury to myself.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> When I stepped into the crosswalk I was nearly run over by an Uber driver making an illegal right turn from the transit only lane. I was at the lead of about 20 people. There could have been a lot of injuries. I stopped, approached the car, leaned down to make eye contact with the driver, pointed to the sign that says "right two lanes bus and train only," and said "you cannot turn here." The driver mimicked my pointing gesture in a mocking manner. I repeated, "you cannot turn here." The driver continued to mock me, then started waving me to move out of the way. I continued to repeat "you cannot turn here." The driver did not apologize, and then cut off a Max train to get around traffic backed up on Morrison.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was out for a run and reached the cross walk at SE 67th Avenue and SE Woodstock Boulevard. A minivan stopped so that me and another runner on the other side of the street could cross. A woman driving a white mid-size sedan raced up the the intersection and started turning right. I had already started crossing, as it was clear, before she started accelerating into the intersection. She never slowed, let alone stopped, for the stop sign. She blatantly ignored the stop sign and was looking left toward the stopped car while deciding to start her turn. No turn signal was used. I started scrambling backwards to the curb to avoid getting hit (right-hooked). I screamed. She looked my direction, said sorry, and completed her turn. <br>

He did not use a blinker. We were running in the road, and it was still a very close call. If we had been in crossing from the sidewalk, we would have been run over. <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Riding my bike up the hill on Dosch, hand signalled a left turn onto Flower Ter well ahead of actually turning. A blue VW van with OR license 346-EUV completely ignored my hand signal and partially crossed over the center line to pass me. In addition to not being able to make my turn, I had to swerve right to not be hit by the van.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Terwilliger below med school<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-04-26 04:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding in the bike lane on Terwilliger heading towards Hillsdale.  I was below the medical school.  The late afternoon traffic was increasing.  It is a very winding road and as I approached a corner a dove off the bike lane to the center line to cut the corner.  I suddenly cut in front of a car whoa had to brake and then was mad that I had suddenly decided to use the traffic lane even though the bike lane was perfectly adequate.  Maybe I wanted a shorter trip.  Maybe. My poor judgement or my sense of "right" almost got me killed.<br>

<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> The car did nothing wrong, I dove in front of him.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Heading south on barbur lvd<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-04-27 21:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> My buddy and I were traveling south on Barbur Blvd between the two small bridges just passed the hillsdale turnoff.  It was dark and because of that I wore a strobe.  We were having an enjoyable ride, side by side.  I was in the bike lane and my buddy was in the traffic lane.  He did not have a strobe and was wearing dark clothes.  A car came along and I guess did not see or expect him, almost hit him.  I guess the driver was startled to suddenly see a biker in his path.  He honked at us, not very friendly.  I think that the driver almost killed my buddy by not seeing us riding alongside each other, in the dark, wearing dark clothing but hey, we have a right to be on the road and not use the bike path should we choose.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking uphill with parked cars on either side of the road.  I heard a vehicle approaching from behind, but continued to maintain my lane.  He then came close enough to me to bump my rear tire, and laid on the horn, even though there was literally nowhere for me to go.  I stopped to look at him, and he squeezed next to me, by hitting me with the passenger side mirror, and started yelling obscenities and pointing at me.  He then revvved his a bunch of times and peeled away.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding west on SE Harrison just before 7 AM.

Fortunately, he had the sun roof open so he could hear me when I screamed and he stopped.  I would not have had time to stop and thought I would have hit him and would have ended up airborne.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding southbound on SE 52nd Ave in the primary lane behind two cars. I had my arm fully extended to indicate my intention to turn left onto Woodward. A driver was waiting at the east stop sign on Woodward for the two cars ahead of me to pass. When I got to Woodward and started turning, the driver turned onto 52nd on a collision course with me. I'm pretty sure we would have collided if I didn't have a car horn to honk at him. His window was down, so I could see that he was looking south--in the opposite direction from the way I was coming. I clearly had right of way, was occupying the primary lane, and was running a 1000 lumen headlamp and wearing a bright yellow cycling jersey. There's no way he didn't see me coming behind the two cars.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking southbound on 52nd Ave occupying the primary vehicle lane. I had my left arm fully extended to indicate my intention to turn left onto Woodward. Because of northbound traffic on 52nd, I had to stop and wait for the intersection to clear before making my turn. A westbound driver on Woodward blew through the stop sign and squeezed between me and the curb extension to make a right turn onto 52nd, avoiding sideswiping me by inches.

I got to the intersection first; I was wearing a bright yellow cycling jersey and running a 1000 lumen headlight and bright red taillight. The driver ignored a stop sign and basic traffic safety when they could have just waited literally half a second for northbound traffic to clear.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Geary at Laguna San Francisco, CA<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-02-19 18:45:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Driver was making a left turn from Laguna (northbound) onto Geary (westbound), and I saw her on her phone as I was crossing the street from the north side of Geary to the south side of Geary. There were a number of other pedestrians and the driver drove very close to us as she made her left turn onto Geary, which is how I could see very clearly that she appeared to be talking on her phone.

The first four number/letters of the license plate were 7DJZ or some other combination thereof, it's quite possible I got the letters mixed up. She sped off on Geary (after making her left turn) so quickly that I didn't have enough much time to try to catch the last three digits. The car was a burgundy-ish color, and the driver appeared to be in her 20s (possibly early 30s).<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE 57th and Powell, Portland OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-05-27 08:00:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was waiting to cross Powell at the marked crosswalk here, on my bike with my 2-year-old son in the bike seat behind me. A TriMet bus stopped for me in the right lane. I almost always wait to cross until I can see both lanes have stopped, but it appeared no vehicles were coming in the left lane as far as I could see. I started moving across Powell and was almost into the left lane when a car suddenly came around the bus at a high rate of speed. He stopped and I stopped in time to avoid contact. I spoke to him through his open window and he said he couldn't see me because of the bus. I told him to slow down and pay closer attention. My son, behind me, had no idea how close we had come. 

I don't 100% blame the car driver. It is hard to see past a bus and I'm not sure whether he whipped around it or was in the left lane the whole time. I am pretty sure he was speeding, however, and I also blame a crosswalk with difficult visibility. Next time I probably will just wave a bus or other large vehicle past if I can't see the left lane.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> This happens on the ramp coming from Mutnomah leading to Terwilliger. This happens all the time. Cars drive in the bike lane trying to get around the left turn lane traffic backp. I have almost been hit here 10 times. There needs to be a line of cones separating the bike lane from the cars. This is a very bad situation, as the bikes further up the ramp are blocked from veiw from the speeding cars in the bike lane because of the curve in the road.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was pedaling south-east on State Route 112 and approaching the intersection with Industrial Loop Road, preparing to turn left onto 1000 North Street. I had moved into the left turn lane and the opposing traffic was at least an half mile away. I notice a few cars approach on the side street to my left which are stop sign controlled, mostly them turning right so they would be no conflict. I kicked it in to clear the intersection as quick as possible when a car blew the stop sign on my left and was headed directly at me. Fortunately, I had enough speed to clear out of the way, had I been a second slower, they would have been scraping me off the road.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was traveling east on Rhone; it was dark and I had my headlight on high (700+ lumens), lane position just left of the door zone.  A northbound SUV on SE 28th Ave ran the stop at Rhone and turned left (west) toward me, cutting the corner sharply so that the vehicle was entirely in my lane and accelerating.  The driver appeared to be involved in a conversation with her passenger.

I screamed loudly, and she swerved to her right as I dodged to mine.  We missed each other, but not by as much as I'd like.  She appeared shaken.  I goddamn well hope she was.<br>

I had to yell louder and louder and louder until I was screaming at the top of my lungs to get him to stop. Instead of apologizing, he started screaming at me even though I had the right-of-way 100%.<br>

As I was turning left at the gas station, it was especially important to merge left at this time. I put my left arm out to signal the merge, waited until the cars nearest me passed, and then moved left. A red older BMW sedan with Oregon license plate YNN-266 that was quite far back but was exceeding the speed limit -accelerated!- to try to intimidate me and make me wait for him to pass before letting me merge. I merged anyway and as the BMW came along side me (having been delayed by less than a second at this point), the driver opened his window and yelled at me something about f-ing up his travel time when there was "nothing but empty space behind him". (Apparently he thought I was able to see through his car). I said back pretty calmly that he should slow down, he was exceeding the speed limit, and it wasn't a race. He yelled back f*#k you. My tail light video camera caught the whole encounter including his reckless driving, speeding, intimidation, attempted failure to yield right of way along with his license plate, the date and time, and the audio of his belligerent attitude.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Harrison and SE 20th<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-08-16 13:16:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding east on SE Harrison.  I stopped at the 4-way stop sign at SE 20th.  I proceeded into the intersection (there were no cars close to the intersection when I did this).  A driver in a BMW SUV or crossover approached on SE 20th, heading north (and on my right).  He was going pretty fast but I thought he would stop.  As I crossed the southbound lane of SE 20th and began to enter the cut in the barrier that is intended to stop motor vehicles from going east or west on Harrison, I had to yell at the driver to stop.  He stopped just as I was about to cross in front of him.  He did not stop until he was more than a car length past the stop sign.
I have ridden, walked, and driven through this intersection thousands of times.  I have seen so many violations - from blatant running of the stop sign like today, to drivers who think it's ok to "piggyback" on the car that stopped ahead of them, to motorists who drive over the barrier.  My fellow cyclists are just as guilty of blowing through the stop signs as motorists. Too often I see cyclists heading west on SE Harrison traveling at 20 MPH plus who blow through that stop sign even when there are cars already stopped on SE 20th.  The Portland police need to do a sting here before someone is maimed or killed. In the 26 years I've been traveling through this intersection, this is at least the third time that I could have been seriously injured, or worse, while riding my bike.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking North in the bike lane on 12th, approaching the stoplight where  12th ends and it becomes 16th if you go right and Lloyd if you go left. As I'm biking forward straight in the bike lane, a car crosses into the bike lane in order to get to the right turn lane.

<b>Where were you?:</b> 540 SE Hawthorne Blvd, Portland, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2016-03-15 18:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> East bound on Hawthorne Blvd, just past Grand, in bike lane going ~15mph, with 150 lm tail light, 400 lm head light, and reflective gear.  About 1/4th of the way through the block, a MAX bus started to pass me.  After the cab passed me I saw the front end of the bus pull hard to the right and slowing rapidly to pull into the bus station, while most of the bus was still behind me.  I immediately had to break hard and skid to the right all the way to the curb to avoid the side of the bus hitting me.  If I had hesitated for even one second I would not have been able to get out of the way.  I am very accustomed to riding on bus routes, so I know how to avoid conflicts with buses, but this bus driver was way out of line with this right hook.  My date and time are approximate, sorry.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Driver going south on 51st completely ignored stop sign. I was cycling west on Clinton. He was driving around 8mph, so I had time to screech to a stop (while screaming), but I believe he nicked the front of my tire.

I made eye contact with the driver, but at no point did I believe he even attempted to brake -- either before or after near-collision. He pulled a large trailer obscuring his license plate; otherwise, I would've called police on him.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was heading West on my bicycle.
Red Ford Mustang 6 or 8 cylinder with Oregon plates slow rolled through the stop then sped up.  I braked; pointed to the stop sign and announced 'That's a stop sign you're running and you need to stop back there'.
She then flicked me off; rolled down her window and starting yelling that she was going to run me over with her fucking car.  
I waved back
She then proceeded to do burnouts in the intersection to turn her car Westward on Going to catch up to me to 'run me down'.  She then drove next to me for 1/3 of a block; stating that I do not have the right of way and what a 'piece of shit' I was.  She then attempted to right hook me and turned down 19th or 20th speeding through the neighborhood the whole way.

I have filed a police report.<br>

Both cars did not see me, one turned in front of me as I neared the intersection and then the other car began to go while I was in front of it. This is not the first time I have almost been hit near this area. Drivers seem confused or not to notice stop signs and the lack thereof.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding my bike south on SE 6th and stopped behind a large box truck at Madison, and then a pickup truck pulled up close to me on my left, so I decided to get off my bike and walk across Madison, to get away from the trucks. I stood with my bike at the NW corner of the intersection and waited until the west-bound cars had all stopped for me, then I proceeded to walk across Madison. However, there was a man driving a sedan trying to turn left onto Madison from 6th on the opposite side of the intersection, and he apparently didn't see me crossing, because he started turning as I crossed and nearly ran his car into me (I would guess that he was looking east, saw the cars stop, and thought they were stopping so he could make his turn, and didn't look west because it's a one-way street). Luckily, he stopped just in time.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I had right-of-way in bike lane along Colby. Older driver pulled up to stop sign and looked the other way to see if another car was coming. I watched her carefully! She did NOT take a second look in my direction. Therefore I came to a near stop, suspecting she did not see me. SHE DID NOT, and pulled out right in front of me. NEAR MISS!

Note: Over-darkening of drivers' windows in cars  has now become a very serious threat to bikes and pedestrians. And, It,s illegal, BUT popular! <br>

<b>What happened?:</b> Heading south on 12th Street in the PM peak hour, there is a long queue of cars and very few bikes.  The right turn lane for southbound traffic crosses the bike lane (with the bike lane ending up between the right and thru lanes).  The driver was stopped and the traffic started to free-up in front of the driver right at the point that I was passing through in the bike lane.  The driver entered the bike lane forcing me to the curb.  I could have been riding more defensively but it would have been ideal for the drive to also be aware of his surroundings, as I was on an uphill slope.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Oregon 10 and SW Terwilliger Blvd.<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2017-06-19 06:57:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Just below Terwilliger intersection I was heading East on Beaverton Hillsdale Highway. As per road markings (sharrow), I took the lane and was travelling at speed limit. White BMW SUV with Oregon blue/yellow license plate # 9U-3767 that was behind me crossed completely over double yellow line and into oncoming travel lane to pass me. As I was already doing the speed limit, the driver had very little time and space to complete his illegal pass and had to swerve back over too close in front of me as oncoming traffic appeared. I captured a clear picture of his license plate, time stamp, and video of his illegal maneuver with my camera taillight.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Passing without sufficient space, Excessive speed, Crossing double yellow to pass.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was headed north on NE 20th Ave between Stanton and Siskiyou Street when a silver Lexus, Oregon Plate 509-GTN, passed dangerously close. The vehicle's side mirror grazed my jacket. I was taking the lane to avoid debris on the side of the road. At the time, I believed that because I was occupying the lane the vehicle would not attempt a pass. The driver was a white male.

<b>What happened?:</b> Driver with a lyft sticker rolled through the stop sign on Chestnut at Bertha as I was preparing to turn left from Bertha onto Chestnut.  Two cars were headed north on Bertha and I was arriving at Chestnut just after they had cleared the intersection (but with those cars obscuring the driver's view of me in the left-turn lane.)  Driver arrived at the stop sign just as the cars were clearing the intersection.  He rolled out in front of me, turning left across my path.  I was barely able to avoid colliding with his rear wheel.  It was dark and rainy, but his windows were rolled up and he didn't stop at the stop sign (probably cutting-through a neighborhood when he could have gone via major streets with a signal.)<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was in the green cyclist box waiting for light to change so I could continue south on 7th Ave. A white Acura crossover SUV with Oregon license plate 100JWV came up hot behind me and proceeded to occupy the green box, intending to make an illegal right on red. He was very close to me and had very little room to get between me and the curb. I yelled at him to stop and he rolled down his window. I said "you're in the green cyclist box". He said "I see that" and proceeded to complete his illegal maneuver at a high rate of speed, probably to get away from me before I could read his license plate. Luckily, my taillight high-def camera caught the whole thing on video including the license plate and a time/date stamp.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> SE Harrison and SE 20th<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2018-03-23 15:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding west on SE Harrison.  At the 4-way stop, I stopped and then entered the intersection, as I was the first user to reach the intersection.  A driver on my right, driving south on SE 20th, came to a stop after I entered the intersection and did not look in my direction at all.  I was hit by this driver. 
This is a major problem with this intersection - drivers do not think that any road users will be going straight (west or east on SE Harrison) because of the the low divider at this intersection.  As someone who has ridden through this intersection hundreds of times, I know that this has been a dangerous intersection.  I hope that the Harrison-Lincoln bikeway improvements will eliminate this infrastructure issue.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Failing to stop for a stop sign, Perhaps it is better to say that this driver failed to yield after stopping to another road user who had already entered the intersection<br>

<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2018-06-22 16:26:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Traveling east on SE Holgate, on the shoulder so cars could pass me. Slowed as I started passing line of cars waiting at stop light at SE 82nd. Dark-colored sedan, about 7-8 cars back from light, suddenly opened passenger side door into my path. Passenger decided they wanted to get out there and didn't check if it was clear prior to opening door, even though they had just passed me no more than 15 seconds before. There was just enough gap between door and curb to avoid collision.<br>
<b>Do you believe the driver committed a traffic violation?:</b> The driver broke a traffic law<br>
<b>What best describes the situation?:</b> Lack of safe infrastructure, Inattentive driver, Improper opening of vehicle door<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> Gresham Fairview Trail and NW Division, Gresham, OR<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2018-04-23 17:30:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> Traveling north on the Gresham Fairview Trail, stopped at Division Street (south side). Had activated flashing crossing beacon but was waiting to make sure traffic in all lanes appeared to be stopping before proceeding. There were 3-4 cars in each westbound lane that were stopped, and as I began to move into the road a westbound car coming down the hill at excessive speed didn't brake and moved into the median to get around waiting vehicles. He then had to swerve suddenly to avoid traffic island in median, which he hit with his rear passenger side wheel, causing the back end of his car to skid slightly my direction. I noticed him early so stopped moving further, so he missed me by 8-10 feet, but then had to swerve back across the median quickly to avoid cars waiting in the eastbound lanes. He didn't slow at all and even accelerated afterwards to at least 20mph over the speed limit.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was biking north on SW 14th Ave at a relatively busy time (there was pretty significant traffic in the intersection) and the driver was driving west on Washington, taking a right turn onto 14th. He didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign and drove directly across the bike lane. I was able to somehow get off my bike a few inches before it crashed into his driver-side door. I dented his car and chipped his paint. Besides bruised up, I think me &amp; my bike are fine. We didn&#39;t exchange any information. No car or people around stopped to make sure we were okay or to admit they saw the accident.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> This is an offset intersection with two way stop signs for NE 55th. I was EB on Everett and proceeding through the intersection when a NB car on NE 55th rolled the stop sign and did not yield. I had to brake hard to avoid a crash as the driver wasn't going to. Many similar near misses at this intersection. I've seen someone on the ground in the morning after being hit by a car and have written the city. City response is it was fine and won't change. Will probably take a serious injury or death to get the city to do anything here as drivers will continue to break the law and not look.<br>

<b>Where were you?:</b> 5th Ave N and Roy St, Seattle, WA<br>
<b>When did this occur?:</b> 2019-06-14 16:15:00<br>
<b>What happened?:</b> The incident occurred on Friday, June 14th at approximately 4:15pm while I was commuting from my home to my workplace. The location of the incident was the intersection of 5th Ave N and Roy St in Seattle, WA. Visibility at the time of the incident was clear. I was traveling south on 5th Ave N where there are clear shared lane markings for bicycles, and after the intersection with Roy St, a dedicated bicycle lane. I travel this route safely multiple times every weekday to commute from my home to my office. I was in full control at the time of the incident and wearing a full-face helmet. I approached the intersection while the light was already green for my direction with the intention to travel straight across towards Mercer St. Floro was traveling north on 5th Ave N and intended to make a left turn from 5th Ave N onto Roy St, across my path of travel. The left turn onto Roy St. from 5th Ave N is arrow-controlled, has a clearly-marked sign saying "LEFT TURN YIELD ON GREEN" and flashes a yellow caution arrow while the opposite direction is green.

I had already entered the intersection on a green light and was traveling straight across when Floro entered the intersection. Floro failed to yield as instructed by the multiple markings, and accelerated to turn sharply left onto Roy St, directly into my path of travel. As soon as I saw Floro's vehicle accelerating directly towards me, I engaged the brakes as hard as possible and put my arms up in an attempt to protect my body. Floro continued to accelerate directly into me and struck my full body with the front right of his vehicle. I lost consciousness for several seconds after being struck by Floro's vehicle and was flung backwards onto the pavement. After I regained consciousness, a female bystander who had witnessed the accident ran up to me in the middle of the intersection, asked me if I was okay and mentioned that Floro was staring at her on the corner of the intersection while he accelerated into me. Floro continued to drive onto Roy St. After several moments, I was able to stand up, gather some of my belongings and limp out of the intersection in pain to find Floro on Roy St where I called 911 and we exchanged information.<br>

<b>What happened?:</b> I was riding my bicycle east on NE Jonesmore. A car came up behind me. It sounded like they were quite close so I turned to look. At that moment they swerved into me and tapped my back wheel. I lost control and crashed into a chain link fence at the curb. I yelled at the car to stop but they kept driving. It seemed to me to be deliberate. 

I called Portland Police who came to the scene. I filed a report but there wasn't much that could be done as there were no witnesses and I wasn't able to read their license plate. 

I had minor injuries (sprained finger, scrapes and cuts). I did not seek medical care. 

It was an older maroon sedan, possibly a Toyota Corolla. <br>
