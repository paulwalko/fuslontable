<b>Stolen Items:</b> None - Chase Unsuccessful<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> The chaser boat was a 60/70 foot boat in poor condition, with no fishing equipment, We crossed the "pirate ship" course, now less than 200 meters from our stern, remaining ahead. Crew of the pirate boat was in the bow, around the quarterdeck and  I saw the hooks on deck, ready to be launched. At that point our speed indicator log begun to score 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 knots. (catamarans can be fast).The pirate ship started to become smaller and smaller. The gloomy figures on the quarterdeck less distinguishable. After just a few minutes the pirates decided to "give up", changing route again. We decided to stay on a full speed course until we had put at least 10 miles of water between us and them.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Money, Camera, Ipod Mp3, Gasoline, VHF, GPS, various random items they could find<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Whilst underway close to Punta Sal we noticed a small fishing boat following us from the west. They approached and asked for gasoline. Suddenly 3 of the 4 men  boarded our sailing vessel with guns and demanded money.  We were threatened with guns to our heads and a knife to my wife's throat. We cooperated with the pirates and gave them what they wanted. The pirates cut the main halyard, cut the gps cables, stole the VHF radio and other electronics, threw our fresh water supplies over board and put the engine in full throttle. They grounded the sailboat into the secluded  bay "Escondido" inside the Jeanette Kava National Park. 4 days later we were rescued after SOS signs we made in the ground at the park's entrance were seen by visitors who arrived by boat to another area of the park. No one was harmed, but it was a frightening experience. The boat was damaged and was still aground several days after we were rescued while local officials worked with the captain to make temporary repairs and remove the yacht to a repair facility.  CSSN NOTE: When local and federal Honduran officials learned of this incident, they  provided not only assistance to the captain, but also  hotel accommodations, support and return air travel to the temporary crew/victims.<br>

<b>Country Name:</b> Nicaragua<br>
<b>Location Detail:</b> Media Luna Cays<br>
<b>COUNTRY:</b> 15.2333333<br>
<b>COUNTRY 2:</b> -82.6<br>
<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> all extra diesel stored in containers, mobile phones, money, clothes, food, fishing equipement, navigation aids, personal effects, various sailing equipement<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht owner and friend were sailing a 12m monohull from Bocas del Toro, Panama to Belize. Passing 30-40 miles off the shallow coast of Nicaragua, it had been a difficult and tiring trip so they decided to make a rest stop in the uninhabited Media Luna Cays.  At 10 AM while underway they were approached at high speed by 2 pangas (longboats with outboards), each with 4 men onboard. They seemed friendly initially and asked for a drink, and were given a few beers. 

Then suddenly many more boats appeared over the horizon, making thirteen in all, and the intentions of the assembled group became clear. They overwhelmed the yacht, and were raucous and menacing while their visible knives remain sheathed. They attempted to “guide” the boat onto the reef where 2 other wrecked boats were visible. When the yacht veered away they became more aggressive and began to ram into the side of the yacht, causing damage to the hull and port lights. The crew managed to keep sailing as they were boarded by 25-30 men, with another 30 or so men in the remaining pangas.  A larger boat with a cabin and radio antenna carried the leader. He boarded and demanded to search the boat for cocaine. The crew negotiated a truce of sorts with the leader and allowed him (only) to search below. Some of the others forced their way below anyway, and along with the many pirates topsides helped themselves to fuel, food, cash, cellphones, fishing gear, clothing, marine electronics and anything they could remove. The crew protested when they took gear necessary to their continued travel and in a few cases it was reluctantly returned by the leader. The leader seemed proud of his control over his assistants and eventually forced them up and off the yacht. He asked for a reward for keeping his word, and pointed to a small Wi-Fi speaker, which he was given. The pirate leader and crew thanked each other and shook hands. The pirates then departed and the crew continued onto Belize, where they made a report to the Cucumber Beach Marina on arrival. They were relieved the pirates had remained nonviolent, after not finding the cocaine that they had apparently expected to commandeer.  A courtesy report to the regional British High Commission (consulate) has been made.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A large motor yacht was on passage between Colon, Panama and Roatan, Honduras off the coast of Nicaragua north of Isla Providencia (Colombia) when a 60 foot steel fishing boat attempted to ram and board them. At full speed (14 knots) the motor yacht was able to successfully outrun the pirates. A report was made to the US Coast Guard.

CSSN UPDATE!
CSSN UPDATE!
First hand report just in from the victims: “Pirates tried to ram and board us off the coast of Nicaragua.  They gave chase and at full speed we were able to outrun them.  A warning to all cruisers needs to be initiated.  We were in transit from Colon, Panama to Roatan, Honduras.  We were taking the outside route north of la Providencia .” The vessel was a  60 foot steel vessel- white and blue.  Very good condition. Boat name - Mister Henson.  Fishing Vessel with crab fence.  No other fishing equipment. Minimum of 6 men aboard.
Time 11 am Wednesday morning, January 27. Location :
N14*30'13.0
W 081*55'41.9
The Captain was communicating with other boat/partner name Reynaldo.  They switched to SSB and we're discussing money.”

Additional CSSN sources advised:  A "Quick [internet] search [revealed the existence of a] Mister Henson IMO # 9064607 trawler built 1992 by Rodriguez Boat Builders Bayou La Batre Alabama. The tonnage is way high to be the boat at 120 ton. But it is flagged Honduras and a search of the builder shows expedition trawlers of 70 feet. If the 120 ton is a typo this is the boat."<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 2<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> None<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> In the absence of a firsthand report CSSN has compiled information from multiple credible second hand sources, who spoke directly with the involved captain in Trinidad. A 65 ft. sailing yacht with 3 persons on-board on passage to Trinidad encountered what were felt to be probable “pirates” during daylight hours. The yacht’s position was 2-5 miles east of the Hibiscus platform, and its sails would likely have been visible for 10-12 miles.   A pirogue with 5-6 Spanish speaking men made multiple rapid approaches to the yacht, and began yelling (about fuel). One of the men in the pirogue appeared to have a holstered gun at his waist.  The yacht captain began multiple evasive maneuvers and had crew “pose” as though they themselves were armed while visibly appearing to make VHF radio contact with TT Coast Guard, North Post radio and the Hibiscus platform itself.  The emergency VHF radio calls were not answered.  After about 15 minutes the pirogue gave up chase and departed to the west. The yacht continued onto Trinidad.  No float plan had been filed with TTCG; it is unclear if any official reports have been made.  CSSN will update this report if additional information becomes available.<br>

<b>Country Name:</b> Trinidad/Tobago<br>
<b>Location Detail:</b> Grenada-Trinidad passage<br>
<b>COUNTRY:</b> 10.89615419<br>
<b>COUNTRY 2:</b> -61.61682129<br>
<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> None<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Three yachts left Grenada in the afternoon, bound for Trinidad. A float plan was filed with TTCG/NPR and Jesse James. The reporting captain attempted to call North Post Radio and Trinidad Coastguard on two separate occasions on VHF 16 during the voyage but did not get a response to either call. The first call was to NPR at approximately 1600, from a position about 5 miles south of the Grenada coast. The second call was to TTCG between midnight and 0100, about 3 miles directly east of the Hibiscus platform. The captain is confident his radio was working properly, he made contact with the other yachts (VHF 71) and also with the marina on arrival (VHF 16 and 72). During the passage he was able to listen to North Post Radio and heard them monitoring and conversing with other vessels.

After passing 3 miles east of the platform the yacht continued due south. The next morning (August 2) at approx. 0630, his yacht was motor sailing at about 3 knots and located 10 nm northeast of Boca Monos.   The 2 other yachts, Buddy Boat 1 (BB1) and Buddy Boat 2 (BB2), were about 1 nm further east (BB1) and 2 nm further south (BB2). The yacht was approached by a white pirogue with 3 men onboard. The men in the pirogue spoke English and there were no fishing nets or any fishing gear in the pirogue. The yacht captain went to his starboard rail with his handheld VHF and in full view of the pirogue called the nearest buddy boat (BB1) to tell them what was happening. He describes the situation: 

• The general attitude of the two men who spoke was aggressive and angry. With much shouting and waving of arms in the general direction of Trinidad – it seemed to me that they were telling me to slow down and not go any further ….the noise level was high since this was happening as they approached with their engine and our engine noise making communication indistinct and hard to make out initially. There was no doubt in my mind that this was not a friendly encounter.
• The pirogue pulled up alongside on our starboard side, and tried to get as close to my boat as was feasible. Two men were standing and one tried to hold on to the hull of my boat but the sea state was too rough and they pulled away about 1 meter.
• One of the men shouted across to us in an aggressive manner - asking what “sea area are we in?” – I replied that we were off the coast of Trinidad
• He then shouted across, pointing ahead…“what is that Island..?” – I replied Trinidad
• The second man then shouted across “what is that …” while gesticulating at the passage ahead …I took it to mean that they were trying to point out the Boca – I replied Boca Monos
• I updated BB1 on the situation, using my handheld VHF. This seemed to increase the agitation of the men in the pirogue. 
• BB1 immediately turned directly towards us. 
• Our VHF communication would have been audible to the men in the pirogue. They were obviously annoyed that I was speaking to someone. They were not asking directions, the conversation was heated; aggressive; menacing. There was absolutely no doubt that the “directions” were a ruse, we were being sized up.
• The men had a conversation amongst themselves and pulled away at high speed. They went eastwards in the general direction of BB1. 
• They did not make any further approach to any of our vessels.
• We updated BB1 and BB2 and all 3 vessels continued towards Boca Monos.
• We did not attempt further calls to the coast guard at that time.

All three yachts arrived safely in Chaguaramas later that morning. The captain contacted Jesse James, who arranged and attended a meeting the next day with the TTCG Fleet Commander, where an official report was made. Based on details described by the reporting captain, TTCG indicated that the pirogue was likely from Trinidad. Follow up with Jesse James indicates that TTCG/NPR has assured him that they will continue to patrol the area and try to improve their communications.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Guests onboard a chartered catamaran on an SMMA mooring in Soufriere, St. Lucia, were awakened at 0130 am when they were boarded by 4 men. 2 of the men were armed with guns, and 1 with a knife, all had their faces concealed. 

Three of the men damaged a deck hatch to break into the locked yacht while the fourth cut the davit lines on the dinghy during this violent boarding. There were 6 members in the charter group, 2 families each with a teenage daughter. The women and children quickly locked themselves inside a cabin. There were many threats and a short struggle. One victim was hit in the face with a gun, the other hit on the head. The boarders demanded cash, cellphones and passports. The cash and cellphones were surrendered readily and the passports and access to the locked cabin refused. After 20 terrifying minutes of further threats of violence and death the 4 men left with the dinghy. 

Reports were made to the charter base and police. The police took NO forensic evidence and told the victims and the charter company that they did “not want any media involved as it might scare tourists”. The charter company has assisted the victims with communications and arranged for a local media outlet to film an interview, which has not been broadcast. The dinghy was abandoned ashore and later recovered. 

The police have since asked for some details about the stolen cellphones by email, but have not informed the victims of any arrests in this matter. The victims describe this as a “violent, aggressive and prolonged attack that left their families traumatized” and point out that at no point during the charter briefing were they informed of any “no go” or problem areas. They were advised to use the cable and lock provided to secure the dinghy when ashore.  

CSSN NOTE: As a matter of policy CSSN will publish updates if police confirm to the victims that there has been significant progress in this matter.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Computers, smartphone, cash, electronics, binocular , vhf and handheld radios, alcohol, clothing<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A French flagged catamaran departed Isla Providencia (Colombia) for Rio Dulce, Guatemala on 1/18/2017 at 8 AM. Travelling well offshore the Nicaraguan coastline, they turned OFF their AIS transmitter but monitored all traffic closely. They noticed only a few cargo or fishing vessels.
At 0830 on the morning of the 19th, after traveling 175 nm, now located 70 nm off the Nicaraguan coast and 35 nm ESE of the Hobbies islands they were approached by a single panga from the north with 6-7 men who asked for water and food. They were provided. At 0900 the same panga returned asking for more, and a pack of cigarettes was given, while suddenly 2 more fishing boats with 40 HP outboards approached at high speed from the south with 6-7 additional men. They converged on the catamaran, rammed and boarded the yacht, now visibly armed with knives and iron bars. Some of the pirates beat the locked doors and gained entry to the cabin while the others scavenged on deck. The leaders seemed to be looking for drugs, but found none. The pirates took computers, a smartphone, cash, assorted electronics, binoculars, VHF and handheld radios, alcohol, clothing, anything that they could grab or remove. After about an hour they departed.
Using a previously hidden VHF the crew made contact with a nearby merchant cargo ship which then contacted the Colombian navy and piracy agency while diverting in their direction.  At 1030 AM a single panga returned with a mixed group of 8 of the youngest of the original pirates and again boarded, holding knives to the throats of the crew, this time attempting to sever the locked to the yacht dinghy/outboard. They were not successful and became nervous when they heard a VHF transmission from the approaching cargo vessel. The second group of pirates departed. The crew again made radio contact with the cargo vessel who took all necessary information and agreed to inform Colombian officials, the yacht declined further assistance and both vessels returned to their intended courses. The yacht proceeded to Guanaja, Honduras without further incident. They arrived on Friday January 20, and began the process of filing official reports with the police, port captain, Honduran navy and piracy agencies. Much had been stolen, there was damage to the yacht, but no injuries.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> iPads, electronics, rum<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Preliminary Report : Chris Parker has provided the following information from a Weather Center subscribing yacht currently transiting from west Panama to the Yucatan. The yacht was boarded late on the 19th off Gordo Bank by pirates who seemed to be looking for drugs. Finding none, they took iPads, small electronics and rum. No injuries. No further infomation is currently available but a detailed report is expected once the yacht reaches its destination.
CSSN UPDATE 2017-01-26:  Victims have provided a detailed FIRST HAND REPORT:
A 40 ft. monohull sailing from Panama passed over Gorda Banks at night with their AIS turned off. Passing Gorda Cay, they saw several fair sized fishing boats at the cay. A couple of hours later as they were exiting the banks about 10 miles NW of Gorda Cay, a panga tried to approach but was not able to overtake them, they were sailing quite fast. 
The too-slow panga left but the men returned in a larger panga. Seeming friendly, they were fairly young and asked for food. They wouldn't leave the yacht alone, came close and were thrown a pineapple. They seemed happy and went away. A while later, another panga with several young men caught up with the yacht and asked for liquor. They were persistent but friendly and were tossed a six pack of beer. They also went away seeming happy. Then a third panga with a few men came asking for liquor. They were told they didn't have any and were tossed a melon. They went away. 
Meanwhile the crew had texted friends using their Delorme InReach satellite texting system, alerting them that they were being pursued and didn't know if these were just desperate fishermen or pirates. At about 12 noon 4 pangas with a total of about 30 men approached and the crew activated the DSC distress signals on the SSB and VHF. Their InReach contact alerted the US Coast Guard in Baltimore, MD, to the changing situation.
The pirates signaled for everyone to put their hands up as they boarded.  The lead panga carrying a man they all called “Boss" came alongside, bumping against the hull, and demanded in Spanish that they stop the engine. Faced with overwhelming force, they turned more into the wind and slowed down but pleaded ignorance as to their understanding of Spanish.
Several men boarded the boat. One had a knife that he continuously tapped on top of the chartplotter at the helm. One of the other men spoke some English and told the crew he wanted his men to go below and "inspect" the boat. He was told that only 2 at a time could go down, but several went down anyway. They turned off the SSB and VHF distress signals and ransacked the boat. They opened every cupboard and floorboard presumably looking for drugs. The English speaking pirate reported to "Boss" and when they found no drugs, the pirates down below took whatever they wanted, the most valuable of which included an iPad, a GPS, foul weather gear and shoes. Oddly, they did not ask for money. The “Boss” told them to finish up and the English speaking pirate made the crew shake hands as if this were a normal business transaction. The pirates motored away, and the crew continued sailing onward. 
The crew was grateful that they were not harmed. Official reports to authorities will be made after the yacht reaches the US mainland.<br>

At 0330 the dinghy, minus its 30HP outboard was found adrift off the outside beach. Tire tracks and drag marks indicated the outboard was stolen with the assistance of a vehicle. No one was on the beach at this point, including members of the Commandante’s squad who claim to patrol there from 6PM to 6AM. The next day a report was made to the police, the Commandante’s office, and on the local VHF net.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> At approximately 8 PM cruisers returned to the dinghy dock on the old pier in Esperanza, and discovered their dinghy/outboard had been stolen. The dinghy was chained to the dock with 3/8” stainless steel chain and locked with a case-hardened lock, the outboard engine was similarly chained and locked to the dinghy. 

The dinghy minus the outboard was found just off the beach to the east of the dock with both chains and one of the locks cut with a bolt cutter. A police report was made and victims were informed by the local police that this was the 4th motor theft this week. 

The owners indicate the police took little interest in assessing the situation - writing down little, looking at the dinghy or the area where it was left and they took no photos. The owners believe that well prepared theives with large bolt cutters are actively operating in the area and advise extra precautions.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A motor yacht stored on the hard for hurricane season was burgled. The yacht was securely locked and a key provided to Boatyard/Marina office. The owners returned in December 2016 and found no signs of forced entry, but were surprised to find a payroll slip for a Jolly Harbor marina employee inside the boat. The employee had no approval or reason to be inside the locked boat. Marina/yard management was advised of the pay slip but offered no comment or explanation.

 A few weeks later the owners discovered that tools had been taken from various storage compartments inside the yacht. When they examined the yacht’s safe they discovered its hinge had been pried off from the rear and then carefully replaced, and the extensive camera equipment stored there was all missing as well.
 
CSSN NOTE: This is the third theft suffered by a stored yacht at this yard this season. Keys supplied to the office seem not to be kept under control, and were used to enter and remove property from the stored yachts/lockers, and then returned to the office.  If you leave your yacht and provide a key to anyone, be certain to understand how and where that key is kept secure, and how access/use is controlled, and in the case of multiple access, is signature logged.  Any unusual findings on return to the yacht should prompt immediate consultation with the yard management, and a thorough search of key areas/contents made at that time.
 
It’s easy to review the prior incidents, simply type “Jolly Harbor” in the search box on any CSSN website page.<br>

From behind the catamaran’s locked cockpit doors they observed a male boarder who stood in the cockpit, then sat and stared back at the astonished and concerned crew. A few minutes later he left. 

Later that morning a man was found asleep on an unoccupied boat on the adjacent dock, and when awakened and questioned he indicated he was waiting for the owner (who was not present) and then he departed. After a report was made to the Marina, a review of their video surveillance was made but the man’s face was obscured and not conclusive, but he appeared similar to the boarder, and the photos/description have been provided to the police and the marina guard.  The crew felt both the police and marina were responsive and the police advised calling the local emergency number in cases of future boardings.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 185ft 1/2inch Anchor Chain<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Overnight 185 ft. of ½ inch anchor chain was stolen. It had been stored in a metal barrel with a closed lid under a yacht located next to the restaurant at Clarkes Court Bay Boatyard. The owners discovered the theft the next day, the barrel had not been moved and the lid had been put back in place. Boatyard security/management was informed immediately, and admitted this was not the first theft of a significant amount of chain from the yard. The boatyard was well searched but no chain was found and owners “put out the word” that all they wanted was the chain back. The next day during a driving rain the owners were told by a boatyard subcontractor that a pile of chain was at the end of the yard, in an area that had been thoroughly searched the prior evening. It was their chain, lying on the same blue bag that had previously contained it, inside the now empty barrel. No police report was filed.

CSSN NOTE: While this may seem a satisfactory ending for these owners, others who visit this yard, or any other yard or marina, should ask about any incidents and make certain management has put effective processes in place to prevent theft from the premises. Asking these questions BEFORE you patronize a facility will allow you to make informed decisions, and serves as a reminder of the importance of good security to those responsible for providing it.  Those who have put robust processes in place, and then monitor their effectiveness, will be proud to tell you about them. Then make your own inspection. Examples of effective controls include well secured perimeters, gate control with logged access landside, 24HR monitoring of waterside access, robust video surveillance, inspection of exiting vehicles/backpacks, a posted policy of “zero tolerance” and prosecution of offenders.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> Owners of a yacht berthed on the outside dock at Marina Zar Par awakened to a masked intruder at their bedside. He spoke only Spanish (which they understood) smelled of alcohol and was dripping wet. He had gained entry thru the unlocked companionway.

 A brief struggle ensued, he demanded cash and jewelry, which was freely given. The intruder tied both crew up holding a knife to the woman’s neck. He held his hand roughly against her mouth to silence her causing minor injuries, which were later treated by a doctor.  After he departed, the crew managed to untie themselves and reported to the Zar Par Marina Security office. 

The security team provided immediate assistance by calling the police, who arrived promptly, and in gaining medical treatment for the woman.  A formal report was also made to the Coast Guard the next day, and the police are investigating.

CSSN UPDATE: September 15, 2017. A first hand report has been received from one of the victims. The captain and crew of an occupied catamaran at anchor in Prickly Bay were awakened at 04:30 when a thief who had boarded lowered and disconnected the raised dinghy/outboard from its davits, it was not locked to the yacht. After much yelling other boats in the anchorage became aware of the situation and the thief attempted to escape in the stolen dinghy. He drifted away but could not get it to start. He removed and discarded the fuel line before paddling it back to the yacht to retrieve his yellow kayak to make another escape attempt. A scuffle ensued but the thief escaped in the kayak which had remained tied behind the yacht. The dinghy was recovered, minus the fuel line. A report was made the next day to police/coast guard. The coast guard were in possession of (and trying to locate the true owners) another dinghy and also a compressor, found tied behind another (unoccupied) yacht the same night. Later, other yachts were found to have evidence of attempted break-ins.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 55ft sailing yacht- monohull<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> In late April 2017 between the daylight hours of 1400 and 1715, a 55 ft. monohull sailing yacht moored in Clifton Harbor was stolen. The owner and crew were nearby but did not witness the actual theft. They notified SVG authorities (marine park, police and coast guard) and the owner began a localized search by boat which carried on into the darkness, but without result.
 
Early the next morning the SVG police insisted on further reports and after 3-4 hours of doing such the owner hired a pilot and personally conducted an aerial search. The boat was located at Diamond Island, a small rock islet between Grenada and Carriacou. An open boat was seen rapidly leaving the scene to the south. Grenada Coast Guard was notified but took no immediate action.  The pilot returned the owner to Union and he travelled by local boat to Carriacou where he contracted with another local boat to inspect and retrieve the yacht which had been damaged, arriving at the foundering yacht by early afternoon.
 
The thieves had damaged a hatch breaking into the yacht and stole many things including an outboard, dive gear, life jackets, fuel jugs, fenders, handheld VHF, etc.  The yacht sustained significant damage to its rudder and hull having been left to ground.  After emergency repairs and pumping the water out, the owner took the yacht to Carriacou under escort and after additional inspections and temporary repairs to Grenada for haulout and repairs , which have recently been completed. 

Neither the SVG officials (where the yacht was stolen) nor the Grenada officials (where the yacht was found) took any evidence from the scene and after many months, and many requests, no SVG police report has been made available to the victim.<br>

Video surveillance from shore revealed that at 1:10 AM the thief unscrewed the light bulb on the dock, and then in darkness was able to use a box knife to cut the lifting strap, (damaging it) and releasing the panga. The 40HP outboard was visibly well secured to the panga, and would have required serious tools/effort to remove. The lifted panga was not secured to the dock. A report was made to the police and port captain.

The pirates did NOT display any weapons, but simply overran the yacht. The captain did not resist in any way. The pirates ransacked the yacht for about an hour. They ""took everything"", cash,  phone, GPS, computer, dive gear, fishing gear, food, medicine, rum and many small items. The captain was able to negotiate with the leaders and was allowed to keep a navigational computer and a small GPS, as well as some jerry jugs of diesel. The pirates asked for drugs (there were none) before finally departing.

There were no injuries. The captain describes that damage to the yacht was out of ignorance, not malice.  A report was made to Colombian officials in Providencia on arrival.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> After 2 nights moored in Marigot’s inner bay on a Capella mooring, on the third day the crew went ashore for dinner. Between 4-7pm both fishing rods were stolen from the rod holders on either side of the cockpit. There was no evidence that the thief boarded the yacht. The marina office and police were advised. The victims and CSSN suggest removing all unsecured items of value from the deck/cockpit, and having a record of serial numbers/photos stored in a secure way/place (that cannot be stolen from the yacht) for purposes of investigation and proof of ownership should a theft occur. CSSN NOTE: This is the 2nd theft reported to CSSN within the last month at this location, and the 5th this year. Users can type “Marigot St Lucia” in the search box on any CSSN website page to get a quick summary/links, or utilize the islands reports tab (Northern Windwards) and sort on the location column for easily reviewed details.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> At 11:45 PM a yacht (B2) that was moored stern to in the Bridgetown Careenage inner lagoon was vandalized. A young man had engaged the crew on the adjacent boat (B1) and had been provided with some food. The young man then became abusive and, at some point, hauled the stern lines and jumped on to the transom (B2) where he held on to and seriously bent the stainless steel bimini frame. The crew was roused by the commotion, came on deck and ejected the boarder. The neighboring boat (B1) dialed 911 and the police arrived 10 or 15 minutes later. They apprehended the young man some way off and led him away. The officer informed the crews that the young man was unknown to him (unlike the other vagrants in the area), that he seemed to be mentally unstable and would be dealt with accordingly. He advised the crews not to engage with or support the local vagrants.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A dinghy/outboard hoisted on the port side was stolen overnight from an occupied yacht.  It was not locked to the yacht. The theft was reported to the police, the boatyard and later on the VHF net, two other dinghies were also stolen the same night. Details for those thefts are not currently available.  CSSN NOTES: Securely locking (visibly) a hoisted dinghy can make the difference. Additionally, using cable (vs. rope) for the harness to a height sufficient to make it out of “machete reach” can further reduce the chance of theft. Making timely first hand reports helps other cruisers, it’s easy with the CSSN online reporting form!  https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/?p=665<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht stored on the hard at Jolly Harbor Marina for the off-season was burglarized. The padlocked cockpit lazarette was opened, and the generator removed, and the lock replaced but not closed.  The boat minder noticed the opened lock during a visit and simply closed it without noticing the generator had been removed. The owner noticed a foot from the generator in the cockpit on his return,  and when he retrieved and used the only key (from the marina office) he discovered the theft.  Reported to the marina and the police.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Three yachts moored on private moorings in Chemin Bay were similarly vandalised overnight. All were unoccupied but locked. All 3 boats were ransacked. Lockers were opened and the contents strewn about the cabin sole. Power tools, hand tools, cell phones and radios were left behind, only a flare gun was taken from one of the affected yachts. The police and Coast Guard were notified. The police believe the thief stole a local dinghy to gain access, it was found abandoned in the nearby mangroves. The police indicated that they have a suspect who is known to have done this type of thing previously. CSSN NOTE: These 3 incidents are very similar to 3 that occured in this same bay in late 2014, the thief seemingly had a "shopping list" on those occasions as well.

When we returned to the dinghy to leave, we discovered the locking cable was completely severed. Another dinghy (see previous report) had cut marks on their cable. Reported to the CG, police, the nearby restaurant and on the VHF net. The next morning the dinghy was found by other cruisers beached in a cove about 1/4 mile south of the dock without further damage and with its outboard. A candy wrapper found inside the recovered dinghy was the same type that had been taken from a locked yacht that was burglarized in a nearby bay the same night. (see next report)<br>

The owners were not aware of the theft at the time it occurred but became aware of the theft when a local woman who found some of the non-cash items returned them a few days later.

<b>Stolen Items:</b> <br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> At about 1700 a male cruiser left his wife aboard and took his dog by dinghy for a walk on the east end of Hog Island. After a short while he was met by 3 english speaking men and was greeted in a friendly manner, he continued the walk. After about 20 minutes he began his return to the dinghy and encountered a family of 5, who played with the dog for a few minutes. Continuing the walk, and almost back to the dinghy he encountered the same 3 men, who invited him to join them. When the cruiser did so, one of the men, the Primary Perpetrator, (PP) produced a small handgun, pointed it at him, and demanded that the cruiser dinghy them out to the yacht, stating that the cruiser, the family of 5, and the dog would all be killed if the cruiser refused, and that the 3 would then go to the vessel (where the cruiser’s wife had remained). 

At approximately 1800, the cruiser transported 2 of the perpetrators, (PP) and a 2nd Perpetrator, (2P) to the anchored yacht, where the PP demanded that the cruising couple haul anchor and provide transport to Puerto Rico. The yacht’s engine had not functioned for several weeks, but PP demanded that the couple sail out of the bay and then to Puerto Rico. It was clear neither perpetrator had skills as a mariner. The couple complied, but the yacht became grounded while leaving the bay and was unable to proceed. The PP assaulted both the husband and wife as well as his accomplice, while showing signs of instability, sometimes mumbling and shouting incoherently at no one. 

At approximately 1930 the PP forced the wife and his accomplice into the dinghy, indicating that he would hold the wife hostage until the husband freed the yacht and they were able to proceed to Puerto Rico. The dinghy was then taken to the mainland of Grenada, landing in the area of Fort Jeudy (approx. 1.5 miles away). PP forced the wife and his accomplice to proceed to an unoccupied home with him. Over the next several hours, PP continued to assault both the wife and his accomplice (2P). 

At approximately 2330, PP forced the wife and 2P to return to the dinghy, and attempted to return to the yacht.  On approach, the presence of other vessels engaged in assisting the husband with the stranded yacht discouraged PP from re-boarding and hijacking the yacht. They returned to shore, PP and 2P eventually departed, and the wife was able to return by dinghy to the yacht at about 0100, July 31. 

Those assisting the yacht were then informed of the circumstances and authorities were summoned, and the Grenada Coast Guard arrived promptly to provide assistance. They remained with the yacht overnight, while the couple received medical treatment, which is ongoing. The yacht has been refloated, but was damaged. The primary perpetrator (PP) has been identified and is being sought by the local police. 

CSSN NOTE: This report is classified as second hand, we would like to thank the close friends of the victims who provided the report on their behalf.
CSSN UPDATE : August 5, 2016 - CSSN has confirmed that Grenada police have taken 2 men into custody, those thought to be the Primary Perpetrator (PP) , and the Second Perpetrator (2P). It is not known when formal charges will be made. 
CSSN UPDATE: August 11, 2016 – Local News source MTV NEWS Grenada reports that multiple charges have been filed jointly against the two men believed to be the Primary Perpetrator (PP) Toobooi Timothy Williams, and the Second Perpetrator (2P) Irvin Thomas. The two are charged with multiple offenses carried out across the island. Court dates have been set in 3 courts for later in August. Details of the MTV report are available here:

<b>DETAILS:</b> While at anchor near Isla Grande, a man in a cayuco attempted to steal the dinghy, but he was noisy, awakened the crew and they were able to scare him away. The dinghy was secured and the couple slept in the cockpit.  About an hour later 2 swimmers were able to board the boat, and attacked with knives. During the altercation the crew received bruises and many cuts, but were eventually able to repel the attackers. The crew immediately upped anchor and moved offshore.  They made an emergency radio call. The Colombian Coast Guard arrived about an hour later, and met them offshore.  After completing a report to the Coast Guard the crew departed for Cartagena.

The dinghy was on davits and locked to the yacht, but now had an empty canoe tied to its bow. The boat and surrounding area were searched with lights, no one was found, and nothing was missing. The following morning the Navy stopped by to retrieve the canoe and inform the cruiser that they had picked up a soaking wet man onshore the previous night. Apparently the thief was looking for an outboard/dinghy to steal and he was interrupted, and jumped into the water and swam to shore rather than risk a confrontation. A report was made to the Port Captain.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> In the water but locked Walker Bay dinghy with 9.9 Suzuki 4S outboard was stolen overnight from an occupied yacht in Cienfuegos, Cuba. Reported to the local authorities. CSSN UPDATE : A First Hand report has been received and provides the following additional information: “During the night our dinghy, a 10ft Walker Bay Ultra Light with Suzuki 9.9 4 stroke outboard was stolen. Dinghy was in the water but locked to the stern with a 1/4 inch steel cable. At approximately 7:00am we discovered the dinghy missing. The cable had been cut clean through. Local police and the marina were informed immediately. The police wanted a sample of the cable but could not cut it with their wire cutters so we gave them what was left. The investigation is ongoing but today they informed us the dinghy has likely been scrapped and the outboard stripped for parts already. This happened 100 meters off the marina docks. The authorities have been very supportive and have been keeping us updated twice a day on the status of the investigation.”<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A British flagged vessel was boarded by 2 armed men (knife and gun), 3rd man remained in pirogue. Injuries were reported, and were treated by a physician on a nearby boat. This report was taken during the daily KPK service net. CSSN will update this report when more information is provided by the victims. CSSN UPDATE: First hand report received from the victims as follows:
At 2300 on 25th May 2016, a British flagged yacht was boarded by two masked men, one with a gun, the other a knife. At the time, the couple were asleep in bed but were woken by the noise of a speedboat’s engine and, shortly after, by the noise of forced entry via the companionway, which was closed and bolted on the interior and damaged as a result of the intrusion. The intruders demanded money and one of them hit the Captain several times on the head with the ship’s heavy torch, whilst his wife was held with an arm around her neck and a gun (possibly imitation) was pointed to her head. The intruders took about EC$500 from the Captain’s wallet but refused to believe that was all the cash on board. The Captain was losing much blood from the head wounds but they still demanded more money. They also wanted cell phones and VHF radios so that the crew ‘could not contact anyone’. The Captain’s wife gave them three old cell phones that were not used on board, and they took a handheld radio from its cradle. This was later retrieved from the intruders, along with the heavy torch, during a scuffle as they left the yacht in a hurry after about 12 minutes on board. A third man, waiting in a speed boat alongside the yacht, then sped them away. The Captain suffered several head and face injuries, two fractured ribs and some bruising, and was attended by a doctor in the anchorage immediately after the event. His wife was unhurt. The SVG Coastguard, who were contacted by a neighboring yacht, arrived quickly. Three suspects are currently charged with multiple offenses and are in police custody in Kingstown SV. 

The Captain recommends that all cruisers, even in such beautiful places as the Tobago Cays, take security on board very seriously. The best security is to make it so hard for intruders to get into the yacht quickly that they give up, maybe hastened by floodlights/alarm activated by a panic button inside the yacht.<br>

The security guard was knocked down. The robbers demanded money at gunpoint. They were given wallets and a camera. One woman's purse was cut off her shoulder with the machete. Her husband was struck on the head with the blunt side of the machete. When the group came into the dock originally, they declined the dinghy watching "service" of some teenagers. The teens were quite unhappy about it and threatened to return with a machete. The cruisers departed St. Lucia immediately. The Still Resort staff has kept the victims advised after making a report to the Royal St. Lucia Police, who are investigating. The camera and wallets (containing only ID)have been recovered.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht at anchor had raised and locked their dinghy on stern davits for the night. The yacht itself was fully closed and locked as well. At approximately 2130 hours the captain was awakened by noise against the deck/hull and went to investigate. He discovered three men with scarves covering their heads and faces, rummaging in the hoisted dinghy. The men immediately rowed away in their hard local dinghy. The captain made calls on VHF 16/68 to the SVG Coast Guard, but had no response. They informed the one other yacht in the bay and re-anchored closer to the hotel. The next day it was discovered that canvas covers on forward hatches had been slashed and two pairs of flip flops had been taken from the dinghy. The yacht departed for Bequia the next morning, and made a police report there. CSSN NOTE: While the report to local officials was made in a timely way, this report has just been received by CSSN and is included now for completeness of the records.<br>

On the first of January 2016 likely the same individual(s) returned, broke into the boat moored up against a private dock and stole the regulator. It is a Silent Wind generator. The boat is on a private dock in the corner of the lagoon, down near Pizza Pizza. These were very precise crimes.  More bizarre was the cutting of the fender tie lines and removal of 3 fenders. They chose a time I was away from the boat over the festive season. Damage was minimal and nothing else was taken or disturbed but the boat was virtually empty, everything not screwed down had already been removed for internal re-varnishing. Anyone with info about this wind generator should contact PC Edwards at Gros Islet CID at +1 758 456 3830<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> electronics, cash<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> On January 14, 2016 a French single-hander, en route from the Bahamas to Guadeloupe stopped to rest overnight in a protected anchorage on the southwest coast of St. Croix. The next morning, 30 minutes after departing the anchorage at 1100 HRS, while under power, and then located about 1.5 miles offshore, he was approached and boarded in an act of piracy by 2 of 3 young men onboard a big fishing boat. The men aggressively threatened him, shouting “drugs, money” and punched him in the face and then stabbed/slashed his lower left leg. They took cash and electronics from below. The captain was then shot in the right thigh at close range, severely wounding him, and left on the floor of his drifting boat when the men departed. The captain, although bleeding profusely and in severe pain was able to maneuver his boat back into the industrial harbor alongside a tug. He tossed shells, winch handles, etc. at the side of the tug. It took about 45 minutes before he was able to get the attention of anyone on the much larger tug. A tug crewmember eventually investigated the unusual noises and then summoned the police and ambulance. The victim was transported to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for his serious injuries, some 3 hours after the initial attack. The boat was put in the care of the police, and later hauled for storage. After a period of hospitalization, the victim was stabilized and then returned to France, where he remains hospitalized after additional surgeries. CSSN NOTE: CSSN wishes to thank the Good Samaritan who assisted the victim with communications and translated a first person report from French.  CSSN suggests that anyone who finds themselves in a serious situation while outside their home country, particularly if not able to speak the local language, make or request contact with the closest of their home country Consular Services/Embassy. Consular officials can assist with a variety of helpful emergency resources, including qualified translators, communications with family/friends as well as with all of the appropriate local officials. CSSN will post further updates here as they become available.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Robbery<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Small waterproof bag containing a camera and personal items.<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> We were returning to our boat after an evening out.  I had just stepped onto the dinghy dock when a man suddenly appeared right behind
me and grabbed my small waterproof shoulder bag.  It was around my
neck so he used a machete and cut the strap.  He ran away down the
beach and into the woods. No injuries, but reported to Police, Coast Guard, local VHF Net, and Bequia Tourism Office.

CSSN UPDATE :

The stolen bag was recovered on the south end of the beach by a resident.  The camera and reading
glasses were gone.  Dinghy lights, boat cards and a pen remained in the bag.

We asked the Bequia police about getting a copy of the police
report.  To do this we must make an application and then take the ferry to
St Vincent, find our way to some specific police station and pay $100 EC to
get a copy of the official police report that we made. We later confirmed this burdensome "victim unfriendly" process several times with not only the police but others in the community.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Boarding and robbery between Trinidad and Grenada of a 32 foot sailing sloop three on board. The vessel had passed close west of Trinidad Hibiscus Gas Platform and was some 30 miles from Trinidad with 40 to go to Grenada.

At about 10am, when  about 30 nautical miles from Trinidad,  to the north and a little to the west of the Hibiscus Gas Platform, the sloop was approached from the eastern side by a pirogue.  It was  an unmarked pirogue which looked white (or slightly bluish) on the outside with a grey gunnel with a 130 hp outboard on the stern and a 150 hp outboard laying inside. The pirogue had three blue barrels in it, presumably containing extra fuel. Six persons were on board. They all spoke Spanish and one spoke broken English.

Three boarded while the others kept gun barrels under cloth wraps pointed at crew. The people in the pirogue  used what appeared to be a rifle but the captain could not say for sure as it was hidden by a piece of cloth.They took everything they could get: clothes, computer, cell phones, trinidad flag, clock, etc.  TOTAL Value about $4,000us
They did not harm the occupants or harm the vessel but the pirates threatened to kill the captain if he called for help. The pirates were aboard for about 20 minutes. They remained cool and were not nervous or jumpy.

After the robbery the pirogue headed off in a s.w. Direction, towards venezuela.

Reported to the TT coastguard and YSATT.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> On December 19 at approximately noon, a 75ft sailing yacht was sailing from Chaguaramas Trinidad N.  In the vicinity of the Hibiscus Gas platform or 40 to 50 mile N of Trinidad,  the boat was approached by a white with blue trim fishing type boat with 5 young men aboard.  The fishing boat had 3 or 4 barrels that the crew guessed was extra fuel. They came up from astern speaking Spanish apparently asking for something.  Once close to the yacht, one individual pulled out a military type assault rifle and made it clear they were coming aboard. the crew was held at gunpoint the entire time. 2 guys stayed in the boat, 2 went through the boat. 1 with the gun stayed with the 3 Yacht crew in the cockpit.  No shots fired.  Yacht  crew wondered if they even had ammo. They were aboard for approximately 15 minutes and took money and electronics. None of the 3 crew were injured. The yacht carried on to Grenada and reported the incident to the Trinidad and US Coast Guards. CSSN NOTE: After some clarification CSSN learned the original report to CSSN was made on behalf of the Captain and Crew by a source in direct contact with them.Therefore, we must classify this as a second hand report. CSSN may receive a few more details forn the victims once they sort out lost passports and communication devices, etc..CSSN  will update this post as new information is available.

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 13ft Boston Whaler taken from mooring and outboard stolen<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> At 2.25am a team of determined thieves stole our Boston Whaler from Nettle Bay, French St. Martin. They had to cut through stainless steel chains and locks securing the boat to two sand screws. We know the whaler was towed out into Marigot Bay to a position approx 18.05N 63.09W, where we surmise the thieves then cut the two stainless steel chains and three heavy stainless steel locks securing the 15hp Yamaha outboard and probably loaded it onto a ship or boat. They then towed the whaler back into Simpson Bay and at approx 3.30am tied it to the stern of a rusted-out fire boat to the north of the Witches Tit. Why they towed the boat back into the Lagoon is a mystery. While reporting this to the Brigade Nautique, someone else was reporting the theft of their 10ft aluminium hulled RIB and 20HP engine. The owner said his dinghy was locked to his yacht with two stainless steel cables, both of which were cut. The incident happened at the same time as our whaler was stolen and in the same area of Marigot Bay where our whaler had it's outboard removed before being towed back into the Lagoon. I know the positions and times because the whaler is fitted with a tracker. We lost a whaler in similar circumstances just over a year ago, I use the whaler for my business,  hence the tracker. Unfortunately, there was no tracker on the engine. We though we had done enough to secure the boat. We were wrong. Those who took it were tooled up, not chance thieves or kids. CSSN NOTE: When possible lifting and locking your dinghy to the yacht with stainless steel chain and a quality lock is your best protection against theft.  SXM remains a particularly problematic area, and thefts are under reported. Please keep the cruising community informed, our online incident reporting form makes it easy.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Assault<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Robbers grabbed everything they could see of value including all  jewellery, tanzanite, pearls, 2 diamond rings, including a Cullinan diamond. Also stolen were outboard motors (both gone), watches, phones,  computers, cash, credit cards, fishing rods etc. 
Fortunately they did not take passports &amp; boat papers, nor did they rip out main navigation equipment (other than hand held vhfs &amp; binoculars) nor ropes.<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> We were boarded by armed PROFESSIONAL THIEVES  &amp; robbed in Taganga Bay, near Santa Marta, Colombia. The incident took place at around 2.30am and reads almost identical to this one, reported on noonsite in 2012, down to them being high on drugs:
There were 5 men, who arrived in a dugout canoe. 4 boarded, at least 2 had guns &amp; 1 had a knife, that we saw. We were both tied up &amp; hit by 4 thieves, at least 2 of the 4 on board had guns &amp; one had a small knife at my husbands throat. The dogs did not bark.
We did have a plan of action if this kind of thing happened, unfortunately, my husband heard something hit the side of the boat &amp; woke up. Instead of turning on the cockpit lights, he unlocked the door &amp; went out to look. We had agreed that we would turn lights on &amp; make noise. If we were locked inside the boat, at least we would have time to make radio &amp; phone calls, but he was sleepy, not thinking straight &amp; went straight out to 4 guys with guns &amp; knives. I had actually hidden away our tablet, which has a good navigation program &amp; they missed taking the dongle from the computer which had a local sim with airtime, so I was able to get a call out to our agent Dino who raised the alarm with police &amp; coastguard.I could not get anyone on channel 16 or channel 72 for 1/2 hour and it was at least an hour before the coastguard came.
We had spoken with other people who advised us to go into the marina. We made  an informed decision with an unfortunate outcome. Always read noonsite, Caribbean safety &amp; security network,  Facebook cruising group reports prior to going anywhere.
Our incident was almost identical to the one reported on noonsite in 2012. I wonder if it was the same &#39;gang&#39;? The police didn&#39;t even come on board to check the 100 &#39; s of fingerprints, so the follow up comments from that report that the authorities are taking such incidents seriously is suspect! We really hope that local stakeholders in this area can provide an organised safe haven for cruisers, perhaps something similar to PAYS in Dominica.. We truly hope this never happens again in this bay.
Reported to Police, Coast Guard and Marina.<br>

CSSN NOTE: this is the 7th incident (reported to us) at this location this year.<br>

<b>COUNTRY 2:</b> -68.858952<br>
<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted theft<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> nothing, dinghy painter was cut nearly thru<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> On awakening the crew of a boat anchored in Spanish Waters discovered that overnight their dinghy had been tampered with. The canvas cover for the outboard had been removed, and the painter nearly cut thru with a sharp implement of some sort. The dinghy was cabled and locked to the yacht, the outboard engine was securely locked to the dinghy. The owners asked CSSN to specifically remind and warn others that this pattern of attempted/actual theft has occurred here in Spanish Waters before, the swimout thieves drift off in the night with the dinghy to work away at the locks on the outboard in a remote area, and the dinghy minus the outboard is sometimes later recovered, sometimes the entire dinghy is swum ashore and then taken away by a waiting pickup truck.. This incident was reported on the local Curacao daily VHF net, but it can happen to anyone, anywhere. CSSN NOTE: cables, stainless steel chains and sturdy locks do provide a first order of defense against casual "sneak" thieves, but LIFTING and then also LOCKING provides a more robust deterrent.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> While the Manamo River/Orinoco Basin are not in the strictest sense part of the Caribbean, cruisers from Trinidad/Tobago have often chosen to explore this remote area.  CSSN has received a first hand report from a single hander who was boarded, restrained and held at gunpoint while his boat was ransacked on the night of 24 May 2015. Six men boarded from a (stolen) engine-less boat, ransacked the yacht and stole valuable silver coins and other items. The captain did not resist, he was tied up, his head covered with a shirt, but left unharmed. He later reported the incident to the Guardia, who showed little interest and did not follow up.

<b>DETAILS:</b> At 1 am May 8th, 2015, while stern-to at the Marina Bas du Fort in Guadeloupe, a man boarded our boat and came into our cockpit. Both my husband and myself were woken by the footsteps and confronted the man in the cockpit from behind a locked main cabin door. The man quickly jumped off the boat and ran down the dock letting himself out through the security gate. We called the 24/7 marina number. The person at that number did not speak English. When the marina office opened we contacted them and they were very helpful in relaying our information to the marina management, it is uncertain if marina management contacted the police. It was later learned that other boats had been boarded the same night.  As a precaution the owners now adjust their med moor lines at night to move their locked  boat further off the dock . CSSN NOTE: This is the 3rd incident of this type at this marina in 2015.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> The dinghy was raised and because of 2 previous boardings on the same island I also remove the dinghy bung and safety dongle so that starting of the dinghy would be difficult.  I had left a floatation jacket over the lifeline for drying - totally forgot about this item.  The clothes pegs are always left out because who would want to steal them?? My flip flops were left in the raised dinghy as they always are and will be.  Someone came on board during the night and stole the jacket, bag of clothes pegs and flip flops without making any noticeable noise as they have done before on one of the 2 occasions in the past. First sign of boarding was that the lock saloon door was at a slight angle. No police report was made. CSSN NOTE: 2 prior incidents dated 12-30-2012 and 4-25-2015 have been added to the database.<br>

The yacht left the mooring . Reports were made to the police and Coast Guard. CSSN UPDATE: 2015-04-14 :  Our original posting failed to include that the Coast Guard responded very quickly, within about 10 minutes, to this threatening situation.  We later learned that the yacht subsequently returned to the mooring, and that business interests in the area conducted a meeting with local boatmen to convey the seriousness of this type of behavior and to (hopefully) prevent any future occurrences.<br>

The men were agressive, with much yelling and arm waving, but the crew cooperated. They forced the boat to go 2 miles back to Corial at first light after taking all the cash on board ($1000), laptops and some other gear from the captain . The official then "allowed" the boat to depart to go onward to Pestel, Haiti the next planned stop. It is unlikely a police report was made.

<b>DETAILS:</b> Soufriere on St Lucia, next to the Pitons. We were on a mooring ball next to the bat caves near the town. Boat boys were plentiful, offering services to cruisers. We have always thought them to be helpful...and harmless. We woke to find footprints all over our main salon. Luckily, we had left nothing in plain sight, so nothing was stolen, but we had clearly been boarded. Our neighbors on the next mooring ball were not as lucky. The owner had left his wallet on the main salon table and $300 was stolen from it. The moral of the story is that we should have locked ourselves into the boat when we went to bed.....something we have never felt we needed to do before.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A single man paddled a small boat out and climbed up our steering vane structure and proceeded forward on deck in the darkness.  His movements woke me, and I came on deck to investigate.  My oldest daughter was sleeping in the cockpit at the time, my wife and youngest daughter were below.  He said "I'm just a fisherman trying to retrieve my line", but of course he had no fishing gear.  He rapidly climbed back into his boat and paddled off.  We attempted calls on VHF 16, but no response.  The next morning we notified nearby boats and reported it to the police, who had just returned from investigating a burglary on shore by our mooring.  We found the boat he had used and subsequently scuttled, but it had been stolen earlier.  I was not able to provide a very helpful description to the police. In  retrospect, the most valuable action we could have taken would have been pictures.  There was ample opportunity to photograph him, and that more than anything else would have aided the local police.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 15 HP Yamaha Enduro Outboard Engine<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Wile crew was off island, Yacht stored in yard for antifouling 27 November 2014. Returned to Rodney Bay Marina Yard a about 8.20pm on 3rd Feb 2015.  No guard at the main yard gate. Pedestrian gate was wide open. Once onboard it was clear the outboard was missing, and  the dinghy was hanging differently.  The motor was affixed to the dinghy with a strong stainless steel padlock through the aluminum engine mounting tighteners. Additionally, a steel antitheft cable was looped through the motor lifting handle and affixed to yacht with an additional padlock.  The tightener padlock was missing. A piece of sheared aluminum tightener was in the dinghy.  Padlock on the steel cable was mangled, but not defeated, so cable was cut. This theft would have taken time and been noisy. After searching, we found a guard with a dog, who asked us if the engine in the guard hut was ours.  It was not (A Tohatsu).  The guard said that they had interrupted a burglary and that engine had been left under a boat.  Judging by green algea growing in the water which colleced as a result of motor being removed, the theft had taken place some time ago, Date of incident is approximate.

<b>DETAILS:</b> After 600 € had already been stolen from the boat on the evening before while crew was ashore, the crew tried to lock as many hatches and doors as possible. Only two hatches on the deck of two cabins had been left open, but secured with some ropes. At 3.00 am in the morning, foodsteps were heard on the deck and some of the crew woke up and started to check the boat. One saw a man just stepping down from the catamaran into a little wooden boat with rows and started to shout loudly at him. Soon the whole crew was awoke and two crewmembers went after the man and stopped him. Man said he was just a fisherman and jumped off the boat to flee in the jungle at the shore. Two crew members took the "machete" from his boat and tried to take his boat away from him to show it to the police, but he went back in the water and grabbed his boat. He also tried to grab the "machete", but it was already gone.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht anchored approximately 100 meters off Gros Islet, Rodney Bay, St. Lucia, had the dinghy tied alongside during daylight hours.  Two offenders, believed to be aged 6 and 10, swam from Gros Islet out to the boat where they untied the painter from the dinghy. They then swam back ashore with the dinghy and went up into the creek.
 
When the victim noticed the theft he alerted other cruisers via VHF and was taken in another yachts dinghy around the area to look for the stolen dinghy. In the creek locals said they saw two young people swimming up the creek with the dinghy. The dinghy was located further into the creek. The outboard had its lock smashed off and it had been removed from the dinghy. 

Both the dinghy and outboard were recovered. A police report is believed to have been made by the victim. It is understood the witnesses were able to name the offenders involved.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Burglary<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, electronics (tablets, phones), fishing gear, knives, flashlight, clothes<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A family of experienced bareboat charterers anchored their monohull in Wallilabou, SVG and went ashore for dinner at the Anchorage Hotel Restaurant. They were aware and concerned about the brutal assault/murder of a German charterer and the subsequent lack of any arrest/prosecution in that bay in March 2016.  They reviewed the 2015/2016 17th edition cruise guide provided by their charter company, and believed that the author’s comment "The bay has had a reputation for occasional thievery, but it is hoped that a new security system, including video cameras monitored by the coast guard and security guards with flashlights, will put paid to that when anchored off the Wallilabou Anchorage Hotel." They assumed the security system had been put in place. 

They enjoyed dinner ashore and had a full view of the boat from the restaurant. At 8PM when they returned to the boat, however, they discovered that the locked yacht had been burgled.  A forward hatch had been damaged to gain entry. The thieves had thoroughly searched/ransacked all the cabins, lockers and luggage. They found and stole all the hidden cash and personal electronics. They also stole fishing gear, clothing, knives and flashlights. 

The victims contacted the restaurant, who called the police.  Three officers arrived in casual clothes and looked around. They took no notes, pictures or any forensic evidence whatsoever, but claimed they would investigate. The victims provided a list of the stolen items and a signed written statement. The officers promised to send the written declaration to the headquarters of the criminal police department in the capital city of Kingstown. They advised that the only way for the victims to get any written confirmation of this case would require the victims to personally visit Kingstown police HQ. 

The victims arranged transportation to Kingstown police HQ the next day.  There the officers immediately tried to send them away, but the victims insisted and they took their statement (again) in exchange for a $100 ECD fee. Despite repeated requests the police refused to provide a receipt for this payment. They also refused to provide any written confirmation of receipt of the report. The victims used a cell phone to take a picture of their written statement, and a letter they had written to the SVG Chief of Police. The victims were told that an official written report could be picked up in a couple of weeks. Because they planned to have returned to Europe in that timeframe the victims asked that the formal report be sent by email, which the police promised to do. The victims have had NO contact from SVG police or any SVG officials, despite many repeated requests and attempts to contact the responsible persons both by email and telephone. 

CSSN NOTE: Over a year later, the victims decided it was important to tell their story. The business owners and others had implored them NOT to make any public report, and the police had ignored their report and failed to do anything but take their $100 ECD. They did not observe any patrols or video surveillance, those too an empty promise. CSSN has now updated our database to include this report.

Sadly, actions to suppress reporting of crimes is too common by those with economic interests, leaving the larger cruising community unaware and at increased risk. The victims in this case want others to know not only about the misleading information presented in the cruise guide, and the self-serving pleas of the local business interests to not make any information public, but also the disregard of the police and other officials to take any action, including simply providing the paid for and promised written report. 

Timely and complete reports are easy to make, use the CSSN online reporting form. Reporting - it’s everyone’s responsibility. Take a few minutes to review a recently published article published in Caribbean Compass on this important topic.<br>

The crew immediately altered course and turned offshore. When the pirates came closer the crew fired their flare gun directly at the pirates, and nearly hit them. The pirates, apparently understanding the fire hazard a burning flare would pose to their gasoline fueled boat turned away, dropped back and made no further approaches.  The yacht then headed northwest and made safe port at Porlamar, Margarita, where a report was made to local officials.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing yacht with 2 persons onboard departed Belize for Panama via Providencia. Off the Gordo Banks at 5PM at a position of 16*36.700N 082*17.280W they observed a small fishing boat with an enclosure on an intersecting course. They immediately altered course 90 degrees and noticed the small boat continued to attempt to follow. 2 other small fishing boats were spotted about 2-3 miles further away.

Listening to VHF they heard a discussion in Spanish about stealing a dingy (theirs was on the foredeck) and no other vessels were in the vicinity. The crew hailed a merchant vessel located about 15 nmiles away, and one of the small fishing boats made a false response, attempting to impersonate the merchant vessel.  A private VHF DSC call was made to the merchant ship. Radar indicated that the small boats were unable to close the gap into difficult sea and wind conditions, and had fallen further out of range as it became dark.  The yacht continued without lights or AIS transmit.

The next day VHF traffic in Spanish was overheard discussing “keeping a lookout for a white sailboat that got away last night". The yacht continued to Providencia without further incident.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> An in-the-water, but chained-to- the-yacht dinghy was visited by thieves overnight in Chatham Bay, Union Island. Unable to remove the well secured engine or fuel tank,  the thieves settled on the footware - 2 pairs of high end flipflops, both loose in the dinghy,  but covered by a cloth. It was clear that an unsuccessful attempt was made to take the outboard and the fuel tank, both well secured to the dinghy, which was chained to the yacht. The victims wish to share their lesson learned ... clear everything that is not locked from the dinghy.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> Overnight an in the water dinghy went “missing” from a catamaran anchored in Rodney Bay. The next day it was found locked to a marina dock, minus the Yamaha 25HP 2S outboard.  2 local men were there and demanded a reward from the crew to unlock the dinghy. The captain had gone to file a police report and was not available for questions. It is not known if/how the dinghy and outboard were secured, or if the outboard was recovered, or if any “reward” was paid. 

CSSN NOTE: If you are, or know, the owner please contact CSSN to complete an updated online incident report
UPDATE: January 28, 2018 CSSN has received a firsthand report, revising several key aspects of this event. The yacht was not anchored out in the bay, but berthed at Rodney Bay Marina “E” dock. Between 2400-0530 while owner slept onboard, the cable locking the engine, fuel tank and dinghy to a cleat on the catamaran was cut. The 25HP outboard, fuel line and fuel tank were stolen. The next day a young man who worked in the marina complex had found the engineless dinghy and locked it with his own cable to another marina dock. He was paid a small reward. The owner advises that RBM management indicated they did not have CCTV on that dock and that any other coverage from their complex would not be useful. "<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> none, not successful<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Two yachts departed Isla Providencia, Colombia for the Cayman Islands. They traveled northward together on a moonless night with lights and AIS.  They were clear of the Gordo Banks region by about 30 miles. Feeling they were out of the piracy danger zone (see prior reports to CSSN) one of the boats raised full sail and began to pull away just before sunrise. 

 At 9 am the second yacht, a French flagged 51ft. monohull with a family of 5 onboard, at position  16-04.31N/81- 18.51W now more than 100 miles off the Honduran coast , sighted a fishing boat of about 10 meters overloaded with a dozen men onboard on an intersecting course.  They attempted to contact their friends who were still in visual range on VHF 08, (which they had used sparingly overnight), but without success.  They heard another conversation in a strange language/dialect (not Spanish/French/English) that included “barco grande, barco grande”. When they tried to call their friends on VHF 16 the channel was immediately blocked by very loud, continuous music.
 
The suspect pirate boat was able to pull parallel and close to 50 meters, and the occupants displayed a nervous and aggressive attitude.  They were not friendly fishermen wanting to trade. No weapons were visible.

The yacht had put on all remaining sail and then attempted to add the engine, but it failed. Changing course to the SE put the pirate vessel at a disadvantage to the increasing wind and seas and the yacht was able to increase the distance separating the 2 vessels. Eventually the pirates fell back and the yacht turned northward.  The yacht made contact with the French Coast Guard (Cross) by satellite phone, and the French Coast Guard maintained regular contact for the next several hours.
 
At 5 PM, alerted by the French CG, the Honduran navy reached the yacht by satellite phone and advised in English that they were still in danger, and that there were now 2 armed Honduran Naval vessels approaching the area but outside VHF range, who would escort the yacht back to safe port in Honduras. The yacht declined, but welcomed the presence of the Honduran Navy, and continued northward toward their planned destination. 

Overnight and into the next day the French CG maintained regular satellite phone contact with the yacht, and later alerted officials in Cayman about the yachts expected arrival that evening, and their engineless status. They were met and assisted by Cayman CG/port officials to a mooring on arrival. 

CSSN would like to thank the volunteer translators who so kindly assisted with this report.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht transiting northward from Isla Providencia, Columbia to Grand Cayman, at a position of 15-45 N - 81-32 W was off the Gordo banks and traveling dark, and noticed a suspicious vessel on an intercept course from the WSW at 2245 HRS.  At 2315 the suspect vessel was within a few hundred meters, displaying only running lights.  The yacht assumed it was law enforcement and turned on its lights and made 3-4 calls on VHF 16  that were not answered. 

The suspect vessel continued to track on an intercept course and increased speed in clear pursuit. The yacht was now able to identify the large 70+ ft. boat as a fishing trawler type vessel. The yacht was making good speed with full sail and added engine to further increase speed and was able to outpace the suspect vessel, which after 20 minutes gave up the pursuit, then stopped dead and lit up. The captain believes he was a target of opportunity and that the trawler was on the banks to fish.

<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull was 1 of about 9 yachts on PAYS moorings in the bay. When the owners returned to their boat at 1700 HRS they discovered a man inside their boat. He had broken the lock to gain access and rummaged the saloon and cabins in an apparent search for cash (there was none). He jumped overboard as they approached and claimed that he had not taken anything (TRUE) and that there was another man onboard (UNTRUE). The owners called PAYS on VHF and they came to the area ashore and recognized the man, but did not detain him as they believed he had a knife. 

The next day PAYS took one of the owners ashore to meet with the police at a nearby restaurant (that had also had an incident of some sort that the police were investigating). The police did not visit or take any evidence from the yacht, and the PAYS rep named the man to the police. No follow-up information from the police or PAYS has been provided to the victims.<br>

They posted pictures of the items along with a photo of the suspect and his driver's license on the Luperon Cruisers Facebook page. The items were not immediately recognized so a search was made of unoccupied yachts. A caretaker of a sailboat whose owner was away discovered that the locked yacht had been broken into and ransacked and identified the items as belonging to that boat. Charges were filed by the caretaker on the owners behalf, and the items were returned to the yacht.

One of the swimmers began boarding by the stern ladder on the 1st yacht while the other 2 swimmers remained nearby. The observing yacht activated their security lights, and all 3 swimmers lights immediately turned toward the observing yacht, then all 3 of them swam away, passing slowly and close by the 2nd yacht.
 
After nearly an hour, stopping several times to turn and observe the watching yacht, the swimmers exited at the beach. The yacht departed at first light, and no police report was made.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull anchored in an area north of the Marigot Bay harbor and south of Castries. No other yachts were nearby.

All 3 onboard went for a snorkel nearby (about 30 meters away) and did not lock the boat. A local transport boat was waiting to unload and anchored about 100 meters away and witnessed the boarding and theft that occurred during the 30-40 minutes the crew was snorkeling. One swimmer kept a watch while 3 others boarded and ransacked the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, iPhones, iPad, a purse and rum, leaving behind wet footprints that the victims discovered on their return. 

The witnesses on the nearby boat assisted the victims in making contact with the police. The victims made their first report at the local police station and were told to collect it at a different station. Two days later at the second station, the report seemed to have been “misplaced” when they went to collect it, and they were told to return the next day. They returned, but the report could still not be found, so a new report was completed.  
 
The victims indicate that the police seemed disinterested, and they failed to collect any meaningful information (a good description of one of the thieves was available, but not recorded). The subsequent investigation onboard included only photos of areas irrelevant to the theft, and no forensic/fingerprint analysis.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> not successfully boarded, deterred by large dog<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A panga with 4+ men attempted to board a cruising yacht anchored in the bay at around 2300 HRS.  Surprised, the owner came on deck and responded aggressively verbally, and was only able to dissuade the hostile boarders when his large, 60 lb. dog came on deck.  Holstered pistols were visible to the captain.

After departing the panga lit up and then attempted to engage with another nearby yacht.  The owner spoke Spanish and after much angry yelling the panga departed.  Earlier this same night a cruising yacht was boarded by armed men, and the occupants’ pistol whipped and robbed at gun point. See Prior report. (LINK)<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> <br>
<b>SECURED:</b> <br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> During a night transit from Chaguaramas, Trinidad to Grenada at 0400 hours and approximately 6 nm South of the Hibiscus gas platform, a boat about a mile ahead and slightly off to port of the yachts track suddenly switched on an array of nonstandard lights, including a flashing red/green light, and two or three hand held lights. The yachts crew were monitoring VHF 16 and could not determine what this boat was doing or its intentions.

 After a while they passed it port side to at about a quarter of a mile. The boat then motored around astern of the yacht, and began to follow, gradually closing to about 100yds astern over the next 20 minutes. Once it became clear they were being followed, the yacht went dark, all navigation lights and other visible lighting were doused. Defensive equipment was made ready on deck, and full speed on engine and full sail was made, approximately 7kts.
 
After an additional  20 minutes the suspect vessel dropped back, and once far enough away, the yacht changed course 60 degrees with intermittent further changes over time to make themselves more difficult to find, and to keep well clear of the normal Hibiscus direct route to Grenada. The crew had no doubt they had been checked out as a possible target for attack, and a full report was made to TTCG.

<b>DETAILS:</b> A private yacht with 3 of 7 crew onboard was approached by 6 men armed with handguns, using the pretense of selling water at 2130 HRS. They boarded aggressively and hit one crew member in the head with a gun and then spent considerable time ransacking the boat, terrorizing the crew that was made to lay on the floor all the while the armed boarders repeatedly yelled “cocaine, cocaine”.  Cash, phones, computers and electronics were taken.  Jewelry was left behind, no drugs were (found) onboard. 

Coincidentally,  the yachts tender, with the 4 remaining crew returned to the boat, which hastened the thieves’ departure without making further direct contact.   A full police report was made, to local police and Aeronaval. 

CSSN NOTE: Attempts to board other yachts in the anchorage were made this same night most likely by this same group of armed thieves.  One later boarding was only deterred when the owner’s large dog made its presence known on deck. (See next report)    Details of some other attempts/boardings are incomplete. If you were a victim, of a boarding or attempted boarding, PLEASE contact CSSN and complete an online incident report. (LINK to online form)

CSSN UPDATE 02/02/2019 : This report has been updated to reflect its new firsthand status. Additionally, the victims reported this incident shortly after it occurred to their consular officials in Panama. They have had followup contact with the police in Panama. However, there have been no results in the investigation – no arrests or any recovery of the stolen items. Police did visit the yacht, but did not collect any forensic evidence.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A 50 ft. catamaran with 5 persons onboard departed Fernando De Noronha, Brazil on 19 January 2019, northbound. To avoid small ships, their routing kept them well off the South American coast, 170 - 200 miles, in international waters.  Before approaching the area of Trinidad and Tobago, they filed a float plan with the Trinidad/Tobago Coast Guard and monitored VHF 16/68 continuously. 

After passing 50 miles to the east of Tobago, at 8 PM on February 2, at position LAT: 12.27.0 N LONG: 060.47.39 W (approximately 66 miles north of Tobago and 38 miles off the east coast of  Grenada) the watch detected a white and red light on the horizon, approaching.

The captain was awoken and confirmed that the light configuration had not altered course or changed bearing. The yachts radar MARPA target confirmed that there was no change on the vessels course. The yacht took immediate avoiding action, turning hard to starboard to pass the vessel port to port. The vessel altered its course to intercept the new course of the yacht. Another avoiding action was taken by the yacht, turning hard to port to pass starboard to the now suspect vessel. The suspect vessel yet again took an intercepting course and MARPA indicated a collision and an increase in speed of the suspect vessel to 6 knots. 

The yacht turned on its port engine and furled the sails and turned hard to starboard again. The suspect vessel yet again took an intercepting course and had now closed to about 2 miles. The suspect vessel turned on red and blue flashing lights in an attempt to approach the yacht, but made no radio contact.  The suspect vessel continued its intercept approach and ended up within 200 meters while displaying red and blue flashing lights. 

The captain and crew recognized the ruse and non-legitimate nature of the light display. The yacht went dark, and engaged the starboard engine. With both engines at full rpm, they fled the impostor vessel at approximately 11 knots.  The impostor vessel appeared limited to a speed of 6 knots, and continued its pursuit, but did not identify itself via AIS or make any radio contact. The yacht continued to make course changes over the next several hours as the impostor vessel continued to follow. The yacht arrived in Carriacou the following day, and made reports to Customs and Immigration officials there.
 
CSSN NOTE: Legitimate marine/law enforcement officials (Trinidad/Tobago, Grenada, USCG) do NOT display flashing red/blue lights, the international standard is flashing/strobe blue, and make clear their intentions to approach closely/board with radio contact or loud hailer.<br>

They immediately began shouting and swimming back towards their vessel, which alerted others on boats in the anchorage who also began shouting at the intruder, who then jumped off the yacht and swam back to his boat and then motored away. Owners returned to their yacht and used their dinghy to pursue the individual, who had moored off the beach. When confronted he said he “did not steal anything”, and “sorry”.  Vessels in the anchorage were notified by VHF, and the marina dock master was provided a picture of the intruder’s boat.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> CSSN PRELIMINARY REPORT :    A 53’ Trinidad flagged monohull transiting from Trinidad to Grenada with 2 persons onboard was approached by 8 pirates in an open piroque at 10:30 AM, at approximate position 11-24N, 61-36W, about 16 miles NNE of the Hibiscus gas platform, and 37 miles south of Grenada. 

The pirates 40 ft. boat had 2 large outboards, was white/blue with an orange bow and approached from the east. The pirates fired warning shots into the air and indicated they wished the yacht to stop. It did not. Additional warning shots were fired as the helmsman attempted to use the VHF radio, which he did not. High seas prevented the piroque from successfully approaching and boarding as the yacht maintained full speed and began zigzag maneuvers.  Additional shots were then fired at the boat and helmsman, damaging the hull and coach roof, but no injuries were sustained. 

The pirates gave up and fled the area at high speed to the west. Reports were made by the victims on arrival in Grenada to both Grenada and Trinidad/Tobago Coast Guard (TTCG). 

Yachting Services Association Trinidad/Tobago (YSATT) indicates that TTCG are on “High Alert” and have added assets and increased patrols in the area.  As the overall situation in nearby Venezuela is not expected to improve, plans are being formulated to form escort/convoys.  Float plans filed with TTCG and North Post Radio remain the best method for communicating with officals there.

Additional details are expected and CSSN will update this report when they are received.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> everything from deck, 12 scuba tanks, RIB dinghy, liferaft , all dive gear, stern anchor , all navigation electronics +<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A Canadian flagged yacht with 4 persons onboard departed Roatan, Honduras for Isla Providencia, Colombia. At 1742 HRS, at a position of 14-50N, 82-47W, approximately 23 miles ESE of Cabo Gracias a Dios, they were approached by 2 local fishing boats (pangas) with about 10-12 men. Initially they asked for food and drink, which the crew provided.  The 2 pangas drifted back a bit and were seen making calls on handheld VHF radios. Two (2) additional pangas then arrived, and all 4 (now 20-25 men in total) surrounded the yacht, and began ramming the yacht, damaging the stern ladder and swim platform, damaging the hull on both sides, and then began boarding the yacht. 

The crew had begun MAYDAY calls on VHF and retreated and secured themselves safely below, protected by interior security bars that covered all hatches and companionways. Mayhem ensued topsides, as the pirates ransacked and destroyed sails, halyards, cushions, etc. The pirates used fishing knives and the yacht&#39;s heavy winch handles to smash all port lights, the pilothouse windows, and the plexiglass hatch (which they then discovered was protected by interior security bars). The pirates proceeded to steal all electronic and navigation equipment, scuba tanks, scuba gear, the yachts RIB dinghy, liferaft and various other items.
 
The crew continued with VHF MAYDAY calls (no response) and activated DSC (no response). They activated the SOS function on their inReach satellite communicator and received prompt text replies, indicating the Nicaraguan Navy had been informed of the situation, but could not give a time of arrival on the scene. After about 40 minutes the pirates had seemingly exhausted themselves, and stolen, discarded overboard or destroyed almost everything within reach of the topsides.
 
The 4 pangas departed back toward the Nicaraguan coast. The yacht proceeded under power and set course directly away from the coast, to Providencia, and arrived there the next afternoon having had no contact from the Nicaraguan Navy.  Reports were made to the Colombian Port Captain and Coast Guard. Some repairs were effected and the yacht will soon continue on to Panama, where further repairs will be made and a report will be made to Canadian consular officials.
  
This event differed in some respects from prior small boat piracy events in the region. Please review the CSSN Central America regional Piracy Zoom-Tap, Know&amp;Go interactive infographic for complete information on those events, and review the CSSN region specific Piracy Precautions – Central America page.  A well thought out and executed plan protected this crew from physical harm.

<b>DETAILS:</b> CSSN PRELIMINARY Report
 
CSSN has verified a limited number of facts with the victims’ designated representative. The situation remains dynamic as the investigation by Panamanian authorities moves forward, and the legal process follows. 

Three pirates boarded the family yacht, located near Dad Naggwe Dubbir island in the Guna Yala/San Blas islands of Panama in the early hours of May 2, 2019. The captain died of wounds received in the attack, and other family members were injured.  Three suspects were taken into custody in the Colon jurisdiction.

<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Two occupants asleep aboard a catamaran anchored in Placencia harbor, Belize were awakened by noise around 03:45 am. The vessel owner witnessed an adult male boarder exiting the cockpit overboard from port transom, capsizing his fishing canoe in his haste to escape. The boarder spoke to owner as he swam away, "I'm sinking, sir." Owner clearly saw his face.
Subsequently, the vessel occupants observed water on the floor in the saloon and discovered cash was stolen from a wallet (approx. US$120). The occupants noticed the overturned canoe drifting away and the owner launched the dinghy, retrieved the canoe, and secured it to the vessel.
After daybreak, the owner went ashore and made a full report of the incident to the Placencia Police and reviewed mug shots, identifying several individuals that could have been the intruder. The Police retrieved the canoe as evidence. The Police refused to provide a copy of the Police Report to the vessel owner on the grounds that it was "privacy information." The owner went to the local tourist office to also report the incident there, but the office was closed. The owner alerted other cruising vessels in the area (~25 yachts) of the incident via VHF broadcast and answered all questions. The victim vessel departed Placencia later that morning and did not receive any further communication from the Placencia Police. <br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing vessel enroute from Providencia, Columbia to the Bay Islands, Honduras at 16 27.700' N 84 50.914' W at 22:45 sighted two boats off their bow approximately 5 nm away. The crew on the vessel began monitoring a conversation on VHF 16 in Spanish involving three boats after hearing the word “velero” (sailboat). The VHF conversation eventually seemed to suggest that a plan was being made to attack the yacht. One of the captains was heard to say “I have no fish in my boat, let's see if we can put something else in it.” At this point, the yacht went dark and changed course 60-90 degrees to starboard. After about 30 minutes, one of the vessels that had been sighted was determined to be approaching on an intercepting course. This boat was raised on the bow and the stern like a typical Caribbean steel fishing boat of ~60 feet. About 1 hour later at 16 29.157'N, 84 58.678'W, the vessel had approached within 500ft but then stopped. VHF 16 conversation resumed with one captain calling the other two boats, only one of which responded to hails. The yacht continued its course at maximum speed, with no further pursuit. A report was made to the port captain in Roatan after arrival.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing vessel departed the Rio Dulce, Guatemala intending to visit Utila, Honduras. They were motor sailing in light winds and at 8:00 AM, they were about 10 miles off the coast and were boarded by pirates. 4 men boarded (2 armed with handguns) and 1 remained in the open fishing boat. 

The pirates were very aggressive, and fired their guns several times very close to the heads of the crew to ensure compliance. The crew spoke French and pretended not to “understand” while the boat was ransacked for about 1 hour. 

The pirates took everything they could, while taking no precautions to conceal their identities. Once satisfied with their haul they departed in the direction of the Honduran coast. 

There were no injuries to the crew. The yacht was able to make radio contact with the Puerto Cortes naval base and routed there to make reports to the Coast Guard, Police and Port Captain.<br>

Two men remained in the panga, while the 4 remaining pirates began pilfering the boat, roughing up the female crew member as she retrieved the demanded cash.  During the 15 minutes they were ransacking the yacht the pirates took hand held electronics, a wall mounted TV, cash, alcohol, dive gear, and passports, as well as the RIB dinghy/outboard which was launched off the deck. The pirates departed to retrieve the dinghy and the yacht continued onward to Roatan.  The captain believes his compliant and non-threatening posture prevented injury or worse.

After a difficult night with limited navigation and communications capability their radio call was answered by a US Navy surveillance airplane, that then overflew them and arranged for continued airborne escort to Roatan. The US Navy had arranged a warm welcome and official reports were made to the police, port captain and Honduran coast guard. The supporting consulates provided additional assistance with communications and passport replacement.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull transiting from Providencia, Colombia to the Bay Islands, Honduras was approached by a white pilothouse fishing vessel ~ 45ft on June 27 at 00:00, position 16 20.486' N 82 57.469' W. The yacht deviated to starboard 20 degrees and the fishing vessel matched course change to follow. The yacht again deviated to starboard and started their engine and increased speed to 8 knots. The suspect vessel again took an intercept course and closed to within 150ft, then matched the yacht’s speed and tried to come along aside. At this point, the yacht released sails and made a hard turn to port, passing behind the stern of the other vessel. They shut off all lights, changed course again and motorsailed at 8 knots away from the vessel. The suspect vessel initially turned to follow but did not increase speed and eventually resumed its original course. No attempt to contact on VHF 16 was made by either vessel. The sailboat continued its course to Roatan and encountered suspicious activity the following night (see related report). A report was made to the Port Captain in Roatan after arrival.<br>

<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, personal communication devices, laptops, entertainment electronics, videocameras, credit cards, satellite phone, drone, EPIRB<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull with 2 persons on board departed Linton Bay, Panama for the San Blas islands. Engine issues caused the yacht to make an unplanned stop in Bahia Nombre de Dios, where no other boats were anchored.  The necessary repairs were completed but the hour was late and entering the San Blas in the dark was not an option. The crew planned to lock themselves in securely for the night.

They were down below and surprised just after sunset at 1930 HRS by noise on deck. The captain went up to the cockpit and was ambushed and then restrained by 2 swimmers who had boarded and concealed themselves behind opposite sides of the spray hood.  Immediately a boat with 4 other men arrived and the captain was held at gunpoint, and then forced back down into the cabin. He had alerted his crew and she had locked herself into a cabin. There were now 6 men onboard, with their faces concealed by t-shirts. The leader held a semiautomatic handgun to the captain’s head.  The crew decided the cabin would not remain safe and decided to cooperate fully and came out of the cabin.

For 45 minutes the men ransacked and inspected every space in the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, phones, cameras and video equipment, laptops, a drone, EPIRB, etc. Several of the items were well concealed. Some of the men appeared to be high on drugs, and were only marginally under the control of the armed leader. Two of the men forced the crew member back into a cabin and indicated they intended to rape her, but the leader prevented this.  Once they had collected all things of value all 6 men departed in their boat.

Finally, certain the men had departed the crew exited the cabin and untied the captain. They upped anchor to return to Linton Bay. They noticed their EPIRB blinking in the water near shore, apparently it had been dropped in the water and self-activated. The crew activated DSC and called pan pan on VHF but had NO response. AIS showed large ships nearby. The yacht arrived back at Linton Bay at 2200 HRS.

The Linton Bay marina security team noticed the bright light the crew was waving and went immediately to the anchored yacht. After understanding the situation marina personnel acted quickly and contacted Aeronaval (coastguard) who arrived in a few minutes from their nearby station. Some photos were taken and they indicated they would return with police on Monday, (24+ HRS later). Which they did, and they transported the victims to an inland town to make a formal police report. After many hours waiting no report was made due to the lack of a translator. A second meeting was scheduled and the translator was available and the formal report finally made 2 days later.  Follow up sessions to collect forensics on the boat were scheduled for later in the week. The victims have informed their consular officials who are expected to assist.

CSSN NOTE: Unintentionally the water activated EPIRB fulfilled part of its intended purpose. After quick confirmation from the owner’s shore side contacts, who had up to date travel plans for the yacht, it was recognized that the unexpected “land” location was an emergency. Direct contact was then made with a nearby (2miles) police station and Aeronaval station (5 miles) but no action was taken by either. DSC and pan pan calls by the yacht did not generate any response or assistance.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> While monohull owners slept onboard in their forward cabin, thieves stole the lifted and locked to the yacht dinghy from its davits at the stern. The thieves arrived prepared with bolt cutters and knives and defeated both the stainless steel locks, that had exposed hasps/shackles (for the outboard to the dinghy, and the dinghy to the yacht). They cut numerous retaining lines, and the davit lines, but were unable to cut the dyneema bridle/harness.

Apparently, the thieves misjudged the weight of the 30HP outboard and it, as well as the small rowboat type dinghy they had used were found the next day underwater, sunk to the bottom below the yacht. Both were retrieved. The RIB dinghy had been set adrift, and was found 8 miles offshore by another yacht, and returned to the owners. All of the items in the dinghy were untouched. A police report was made, and the coast guard notified.<br>

The lock on the companionway had been compromised, and was found with some sort of lock pick left stuck inside. The interior was completely ransacked and owners have not yet determined what was stolen, but few valuables had been left in the boat. A police report was filed and the marina management notified. Unfortunately the security cameras on premises were not operational. A police investigation is expected next week.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull anchored in an area north of the Marigot Bay harbor and south of Castries. No other yachts were nearby.

All 3 onboard went for a snorkel nearby (about 30 meters away) and did not lock the boat. A local transport boat was waiting to unload and anchored about 100 meters away and witnessed the boarding and theft that occurred during the 30-40 minutes the crew was snorkeling. One swimmer kept a watch while 3 others boarded and ransacked the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, iPhones, iPad, a purse and rum, leaving behind wet footprints that the victims discovered on their return. 

The witnesses on the nearby boat assisted the victims in making contact with the police. The victims made their first report at the local police station and were told to collect it at a different station. Two days later at the second station, the report seemed to have been “misplaced” when they went to collect it, and they were told to return the next day. They returned, but the report could still not be found, so a new report was completed.  
 
The victims indicate that the police seemed disinterested, and they failed to collect any meaningful information (a good description of one of the thieves was available, but not recorded). The subsequent investigation onboard included only photos of areas irrelevant to the theft, and no forensic/fingerprint analysis.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> UPDATED REPORT: This report replaces our prior preliminary report. The victims made contact with CSSN and provided additional details about the event.
 
A monohull sailing yacht with 4 men and 2 women onboard departed Linton Bay and due to unfavorable conditions made an unplanned stop in Bahia Nombre de Dios, anchoring there at about 13:00 HRS. There were no other yachts present in the bay.
  
At about 19:00 HRS, just after dark they were approached and overrun by 8 men who arrived in 3-4 pangas (engineless boats). The men concealed their faces and had hand guns (1 semi-automatic and a revolver) and knives. The crew was restrained and for approximately 45 minutes the men stole everything they could - cash, personal devices, boat electronics and gear, clothing, liquor and cigarettes.
 
After the robbers departed the crew was able to remove their restraints and they returned to Linton Bay and berthed at the marina. The women were taken to the hospital for evaluation/treatment. Reports were made to the police, CG, port captain, and the home country consular officials contacted. 
 
The Panamanian police began their investigation and have made 6 arrests as of 12 November 2019.
 
CSSN NOTE: There have been similar incidents reported in this same bay in the recent past. The first occurred in July 2019, and the most recent less than a week prior.<br>
