<b>Notes/Details:</b> This house is alleged to have a haunted bathroom. It is said that late one night a woman was home alone and decided to use the restroom. On the toilet, she saw a smallish looking person. It is also reported that late one night, sounds that appeared to be water dripping euphoniously came from the restroom. When it was checked, there were no leaky faucets. No one seems to know why the bathroom is haunted.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> In 1884 Sarah Winchester, heiress of the Winchester Rifle fortune, began construction on a Victorian-style mansion. Driven by her supposed guilt over the many deaths her husband’s rifle business caused, Sarah paid a veritable army of construction workers and craftsmen to build the sprawling 160-room house over the course of nearly forty years. Devastated by the untimely deaths of both her husband and baby daughter and thinking them to be connected to the shooting deaths of many victims of the Winchester rifle, Sarah was supposedly told that continually building the rambling home would appease (or in some cases perhaps trap) the spirits and lift a curse. People hear mysterious voices, footsteps and doors slamming shut. Cold spots and strange lights appear and then fade away.<br>

The mischief-maker seems to be the spirit of a little girl who died there when she was only six. Some say she died in the hotel, some claim it was in the house that caught fire.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> This site, which now lies deep in the woods, was once a mental institution for many “crazy” children in the 1930s. There is also a hospital associated with the abandoned cabins that lies 10 miles away. The children, who were violent or depressed, were sent here for treatment. Children who misbehaved were strapped to the beds with belts and beaten until they were unconscious. Many the children were killed and due to this cruelty, the facility was closed and the gate around the hospital’s perimeter was chained closed. Many have seen not only lights in the windows, but shadows of children as well.<br>

Cold breezes, footsteps, unexplained noises, and even unpleasant physical feelings have been reported. The owner of the building has had the motion detectors go off when no one was there. The events coinciding with the annual haunted house fundraisers ceased earlier this decade, but the strange happenings did not.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The old swimming pools are also the sites of frequent sightings. Visitors have reported women in wearing swimsuits from the 1930s walking the pool decks. Others have heard splashing or spotted fresh wet footprints. Near one of the pools people have even seen a little girl, sometimes clutching a teddy bear, and at other times calling for her mommy and dolly. Is this the ghost of the little girl, named Jackie, who drowned while the Queen Mary played ocean liner? Or is it the little girl supposedly quite precocious and a child who enjoyed sliding down banisters who went for a slide and got bucked off when the ship hit a huge swell, the child’s neck snapping as a result of sudden impact? Perhaps the two have even found each other and play together, as many report hearing childish laughter.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Kate Morgan was supposedly a grifter working the rails in the late 1800s with her husband, Thomas. The two set up poker games on trains all across the country, pretending to be brother and sister so that Kate could use her wiles to help blindside the playing men. They were gifted cheats, but it seems (according to somewhat reluctant eyewitness testimony) they got into a lover’s spat and Kate drifted into the Del, signing in under the name of Lottie Bernard (a passenger on the same train she had recently ridden). Logging in to the Del just before Thanksgiving of 1892, “Lottie Bernard” carried no luggage and looked to be in poor health and a poorer state of mind. She essentially told the staff not to worry about her, she claimed her brother (a Dr. M. C. Anderson) would arrive shortly with her luggage. He would take care of her. People have claimed to see a woman dressed in the proper period and style as Kate paging through books and walking the halls. Lights flicker on and off in Kate’s room and the sheets and blankets are played with. In the gift shop, the Marilyn Monroe merchandise used to literally jump off the shelves when it had a prominent place, but stopped its crazy behavior when it was moved to a less visible location.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Built in 1893, this high school is shrouded by a number of ghost stories. Two of the stories involve the locker room just beneath the stage. In one case, the lead actress in a play was strangled in the locker room by a jealous understudy. The understudy simply went on the stage and took the murdered girl’s place. If one stands on the balcony at night and shines a red light on center stage, he will be confront by a girl in a polka dot dress. In the other story, a girl was waiting for an audition and was raped and killed by an unknown man. Today, if one is in the locker room when all is quiet, he will hear rapid breathing and faint moans. Often, there are allegedly cool breezes accompanied by the feeling of fingers brushing lightly across the neck and shoulders.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> During the revolutionary war, after Gen. Washington met with the French General at the War College in Lebanon, the two armies set out marching to the battlefields of New York and New Jersey..They camped overnight in what is now Amston.The area is a hill crest at the end of Ames Rd., on the left. Stone fire circles are in evidence, left by the troopers, as are occasional artifacts found by hikers. However, while they were encamped in Amston, above the lake, a strange malady overcame the troops, and over thirty were known to have died. At the time, old Indian curses were blamed, and the dead were buried on site.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> In 1987, the story centers on Matthew Campbell, who is being treated for Hodgkins Lymphoma in a hospital in Upstate Connecticut. After seeing the effect the long commute has on Matt, his family rents a nearby house, which they learn was previously a funeral home. They discover a mortuary room in the basement and the family begins experiencing violent and supernatural events that the parents initially blame on stress and hallucinations from Matt's treatment. Matt also experiences visions from the perspective of a young man named Jonah, who Matt said he has been seeing every day since he moved to the house. Matt contacts a minister he met at the hospital for assistance with his paranormal experiences. The minister informs Matt that the visions and supernatural encounters are likely a result of the previous occupant's occult activities. This particular haunting was made into a movie in 2009.<br>

One particular area on the ride, called the "burning city", required George to climb up quite high above the ground. George lost his balance, and fell to his death. If you talk to any of the employees at pirates, they will either know of someone who has had an incident with George, or there is a chance they move have had one themselves.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The building that is now a college used to be the Ponce de Leon Hotel, run by Henry Flagler and his mentally unstable wife. After their daughter died, Mrs. Flagler hanged herself on the fourth floor of the hotel. The building, which is also the girls dormitory is plagued by many strange events. Girls on the third floor constantly hear ballroom music above them, although the 4th floor is sealed off. One girl reportedly went into hysterics because her bed began to shake wildly, though no one was in the room with her. Though they need the space, administrators will not allow students to room on the fourth floor.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The ghost of a man who died in the 1840's is seen here. He is seen often as a shadowy figure in period clothing in the cemetery, the adjacent woods and the fields across the street. The apparition is known as Benjamin Miles, a local settler who is buried there in an unmarked grave. It is said that this is a particularly angry and dangerous spirit. His presence is accompanied by a chill in the air and the call of an owl. The sound of that owl is said to be a warning that Benjamin Miles is nearby. All of these phenomena are almost always seen at night usually in the fall and winter seasons.<br>

He is said to be a bearded, blue-eyed man in a blue coat and hat. Footsteps are heard moving across the stage when no one is present. On one stage wall, there is an image of a knife that simply will not go away–it has been covered by twenty coats of paint! Users of the theater do maintain, however, hat Captain is actually very friendly and does not harm anyone.<br>

Upon her death, he received a letter from her, indicating that she had never forgotten him either. The fountain was taken down in a renovation, but guests still report seeing the young couple walking hand in hand on the same spot.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The road is marked by the sign of the devil 666 atop a dead end sign at the end of the street. Allegedly, the grim reaper stands in the middle of the road as cars approach. Just as the car is about to mow him over, the reaper vanishes into a puff of smoke. When the victims return the next day, burn marks tell exactly where the reaper appeared. Also on the road is Haunted Bridge. Legend says that young couple came around the curve too fast and fell of the bridge to a watery grave. It is alleged that if one stops his car on the bridge, he will be guided to safety. Bare footprints have been reported on rainy nights. Many others have also put powdered sugar on their car and reported hand prints after leaving the bridge.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The theater is believed to be haunted by the spirit of an old stagehand named "Red". There really was a stagehand nicknamed "Red" who worked at the Lincoln Theater during the vaudeville days. Red also had only one arm but he did not lose it (along with his life) in a horrific accident. He was a veteran of World War I and he had lost his arm during the fighting in Europe. When he returned to Decatur, he took a job as a stagehand at the Lincoln and soon became a "novelty" because he managed to do all of his work with one arm. In fact, he was faster than many of the other stagehands (most who were much younger than he was) at pulling the ropes and lowering the lights and they were using both of their arms. Red was a likable man and completely devoted to the theater. This was perhaps the reason he was so memorable to later generations of staff members as the "stagehand who never left the theater". - Copied from http://www.haunteddecatur.com/lincoln.html<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> "Located just off Morgan and Sangamon Streets is a round, dilapidated structure that looks much like a medieval castle tower with battlements around the top of it. The tower has not weathered well over the years, falling into obscurity and then being forgotten, much like the business it once belonged to. Over the years, the stories of ghosts and weird happenings surrounding the tower are better remembered than those who built it.Grain production mills and disastrous fires have long gone hand in hand, thanks to the volatile conditions needed to manufacture the product. Strangely though, no one could explain the mysterious fire that swept through a portion of the Shellabarger mill in February 1923, as the mill had been closed down for almost three years. The exact amount of damage from the fire is unknown, but the blaze did destroy most of the structures in the complex, leaving only this tower and a few nearby buildings." - Copied from http://www.haunteddecatur.com/shellabarger.html<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Back in the 1950's, a Bride and Groom came to Cumberland Falls State Park for their Honeymoon. The couple decided to take in some of sites at the falls area before going back to their room at the lodge. Before leaving the falls they wanted to have their photos the with the falls in the background. The couple found an overlook just a few hundred feet from the falls that would work great for the photo. As the Bride stood on the Pillars at the edge of the 75 to 80 foot cliff, the Bride lost her balance and fell to her death. This place is now called "Lovers Leap". There have been reports of people driving around the last curve and hitting a woman that seems to be wearing a wedding dress and when they go to look for her, she is no where to be found.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> During the early twentieth century, Louisville had the highest tuberculosis rate in the country, so a hospital was opened. Many of the patients remained here until they died. The dead bodies were pushed down tunnels to the bottom of the hill where they were then carried off and buried. After the vaccine for tuberculosis was discovered, the hospital became a nursing home that is also now closed. Now, an elderly woman may be seen running from the building with bleeding wrists and ankles, she begs for someone to get her out of that place. Many have also seen people peeking out of third floor the residential ward windows.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> A pioneer in the automotive industry, Mr. Whaley and his wife brought a large Victorian mansion. Now a local historic site, the house is allegedly haunted. It is said that contractors were remodeling the house when suddenly something or someone threw a plastic tarp over the second floor banister. The tarp levitated for several seconds before finally floating to the ground. It is alleged that if one enters the house, the very strong presence of a female, perhaps Mrs. Whaley, can be felt.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Three theatres were built in 1971, and in 1979 a fourth one was added. During the process of building, a worker was killed. Soon after construction was completed, many strange happenings were witnessed on the premises. Seats in the front row have rocked on their own, garbage cans rolled up the aisle, cans knocked over by themselves, lights flicker on their own, toilets have randomly flushed, and many others. These strange events have been witnessed by numerous patrons and employees. Over time, the employees nicknamed the ghost “Johnny”. The theatres closed on January 17, 1999 due to a lease expiration. In March of 1999, a group of former employees visited theatre four, said, “Hi.” to Johnny, and the lights mysteriously turned on.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Many years ago, before the theater was built on this site, the land was used for farming. Supposedly, six people died on this farm for unknown reasons. The employees of the theater have reported paranormal activity throughout the building. Such activity includes toilets flushing on their own, strange noises, figures appearing in the theater seats after hours, and the sighting of a tall man with a beard, wearing overalls.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The Bowers Harbor Inn is famous for its haunting. Before becoming a resort the house belonged to an elderly couple for many years. Because the lady became quite infirm the husband had an elevator installed. The lady became rather deranged before finally dying, preceding her husband by only a few months. After that the house lay empty for several years. From the time the Bowers Harbor Inn began operating, the employees have reported seeing the wife in a second floor mirror, light switches that turn off and on by themselves, and the elevator taking unrequested trips up and down. Several times the manager has closed the place down for the evening, turning all of the lights off and locking the freezer door, only to find every light in the building (including those behind locked doors) blazing away, and the freezer door unlocked and standing open. There are also unconfirmed reports by patrons of the fireplaces lighting themselves.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Many workers at this site have claimed to hear odd noises in the buildings, and have witnessed items, such as lights, being turned on randomly. One worker was locked in a basement room, and despite his best efforts, could not even budge the door. Finally, the general manager came to his aid only to find that the door was unlocked and opened easily. There is a rumor that a family cemetery was somehow lost when a man planned to develop the property. This occurrence could be the cause for some of the paranormal disturbances on the site.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> This present restaurant, which has been a hotel, a stagecoach shop, and a brothel is said to be plagued by phantoms. There are reports of toilets flushing and faucets running when no one is in the bathroom. The ghosts are said to be both male and female. They also appear to be very domestically oriented as it is said they have turned on the vacuum cleaner and began vacuuming several times. Reportedly, a seance was held and the ghosts said they were only doing these things because they wanted to help run the business that was once theirs. When the seance was broken, it is said a shelf came crashing down.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Many years ago, an overweight slightly mentally ill child named Tommy ran a mile in 14 minutes and 41 seconds, the worst time in school history. After being teased by his peers, the boy referred to as Tommy Dummy was determined to run the mile faster. One weekend, Tommy went to the field and ran the mile alone in under ten minutes. This is known only because he corpse was found at the finish line the following Monday grasping his stopwatch. Since then, each time students run the mile, they feel cold spots around the field, especially where the body was found. On foggy mornings, others report seeing an apparition jogging around the field. It is further alleged that watches cease to work just as anyone is nearing the finish line, thus no one can ever get an accurate time. Oddly the second hand is always said to stop on 14 or 41 seconds past the minute.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Eastern State Penitentiary was designed by John Haviland, and was constructed between 1822-1836 on farmland outside the city of Philadelphia. The prison was opened in 1829. It became one of the most famous prisons in the world, and approximately 300 other prisons all around the world were constructed based on its design. Like most old prisons, there are many ghost stories about Eastern State Penitentiary. Many people have claimed to see ghostly figures roaming the halls. The most commonly seen ghost is that of a inmate who killed twenty-seven men during an attempted prison break. In addition to seeing the ghostly figures, many people also hear strange sounds.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Nemacolin Castle was built by the Bowman family. It started out as a small building that was used as a trading post along the Monongahela River in 1789. Nelson Bowman, who was a member of the 2nd generation of the Bowman family to live in the house, built onto the original building to create the structure as it is today. The house is rumored to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. There are many secret hiding spaces in the house, however, there is no documentation to prove that it actually was a part of the Underground Railroad. Nemacolin Castle is supposedly very haunted. There are at least ten ghosts that have been seen during tours. All of the ghosts are friendly. Sometimes they show themselves, other times people just feel cold spots, hear unexplainable sounds, see movement out of the corner of their eyes, or catch orbs on film. Two of the ghosts that are often seen are Elizabeth, a "prim and proper" lady, and Mary, a seven year old girl with dark, curly hair.<br>

<b>Location (approx Is Ok):</b> Historic Jean Bonnet Tavern, Bedford, PA<br>
<b>Type Of Activity:</b> "Known for his prankish nature, the spirit of a man hung in the tavern, back in the 1700s, has been seen many times sitting at the bar, and again in the same area he was hung. The man was suspected of being a French Spy. At that time France was considered the enemy by the British Army. His body was buried under the floor so the French wouldn't find him.  In the 1950s Historic Jean Bonnet Tavern was taken over by a new owner who decided to replace the the floor boards in the old tavern. A skeleton of a man was found. Later the skeleton was tested and proven to date back to the 1700s. There have been many eye witnesses to seeing a group of old fashioned looking people, dressed like prospectors, watching the different shows and holiday attractions offered at Jean Bonnet Tavern.Several employees and guests have reported hearing a piano playing, or a noisy party going on, only to find there is no one sitting at the old piano or anyone having a party. Many times the witness was alone in the tavern.Visitors have complained of someone touching them when there was nobody nearby. Many recent visitors and employees have seen forks fly off the tables for no apparent reason.  Visitors have taken pictures around the Jean Bonnet Tavern and have seen spirit-like figures sitting at the tables and bar area." - Quoted from http://www.pennsylvania-mountains-of-attractions.com/ghosthauntings.html.<br>

<b>Location (approx Is Ok):</b> Royer Mansion, 3909 Piney Creek Road, Williamsburg, PA<br>
<b>Type Of Activity:</b> "According to a story written by Paranormal Investigator, Patty Wilson, while visiting the Royer Mansion a friend of hers stepped outside for a few moments. When he returned he told them of hearing children playing behind the Spring-house. He went on to tell them while he was walking around to the side of the house and saw children in old fashioned clothing playing. There was a boy of about 3 or 4 years old. Even though there is a fence around the Spring-house he didn't see a fence in his vision. He watched the boy climb down into the creek that flows through the Spring-house and then heard the screams of a woman. The woman rushed down into the creek and picked the boy up but he was dead from drowning. There has never been a report on record of a child drowning at Royer Mansion. But that is not unusual since there is a large era the history seems to be forgotten. It is said that when women stand near the spring-house they get an uneasy feeling.  I was feeling extremely uncomfortable the day I was taking the pictures, but I accredited that to being on the property, I didn't see anybody else there, yet I felt like I was being watched.  Another guest was taking pictures of the Spring-house and her pictures shows a fog-like mist rising out of the spring. Yet, there was no fog in the area the day she took the picture. This is another story told by Paranormal Investigator Patty Wilson, I find this story fascinating. The local high school teacher was asking for reports of historical sights. So two girls decided to do a historical report on the Historic Royer Mansion.  The girls called the Historical Society to schedule a tour of the haunted mansion. When they arrived they didn't find a car in the area. An elderly lady opened the back door and motioned for them to come in. She was very elderly and dressed in a house dress like women wore in the 1960s. The woman was pleasant and kind and seemed very informative. The only thing that bothered them was that this woman kept talking to someone that wasn't there. The conversation seemed strange and the girls became uneasy and ran from the Royer Mansion without saying goodbye.  When the girls told their parents about the tour, one of the mothers of a girl was upset that her daughter could be so rude. The mother called the Historical Society to apologize.  The woman from the society interrupted the mother when she called and she couldn't apologize enough for not showing up for the tour.  The only thing everybody could figure is that it had to have been Carrie that greeted the girls for the tour. Even though Carrie had been dead for over 50 years." - Quoted from http://www.pennsylvania-mountains-of-attractions.com/royermansion.html<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The Farnsworth Inn is supposedly one of the most haunted inns in America. Countless visitors have witnessed strange things in the old house. One of the most haunted areas is the attic. During the Gettysburg Battle, Confederate sharpshooters used the attic to target Union soldiers. Many believe it was one of these sharpshooters who accidentally killed Jennie Wade. Today those soldiers haunt the attic, and I guess they are very active. Just about every room in the house is haunted though, it gets so scary some visitors can't even stay there through the night!<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> In the modern-day town of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania there is a small jail cell with an apparently long memory. Cell 17 of the Carbon County Jail bears a testament to one man’s innocence in the form of a single handprint on the wall. On “The Day of the Rope” (June 21, 1877) ten men were hanged because they fought for better treatment and better working conditions for their people. One of them, a bold ringleader named Alexander Campbell placed his hand upon the wall and swore it’d stay there as proof of his innocence. His handprint still remains. Sheriffs have tried to remove it over the years, but to no avail. They’ve tried cleaning it off, painting it over and even tearing down the wall and rebuilding a new one. Regardless of their method, the handprint returns as if seeping through from another dimension.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Friendship Hill was Albert Gallatin's wilderness house. Albert Gallatin was a very influential politician, he served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1801 - 1814 for President Thomas Jefferson and President James Madison. He arranged the financing for both the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark expeditions. Friendship Hill is supposedly haunted by Albert Gallatin's first wife, Sophia. They got married in May of 1789, but she died suddenly in October of 1789. She is buried somewhere on the property. Supposedly people who lived in the house after Gallatin unearthed the remains and moved them from a knoll along the Monongahela River to the new grave that is pictured above. However, there is no official evidence of this, so it is just speculation that Sophia's remains are in the grave surrounded by the stone wall. Anyway, today park rangers and visitors claim to hear Sophia walking around the house, especially the upper floors where visitors aren't allowed to go.<br>

During the Civil War, the Confederate Army fought against the Union Army at the location, mainly soldiers from Texas and Georgia. That would explain why many visitors claim to see ghostly apparitions of Confederate soldiers there. While some don't see the soldier's ghosts, they do see strange lights and/or hear gunfire. Many ghosthunters have experienced camera problems in the area as well.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Mount Washington Tavern is one of many taverns that were built along the National Road. These taverns gave weary stagecoach travelers a place to eat and rest, and they were also where the stagecoach operators could change horses. The Mount Washington Tavern was built between 1827-1828 by Judge Nathaniel Ewing. It was named Mount Washington since it was built on the Great Meadows that George Washington once owned. Park rangers have heard unexplainable footsteps and laughing at the tavern after the park has closed.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> This historic New England tavern has had sightings of a man dressed in shabby old - fashioned clothes for many years. Usually it is near the right side of the fireplace in one of the dining rooms, but one little boy spotted the man in an upstairs men's room. One night two employees each ran downstairs to confront an "intruder" they could hear walking around after they had locked up - and found the place completely empty. The current owners were lucky enough to come across a clipping from the 1700's of a man who died there when they housed overnight guests. He died suddenly where he was sleeping - near the fireplace - and was quickly buried in a pauper's grave for fear that he may have died of smallpox or some other communicable disease. His identity remains a mystery.<br>

As early as 1925, a female apparition was seen on the staircase by the woman who lived there. A "lady in black" has been known to fade away in the cupola, and a woman in antebellum style hoop skirts has been seen in the ballroom. The antebellum lady has been speculated to be the spirit of Amasa's daughter in law, the beautiful wife of a Civil War hero. The Doll Room has had reports from visitors of footsteps when no one is around, and the wine cellar has a spirit who likes to touch visitors.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Visitors report the sounds of a baby crying. Reports of a spectral, flaming ship have stemmed from the horrific voyage of the Princess Augusta: in 1738 the ship came from Rotterdam.  Many of the German passengers died of a gastrointestinal ailment en route, then a tremendous blizzard kept them 12 miles from the coast, hung up on a sandy crag on the north tip of Block Island. The captain, for whatever reason, wouldn't let the ailing passengers off of the boat at this point, and several more died before they were allowed off.  The ship was so scarred from the storm that it was cut loose and allowed to crash into the rocks and sink.  Today, locals report a fiery ship, called "the Palatine light", off the north coast in December.<br>

A monument on the grounds commemorates "Pierce's Fight"; the deaths of nine colonial militiamen who were killed by really, reaaally pissed local Native Americans on March 26th, 1676. The nine men were flayed (skinned alive), their heads put on pikes with sticks placed to hold the corners of their mouths in a "grin" to symbolize the smiling, lying white men that the Indians had quickly grown to hate. Screams are reported in the vicinity of the massacre, and some people claim that if you hold your ear to the stone, you can hear the screams as well.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> In this small town of White Bluff there’s a famous hollow where the White Screamer dwells. No one knows exactly what it is or its origin. It’s said to be a white mysty form that wails and cries and screams enough to make any person go insane, thus gaining its title of “The White Screamer”. It has also been noted that if one ventures to the spot where they might’ve seen the White Screamer, the grass will be burned away. Alledgedly, around the 1920’s a young man built his family of a wife and seven children a home and farm down in the hollow, and every single night they’d wake up to the sound of this awful crying and screaming. So, finally, after this young man has had enough, he grabs his shotgun and runs out into the night off to find whatever beast is making this awful noise. He climbs to the top of one of the surrounding hills to see if he can spot it, and then hears the sound of screaming… only it’s the voices of his family and children. By the time he can climb down this hill and get back to his house, he finds his whole family dead.. and pieces of their body thrown around on the ground and the floors of the house. You can still drive down into the hollow and see the foundation of the house and graves of the members.<br>

This time, they unplugged it. A little while later, they saw the bulb glowing again, but the lamp was still unplugged. Suddenly, the bulb exploded into flames.

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The Rotherwood Mansion, off Netherland Road, is said to be haunted by a young woman who died in the river that runs beside the mansion. Her father, a wealthy land owner, frowned on her love with a soldier, and forbade them ever to see each other. One night before going to war, however, the young soldier came to see his lover. The woman’s brother found them, fought the young soldier, and threw him in the river. The soldier was then swept away with the current. Heartbroken, the women, threw herself into the river to find her beau. She drowned trying. Now it is said that she can be seen, walking along the river at night, carrying a lantern, looking for her lost love. She is said to wear a long white dress, that may be a nightgown.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Tragedy hit the Bowman family in 1880, as Bowman's wife and children died in an unknown matter. Perhaps an outbreak of typhoid or some other disease killed his family, or they suffered some sort of accident; (horse buggy, etc.) or attack, as there was a mysterious dark spot (blood?) found at the top of the stairs, which gives sensitive visitors unpleasant feelings. An apparition of an unknown woman, perhaps Mrs. Bowman, has been seen throughout the mansion, going about her business. Perhaps she died before she could complete a long list of chores to do, and she can't let go of this world because she died before she was ready.<br>

After she appeared at the foot of the stairs before them, she turned around and floated up the stairs, and then melting into the air.This friendly, beneign female apparition turned out not to be alone.

<b>Notes/Details:</b> History tells us that the steam engine was invented by Robert Fulton. However, it was actually invented by a man named Samuel Morey. In 1793, he fitted a paddle wheel and steam engine to a small boat and powered up and down the Connecticut River. Legend has it that this was done on a Sunday morning, when the town was at church, to avoid ridicule if he failed. Credit for the first successful steamboat line goes to Robert Fulton and his financier, Chancellor Robert Livingston. This was a cause for contention, as Morey claims that they took some of his ideas. Captain Morey was so angered, that he sunk his boat, the Aunt Sally to the bottom of Lake Morey (named in honor of Samuel Morey) in Fairlee, VT, and on a still, moonlit night, the Aunt Sally rises to the lake's surface and floats without sound or ripple, as the ghost of Captain Morey watches from shore.<br>

And where did they go to a party?" And another guest reported that he"heard the people across the hall from me last night talking and laughing and speaking about how happy they were." In each of these and all instances, it's in reference to the same room, always late at night, and with similar descriptions as to what they heard the other guests saying.

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Built on the foundation of the former sheriff that was responsible for hanging witches during the infamous Salem witch trial's house, many reports of hauntings in the house have been reported. The sheriff used an old English law that allowed him to crush a suspected witch with rocks to make him plead guilty or innocent. The man eventually died, but he did so, he “cursed” the sheriff. The sheriff died 5 years later of unknown causes. Candles have mysteriously been taken out of their holders and melted, trash cans have turned over, it is always cold in the corner of one room, alarms are set off for no reason, one guest has seen an elderly ghost sitting by the fireplace, and a picture has been taken of one of the ghosts.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Like many other business or historical locations in Massachusetts, this inn was once a Masonic lodge. There are several names attached to the unusual events here, most namely Phillip Knight II, the original owner, and Capt. Henry Quiner. The most common occurrences involved the playing of the piano, ringing of unseen bells and the smell of wax or roses. Loud parties are often heard by visitors, only to be informed by the people who work there that there was no party. There have also been several sightings, including a greenish figure sitting in a chair and a dead body that was seen and then disappeared. The effect on several different senses makes this a convincing location.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Dog town is an area near Cape Ann and Gloucester that has an interesting mix of history based on legend and current paranormal activity. Established in 1623 as a shipping town, the women who settled there began to breed dogs to keep them company during the long months their husbands were at sea. The town was built inland to prevent attacks from the Native Americans along the coast, but the choice of settlement also led to isolation for the citizens. They changed their economy from fishing to farming to become more self-sufficient, but the town some began to bleed money and could not sustain itself. The citizens began to rent out the houses to make ends meet which allowed an odd element to enter the town. Eventually the town was abandoned, although some of the odder elements stayed. The town was known to host phantom shadows and was the landing area for many of the witched of the area who were cast out of other areas.<br>

There have been reports of lights flashing even though there is no electricity hooked up in the house for over fifteen years. Police have made several arrests over the years and stake the house out on Halloween and other paranormal hallmarks. The house borders a Civil War cemetery, and people in the area think this might be the cause of the hauntings.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The lighthouse was once tended by John Thomas and hid wife Hannah. When John was called off to service, Hannah took over all of the responsibilities of the lighthouse. She tended to all the duties while watching the distance for her husband to return. He never did and eventually Hannah gave up her job and passed away. Her spirit seems to have stayed on at the lighthouse, but she makes her presence known only to men. People have heard her footsteps or heard an unknown female voice. Others have seen a faint figure they describe as looking sad.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> There are many legends about this area, everything from Paul Revere and a ghostly horse to a pair of older women playing cards in 18th Century clothes. Unless you are there at night, there is no sensation of unusual energy, and the sight itself begs to be haunted, Many people have died there over the years, but there have also been many positive memories that might have left a mark. The spot has also been the scene of several time slips where people have left the hotels across the street, or gone in at night and seen Boston the way it was centuries before.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The country’s oldest abandoned subway is said to be home to the ghosts of some of the victims of a horrible accident more than a hundred years ago. Sixty feet below the Boylston Street stop on the Green Line runs an old subway rail. On March 4, 1897 a gas explosion killed ten people and injured 60 more, including bystanders on the street and the conductor of the car. Their ghosts are said to still haunt those underground passageways.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> There is a spirit there, probably that of an old female teacher who taught the "undesirables" of the time like women and people of different religions. There is also a secret room that most likely was used to hide escaped slaves in the Underground Railroad. The spirit or spirits mostly affect women, which points to the teacher who tried to make a difference in the lives of women. She makes her presence known by moving things, knocking and opening and closing doors, as well as chilling people with cool air as she passes. She is most active when there is immature behavior going on.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The front of the Stage Coach Inn was built approx. 1723 and was used as a Parsonage and then later converted to an Inn. The back part of the Inn was at one time a 17th century Garrison house dating from 1678 and may be one of the few structures to survive the burning of the town during King Phillips War. The area around the back of the Inn is called Gibbet Hill, reportedly, but cannot be proven that it was used in Colonial times as a site to hang Indians, hence the name "Gibbet" Hill which means hanging hill. The basement of the Inn was used as a Speak Easy during Prohibition. And there are reports that a murder of one brother by another took place in the basement. I could not confirm this. The Family of Joseph Hoar owned the Inn for the better part of the 19th century. The three spinster sisters who ran the Inn, Lila, Eve and Charlotte, sold it in 1901 and moved to Lancaster where they had a nephew and they lived out their lives. I was also able to track the "Civil War" soldier story to an individual named Edwin Howe, who hung himself near the Inn in Apr. 1905. Both he and the Hoar sisters are buried in Groton. Is he the source of an urban legend that exists about the Inns "Civil War" soldier? Multiple reports of visitors vacated from Rm 10 in the middle of the night, Investigators shaken awake while sleeping in rooms 10 and 16, Audio Anomaly( Indian war cries both complained of by visitors and experienced by one of the investigators), EVPs, Lights turned off in front of investigators, Feeling of heaviness frequent in parlor next to front lobby.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Multiple EVP's were captured in the client's master bedroom, loft room, loft closet and down stairs computer room. Temperatures in the loft and the closet of the loft ranged from +78°F to +66°F were measured. The changes in temperature took place very quickly and several occurred during times when EVP's were captured. Investigators Jack Kenna and Sarah Campbell both had personal experiences in these areas. While Jack was standing at the top landing area of the stairs to the loft, near the closet, he began feeling cold, had goose bumps all over his body, and was getting waves of chills run up through his body from his feet to his head. He also got a very strong feeling that he should leave the loft area and that he shouldn’t be there. It was at this time that he received an eve response to a statement he made saying that if there was anything there it could speak into the recorder, the response captured was a “No”. During this same time investigator Sarah also began getting a strong headache. Both of these investigators also head breathing and knocking noises within the loft closet and also heard that disembodied voice respond “No” to a question that they asked. Some of this activity they experienced was also captured on their digital recorders. The average EMF readings recorded within the client's home are 0.3 to 0.5 milligauss, although some individual electrical items such as the microwave oven in the kitchen and the clock radio speaker in the master bed room did record very high readings. Complete details of this investigation can be obtained in the SoNE report which is available on their website at http://www.spiritsofnewengland.org/Investigations.html . Some of the evidence from this investigation is also available on the websites Evidence page.<br>

<b>Equipment Reading (if Applicable):</b> Numerous KII hits in response to direct questions from Investigators &amp; client. These hits all occurred in the client&#39;s teenage daughter&#39;s bedroom.<br>
<b>Information Source:</b> Clients and SoNE report to clients<br>
<b>Researcher or Group Reporting:</b> SPIRITS of New England (SoNE)<br>
<b>Notes/Details:</b> Several EVP's were captured through out the home in the master bedroom, basement, living room and teenage daughter's bedroom. One male and one female voice can clearly be heard on some of the EVP's and not  the voices of the investigators or the clients. The EVP's responses were in direct response to questions or seem to be interacting/injecting there own ideas regarding a conversation the investigators were having. One mild cold spot was experienced in the teenage daughter's bedroom by Investigators Ellen and Jack as well as the client’s teenage daughter. This cold spot was not significant enough though to say that is was related to anything paranormal. In contrast, when the team first entered the basement, one area of the basement, the area to the immediate left side of the stairs and just past the hot water tank had a very warm, heavy and stagnant feel to it. This was experienced by all four investigators as well as the client during the initial walk through of the home. Latter during the EMF sweep of the home and during the investigation of the basement it was identified that this warm, heavy and stagnant feeling had gone away. Given the fact that numerous EVP's and other sounds were captured in the basement and given the fact that this feeling was limited to a small area of a somewhat open basement floor plan, it may be concluded with some level of confidence that this warm, heavy and stagnant feeling can be attributed to a possible paranormal source. Extremely high levels of EMF exist throughout the home. These high EMF levels can be a contributing factor to some of the client’s feelings of being uncomfortable (like your being watched), headaches, seeing things, and feeling ill (stomach aches). It is strongly suggested that the family have the wiring in the home looked at by an electrician. A detailed report of this investigation can be obtained from SoNE upon written request to them at spiritsofnewengland.org@gmail.com. Also, some of the evidence from this investigation can be reviewed at their website at http://www.spiritsofnewengland.org/Evidence.html .<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Bay Path Cemetery was investigated due to a possible connection with the case on Tilton Street in Springfield, MA. These two locations are approximately 200 yards apart. It was discovered that the client used to work at the local Municipal Hospital from which many of the people buried in this cemetery had been residents at and died there. Bay Path Cemetery is an old paupers cemetery which was in use from 1873 to 1954. There are over 1000 unmarked graves in this small cemetery. A full investigation of this cemetery has never been done to our knowledge but the SoNE team did capture two good EVP's during their small limited 2 hour investigation of this location during daylight hours. More detailed information of this cemetery and the findings can be found in the SoNE report of the Tilton Street investigation on their website at http://spiritsofnewengland.org/Investigations.html<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Built in 1750, this historic building has a rich past, including once being a boarding house for the elderly and more significantly for being a safe house for the underground railroad. There is a small hidden brick room in the restaurant called "snug harbor" in which the runaway slaves would hide. This room is said to be haunted by a family that is cowering in he corner. Just outside the bathrooms in the lobby , the ghosts of pacing fathers of years past are said to be still seen, as the area was a birthing room many years ago. Sometimes the images are seen in the mirror located there. The third floor loft is home to a malevolent ghost that is feared by staff. Cold spots are reported. The area is now the liquor room for the establishment. In the kitchen the ghost of a former owner appeared to the current manager, apparently on the day he died in New Orleans<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The Ropes Mansion is now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum. It was home to Nathaniel and Abigail Ropes. Nathaniel Ropes was a judge during the witch trials. It is a gorgeous mansion, and the gardens behind the house are just as beautiful. The Ropes Mansion is supposedly haunted by Abigail Ropes. She died in the house when her nightgown caught on fire in the bedroom upstairs. She just walked too close to the fireplace - it wasn't too uncommon for a woman's clothes to catch on fire like this back then. Today some people claim to see her ghostly figure roaming throughout the mansion.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> Construction of the Salem Jail began in 1811. The original building was enlarged in 1884-1885, and it was used as a prison until it closed in 1991. Today it stands abandoned. Over the years many ghost stories have been told about it. Supposedly the prisoners who died there still roam the halls at night. It is rumored to be one of the most haunted places in Salem.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The activity listed here is quoted from the book. Although the books author mentions sightings by individuals and boats, no specific names of witnesses are provided. ."A black phantom dory boat is seen like those used for short distance trawling. It was first spotted in 1880, when a steamer, the Nantucket, tried to effect a rescue. But the boat just disappeared. Sometimes it is surrounded by an eerie phosphorescence, other times the bloodied body of a white man is seen in the bottom of the boat, while a black man stands at the bow. One holiday party from Martha's Vineyard told of detecting the odors of spices mixed with decomposing flesh coming from the phantom boat. Always the shout is heard: "Hello-o-o." "<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> 150-year-old military base also an old Indian burial ground (under soccer field). Many areas are haunted. In mid-May &#39;00, one guard was dozing in his patrol car at night when he heard a knock on the window. He opened his eyes to see 2 men, one on either side of the car, pointing at him &amp; laughing. He could see right thru them. This guard (an ex-marine) never believed in ghosts &amp; taunted the others who did. The other guards wouldn&#39;t go to that area at night &amp; warned him that it was haunted, but he didn&#39;t believe them then.<br>

Then, they saw on the balcony above them, a lady in a flimsy, purple gown , who told them, "Shush!," in an effort to quiet and calm them down. Then she went right through the closed doors of the room behind the balcony. When the Curator, Mrs. C, arrived to let them in, they asked her why the lady on the balcony didn't open up the building? There wasn't any lady on the balcony, and all then realized it was a ghost that had been seen. Mrs. C. realized then that the mansion was haunted. The lady that was seen on the balcony, was believed to be Madam Jumel herself, as she fit the description.<br>

<b>Notes/Details:</b> The Kings Park Psychiatric Center was established in 1885 by Kings County in nearby Suffolk County, prior to the merging of Kings County with Queens County, New York County, Richmond County, and the Bronx County, to form the famous New York City. The official name of the hospital in its first ten years was the "Kings County Asylum," taken from the name of the county that Brooklyn occupied. The hospital was revolutionary at the time in the sense that it was a departure from the asylums of folklore, which were overcrowded places where gross human rights abuses often took place. The asylum, built by Brooklyn to alleviate overcrowding in its own asylums, was a "Farm Colony" asylum, where patients worked in a variety of farm-related activities, such as feeding livestock and growing food, as this was considered to be a form of therapy for the mentally ill at the time.<br>

Mr. Jody Jackson did use equipment such as IR cameras and digitals recorders but Watervliet was not provided any evidence or written report of their findings. The information of the type of activity reported that is provided here was obtained from the Arsenal Museum staff and a document they provided me called the Historical Grounds and Building Tour, which was prepared back in Oct 1999 by the Watervliet Arsenal Historical Society for a Ghost Tour they held at that time. This document is available upon request from Jack Kenna, email: jackny46@gmail.com .<br>
