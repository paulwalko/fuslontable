<b>Incident:</b> Kelly Rees Pitts was shot by Wendy Howard  in the 400 block of Appaloosa Ct. Tehachapi CA and later died at Kern Medical. 
Howard's daughter told 17 News that Pitts was abusive to her and her mother, and that Howard killed him out of self-defense. 
 Court documents say Howard told investigators that on the night of the shooting, the two had been arguing outside her home, and that Pitts ran over her foot on a quad. Howard then shot him. However, investigators wrote that Howard seemed like she was "trying to be dramatic in the story she told" and did not appear genuine. She has since pleaded not guilty to murder.

<b>Incident:</b> California Highway Patrol was dispatched at approximately 0442 hours for a report of a traffic collision on northbound Interstate 5, just north of State Route 43.

The officers contacted the adult male driver who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. 

The subject claimed that he had a firearm, which caused the officers to back away from their approach.  The subject exited the vehicle and began to approach the officers.  The subject refused to comply with the officer’s commands and had a hand concealed as he continued to approach the officers.

An officer-involved shooting ensued.

Medical aid was administered by the officers and responding medical personnel, but the subject was pronounced dead at the scene.<br>
