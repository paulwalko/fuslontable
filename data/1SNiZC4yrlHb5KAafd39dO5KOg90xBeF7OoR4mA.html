<b>Incident Description:</b> Department of Health and Hospitals spokeswoman Lisa Faust said Bureau of Emergency Medical Services personnel discovered the database breach. The unauthorized entry gave the hacker access to an individual’s name and personal information, including Social Security numbers.

“What we don’t know is whether the hacker was able to access any information,” Faust said.

A computer screen displayed the message “You have been hacked,” Faust said. “Since we don’t know one way or the other we sent notices out to 56,000 people that there’s a potential that the information was compromised.”

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> London, England<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> The Barclays hack
The Barclays hackers used their zero-day attack (or hack) to get round the security gate timers the bank's engineers had put in its website software.

It was the hacking equivalent of sitting outside the bank in a Ford Cortina, and checking your watch every time the rent-a-cop does his rounds and the bank manager pops out for his lunch-time massage.

Barclays thought it was prepared for this sort of reconnaissance, said Romain. The bank's security team had reviewed the software behind its website payment system and got everything ship-shape.

They checked how their banking software handled internet transactions. Real people tend to fumble and faff about at their computers. It can take some old timers half a day just to enter their card number.

Yet automated software bots designed by hackers can spit out instructions as fast as the bank computer will receive them. Software like this pretends to be a bank customer, but is far too efficient to be a real person at all.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A mysterious cyber attack apparently struck the computer servers at the pro-tea party group FreedomWorks this morning, just as it launched a major fund-raising drive.

FreedomWorks officials are investigating, but they suspect they were attacked deliberately, perhaps by a political opponent seeking the thwart its fund-raising efforts.

The attack crippled the site at about 9:45 a.m. just when the fund-raising drive was publicized on the radio by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. The group estimates it lost about $80,000 in potential donations as it struggled to bring its site back online.

An “autopsy” showed a highly sophisticated hacker struck at 6:55 a.m., the group said, setting the stage for the eventual meltdown. The server was wiped out, though group officials said no data was lost or stolen.<br>

XSS weaknesses are the result of poor input validation into Web forms and allow attackers to return potentially malicious code to visitors' browsers.

 Ensuring proper validation of all inputs in Web applications, in order to prevent cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities, is actually a requirement of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Spain's copyright society (SGAE) came under attack by hacktivists from Anonymous on Thursday as part of the latest phase of a high-profile campaign against organisations that hassle file-sharers.

A distributed denial of service attack, officially launched at midnight (Central European Time) on 7 October , crashed the organisation's website on Wednesday even before it even officially began. The assault is a repeat of tactics previously used against the websites of Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America  (MPAA) and UK law firm ACS:Law, among others.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> The voting application was written on the Ruby on Rails framework and ran on top of the Apache web server and the MySQL database. The scientists were able to hijack the system after they discovered that they could upload ballots with almost any string they wanted. By inserting Unix commands into the file names, they were able to take “almost total control of the server software, including the ability to change votes and reveal voters' secret ballots,” Halderman said.

A file named “ballot.$(sleep 10)pdf,” for instance, caused the server to pause for 10 seconds. They used similar techniques to install a backdoor on the system that allowed them almost unfettered system access.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against anti-piracy websites have gone on for a week now, with the lawyers behind the "US Copyright Group" being the latest target. And the anonymous Internet users behind "Operation Payback" aren't done acting out; in an interview yesterday with the security experts at Panda Labs, one of the organizers said that Anonymous' attacks will continue "until we stop being angry." Judging from the list of things that make him (?) angry, this could take a while.

The law firm of Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver was one of the newest targets of the attacks, organized a week ago to take down antipiracy organization around the world. Already hit: the RIAA (US), BPI (UK), MPAA (US), AFACT (Australia), BREIN (Netherlands), Aiplex (India), and Websheriff (UK). One of the smaller sites actually yielded the biggest bounty; the UK "P2P settlement letter factory" ACS Law gave up several hundred megabytes of private e-mails after being taken offline by the attack.<br>

To win this honor you have to check in to a location more than anyone else, and to do that you actually have to go there, since Foursquare won't let you check in remotely. But last night Techcrunch editor Michael Arrington punked Foursquare's API and made himself mayor of Facebook and Twitter headquarters, all without ever leaving his office.

"A mischievous hacker friend of mine stepped in with a small script that he wrote that will check me in to any venue at all via the Foursquare API," Arrington wrote in a post on TechCrunch. "That means I don't have to spend time finding friends already where I want to be, and since we're using the API we can easily fake out the "you're not actually there" problem."<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Attackers have begun exploiting a recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft web-development applications that opens password files and other sensitive data to interception and tampering.  The vulnerability in the way ASP.Net apps encrypt data was disclosed last week at the Ekoparty Conference in Argentina. Microsoft on Friday issued a temporary fix for the so-called “cryptographic padding attack,” which allows attackers to decrypt protected files by sending vulnerable systems large numbers of corrupted requests.  Now, Microsoft security pros say they are seeing “limited attacks” in the wild and warned that they can be used to read and tamper with a system's most sensitive configuration files.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Facebook gave little detail about the cause of the outage except to say that it was the result of a misconfiguration in one of its databases, which prompted a flood of traffic from an automated system trying to fix the error.

"We made a change to a persistent copy of a configuration value that was interpreted as invalid," explained Robert Johnson in Facebook's blog post about the incident. "This meant that every single client saw the invalid value and attempted to fix it. Because the fix involves making a query to a cluster of databases, that cluster was quickly overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of queries per second."

The feedback loop created so much traffic that Facebook was forced to turn off the database cluster, which meant turning off the Web site.

"Once the databases had recovered and the root cause had been fixed, we slowly allowed more people back onto the site," Johnson said. He added that "for now we've turned off the system that attempts to correct configuration values."<br>

Bom Sabado means “Good Saturday” in Portuguese, the native language of Brazil where the worm is thought to have originated. Orkut is the most popular social site in Brazil, India and several other countries.

The worm replicates itself across accounts and randomly sends “Bom Sabado” messages to friend’s scrapbooks — Orkut’s version of Facebook’s wall. Google support recently announced that the worm had been contained and they are in the process of cleaning infected accounts. However, the company recommends vigilance when accessing accounts — users should be especially wary about clicking suspicious links.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Another malicious worm hit Twitter over the weekend, days after the micro-blogging site reached near-meltdown from a technically similar attack.

This time around the danger came from clicking links contained in micro-blogging messages beginning "WTF [URL]". Last week's more serious onMouseOver problem struck when users moved their mouse cursor over an infected tweet. These messages contained hidden JavaScript code that exploited a cross-site scripting problem - in the case of the WTF worm a CSRF (cross-site request forgery) technique is in play.

The miscreants behind the latest assault set up an attack page that exploited a CSRF vulnerability in Twitter so that victims who clicked on a link posted a crude message about their supposed fondness for sex with goats, as explained in a blog post by Sophos here.<br>

Computer security researchers have said that an unprecedented mass cyber protest was triggered by efforts by film and music trade groups to close online piracy haunts.
Members of 4chan online forum that promotes users remaining anonymous organized distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on websites for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), according to the security firm PandaLabs.
DDoS attacks are efforts to overload websites with so many simultaneous requests that computer servers can't handle the load and freeze or crash.
Attacks on RIAA caused a dozens of interruptions in service, taking down the group's website for a total of one hour and 37 minutes, according to PandaLabs.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> There is one movie every Polish person knows. It's a cult comedy from the 80s called "Miś" - meaning "Teddy Bear". Now, thanks to a hacker going by a name "Porkythepig", everyone can see it - but not on YouTube where you would expect it, but on the USA military Defence Logistics Agency website. 

If you go the site and just type "porkythepig", a fragment of a movie begins to play. It's in Polish, of course - for those not fluent in Polish the man with a guitar sings: "I'm a Happy Romek..." * It's funny but the story is much more serious.
On Seclists.org you can find a post by porkythepig about the potential vulnerability that exists on many sites, including military and government. 
But apparently since March, when the details of the insecurity were published on seclists.org, nobody did anything to patch the vulnerability so porkythepig decided to prove his observations the hard way. Polish language source is here - but the vulnerability still works at time of publishing so try it yourself.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A vulnerability in a component of the OpenX advertising platform has been exploited by hackers to tamper with ad serving on multiple websites including The Pirate Bay, eSarcasm and AfterDawn.

The affected component, called Open Flash Chart 2, is developed by a third party, but has been included by default in OpenX since last December.

The module allows visitor statistics to be displayed as graphic charts and the vulnerability is located in the ofc_upload_image.php script, which fails to properly validate uploaded files or the users uploading them.

According to Heise Media, the flaw was originally discovered a year ago by another open source project, which uses the same component, but it escaped the OpenX developers when deciding to integrate it.

As a result, hackers can leverage the bug to upload executable scripts and gain complete control of the servers.<br>

Just clicking on the link to one of the applications that were taking advantage of the bug would allow the auto-posting to happen, Facebook said. The apps, which appeared to be sending people to a survey Web site, were disabled on Monday, the company said.
"Earlier this week, we discovered a bug that made it possible for an application to bypass our normal CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protections through a complicated series of steps. We quickly worked to resolve the issue and fixed it within hours of discovering it," Facebook said in a statement. "For a short period of time before it was fixed, several applications that violated our policies were able to post content to people's profiles if those people first clicked on a link to the application."<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> As reported by The Register IT news portal, a number of smaller websites have been hacked using an SQL injection attack method that attempts to obfuscate links to malware infected pages. The hack apparently also affected two Apple websites that are used to promote its iTunes podcasts.

Other than the Apple sites, the news service says that at least 538 000 “mom-and-pop” websites have been victimized by the hack, in addition to 500 000 more that appear quite similar but lead to different domains. 

The attack takes advantage of web-based application vulnerabilities, which often do not differentiate between legitimate search queries and intentional attacks via malicious code. 

The Register reported that the malware-infected links have been removed from the Apple pages since Google last indexed its search page earlier this month. 

The attack underlines the need for companies to go the extra mile and secure external web-facing applications said Rob Horton, the operational director of security testing consultant NCC Group.<br>

Foolish, foolish Bieber has started a competition for countries to vote for him to come and tour them. Called the Justin Bieber My World Tour Contest, it has now been thoroughly highjacked by Anonymous – at the time of writing, North Korea is in second place by only a few thousand votes. Unless the current leader Israel can get its act together, it should be overtaken by lunchtime.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Today, members of the Internet communities 4chan and other enterprising computer whizzes hacked YouTube using a vulnerability in the site’s comment system. While the hack was used on a variety of videos, striking music videos featuring teen pop idol Justin Bieber was the most popular activity.

Twitter lit up with complaints about the problem, Google support got some concerned posts on its forum, and we received tips in our inbox. The event caused quite a Sunday-morning stir.

The bug allowed users to inject HTML (the code that most websites are built with) that could be executed on the site, whereas HTML within comments is supposed to be restricted. The hackers did everything from force pop-up messages to appear over the site declaring that it had been hacked to redirecting Bieber video pages to sites hosting pornography and malware.<br>

On Thursday, the Legislature's information technology officials shut down the website's bill status function, which allows users to follow legislation such as roll calls, committee votes, amendments and fiscal notes.

The manipulated code inserted the addresses of extraneous websites that could have exposed users' computers to harm if they clicked on the links, said Scott Clark, director of information technology for the Legislature.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A total of $465,000 was recently stolen from California-based Village View Escrow via 26 consecutive wire transfers.

"Owner Michelle Marisco said her financial institution at the time -- Professional Business Bank of Pasadena, Calif. -- normally notified her by e-mail each time a new wire was sent out of the company’s escrow account," writes Krebs on Security's Brian Krebs. "But the attackers apparently disabled that feature before initiating the fraudulent wires."

"Marisco said that a few days before the theft, she opened an e-mail informing her that a UPS package she had been sent was lost, and urging her to open the attached invoice," Krebs writes. "Nothing happened when she opened the attached file, so she forwarded it on to her assistant who also tried to view it. The invoice was in fact a Trojan horse program that let the thieves break in and set up shop and plant a password-stealing virus on Marisco’s computer, and on the PC belonging to her assistant -- the second person needed to approve transfers."<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Australian broadband news website Whirlpool.net.au was the target of several Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks this morning. The hosting provider moved quickly to mitigate, but attackers evaded the restrictions, causing an aggregated downtime of around ten hours.

Whirlpool.net.au is one of the most trafficked Australian websites, housing a community of over 350,000 registered users. It was started twelve years ago as a place to discuss Internet broadband services in the country, but has since evolved into a full-blown news website covering the telecommunications industry.

"Bulletproof received monitoring alerts of packet loss at 12:45 am. We identified it as a classic denial-of-service attack being targeted at Whirlpool. We immediately blocked Whirlpool IP addresses to observe it better and then we were able to track down that it was originating from Denmark and the United States," Lorenzo Modesto, chief operating officer at Bulletproof Networks, the company hosting Whirlpool, commented for ZDNet Australia.<br>

 In the largest single attack, a hacker gained administrative access to the Direct Admin server management system used by a hosting provider, who Computerworld Australia will not name, and suspended 159 accounts rendering their web sites inaccessible to the public.

The suspension notification page was then defaced with the hackers’ moniker and religious propaganda.

The hack was launched through a flaw created after an automatic patch of the admin system failed to complete.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Sorry for the outage yesterday between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Virginia Right! was under attack with a Distributed Denial of Service. Part of the problem in resolving the issue is the fact that Virginia Right! is on a shared hosting server with many hosts using the same IP address. The first thing that has to be determined is which domain is under attack. They do this by temporarily assigning a static IP address to each site hosted on the server (as opposed to all of us sharing the same address). When they were done, everyone came back up except – Virginia Right!. So the attacks were specifically directed at us!<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Police arrested 33 hackers who used a “distribution of denial of service” program to cheat online poker players out of 55 million won ($45,265) from last November through May. 

The hackers, led by 30-year-old Yu and 29-year-old Kim, were booked without detention on charges of gaining illegal profits.

The Cyber Terror Response Center in Gyeonggi said the gang used a DDOS attack to infect 11,000 computers at 700 PC rooms across the country.

Police said Yu bought the “Netbot Attacker” program from a Chinese hacker last November, then sold copies online to Kim and others. The gang broke into the administrative systems of the PC rooms and installed the virus in their computers to allow them to see the hands of poker opponents.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Earlier this month, we reported on a new variant of Asprox malware which was being spammed out by the Pushdo botnet. At that time, the Asprox executables we analyzed were purely sending spam. However, a few days after our post, we noticed reports of mass infections of IIS/ASP websites. The nature of these attacks reminded us of SQL injection attacks back in 2008 where Asprox was clearly involved. We suspected that the re-emergence of Asprox and these new mass website infections were not merely a coincidence. Well, this week our suspicions were confirmed when we came across another version of Asprox which started to launch both spam and SQL injection attacks.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Access to the internet in Turkey is becoming increasingly ragged, as growing state censorship collides with retaliation by anti-censorship hackers, leading to difficulties both in viewing sites and applying key online functions.
Since early this morning the websites of the Ministry of Transportation, the Information and Communication Technologies Authority and the Telecommunications Communication Presidency have been inaccessible. These three state bodies are responsible for internet censorship and have been the principal actors behind attempts to block access to YouTube and Google-related services in Turkey.

A number of theories abound, with favourites the state authorities’ websites have either been hacked or subject to a serious denial of service attack by hackers unhappy at the censorship.

Writing for the CyberLaw UK Blog, Dr Yaman Akdeniz, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Law, Istanbul Bilgi University, now writes that it has been confirmed as a denial of service attack coordinated by a group of hackers to protest against internet censorship in Turkey, and that the attack lasted 10 hours.<br>

Mizhen, who previously settled a separate spam lawsuit brought by Microsoft, allegedly got around the company's anti-spam system by creating millions of new email accounts and then arranging for those accounts to classify his messages as "not spam," according to the lawsuit.
"Defendants developed and executed an elaborate scheme to circumvent Microsoft's Hotmail spam filters to disseminate a large quantity of spam email advertisements to Microsoft's Hotmail users," the company alleges in its complaint, filed last week in federal district court in Seattle.

The complaint details how Mizhen and his affiliates allegedly manipulated the statistics that Microsoft's anti-spam system relies on by creating millions of new email accounts and then moving up to 200,000 of their own messages a day from "junk" files into inboxes.<br>

"The real war today is online. I spent an entire week exploring the site, a few hours each night, until I succeeded," he said.
 
The hacker added that he was surprised to learn that IHH received some 9,000 euros in donations every hour via the website. The group is planning to send a second flotilla to Gaza next month.<br>

The attacks are being carried out with the help of a top-to-bottom revision of BlackEnergy, a popular hack-by-numbers toolkit that until recently was used primarily to launch DDoS, or distributed denial-of-service, attacks. Eastern European criminal gangs are using the expanded capabilities of BlackEnergy 2 to siphon funds out of electronic bank accounts and then assault the financial institutions with more data than they can handle, said Joe Stewart, a researcher with security firm SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> If you follow our blog, you probably noticed that these last few months have been specially hard for hosting companies. Lots of them got hacked, bringing down thousands of sites with them. Now we are hearing reports of a mass hack of WordPress blogs hosted on Rackspace.

What is going on?

The attackers were able to get access to Rackspace databases and infect the sites through there. They created a new admin user on many Worpress sites, giving them full access to the WordPress admin panel.

With that access they were able to inject malware, and as we saw before they used that to inject SEO spam to the sites.

One of the posts in that thread also suggests that the attack vector is a vulnerable version (2.11.3) of phpMyAdmin used by RackSpace Cloud. If this is true, hackers must have targeted an XSRF attack at one of RackSpace admins with mySql root permissions to gain access to the whole database (probably created one more admin user). At this point, RackSpace has upgraded their phpMyAdmin nodes. Hope, they also found any changes in the database done by those hackers.<br>

script src= http://kdjkfjskdfjlskdjf.com/kp.php
Which looks very similar to the attacks from the last few weeks, but this time using kp.php instead of js.php. Also, many sites that were not infected during the previous batch got hacked now.<br>

<b>WHID ID:</b> 2010-120<br>

<b>Attack Method:</b> Remote File Inclusion (RFI)<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> You would expect that a security-related web site would be secure, no? What about an official web site from a Government? Should that be safe? What about a government web site about security? Shouldn’t that be ultra super secure? (yes, I am joking  )

That’s not always the case… At Sucuri Security we have two main goals: Monitor your visible Internet presence (via DNS, site content changes, whois, blacklisting status, etc), and to also monitor what is not visible (or easily accessible). So we run multiple honey pots, we monitor IRC chats used by botnets and attackers, multiple forums, etc. All with the goal to protect our clients and notify them if we see any issue in the “underground”.

With this work, we get to see a lot of sites being exploited and attacked. Most of them are small sites, but sometimes we see big companies, .govs and many .edus in there.

One of those government web sites are from Colombia. And they are not a normal .gov site, they are about security and about cyber crimes.

They have two web sites that are currently hacked: http://www.delitosinformaticos.gov.co (related to solving cyber crimes) and 
http://www.frentesdeseguridad.gov.co (related to security in general). We tried to contact them and got no replies. We would wait a little more to publish it, but since clem1 mentioned them on our post about Georgia government sites hacked, I think it is time to use full-disclosure to get them fixed.<br>

You know, you would think that after all the attacks that Georgia suffered in 2008 they would be more careful about the security of their sites.

Well, not really. Even after I sent a bunch of emails to all their addresses that I could find and requested on twitter for contacts in the .ge government, nobody replied and they are still hacked, spreading malware and attacking other systems.

It doesn’t look like it is being caused by the Russians or anything like that. And the attackers this time didn’t defaced their web page. They just added some malware and scripts to attack others.

How do I know? We run multiple honeypots to detect web-based attacks and malware. And guess who started attacking us?<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A Turkish hacker has managed to hijack msn.co.il and hotmail.co.il, two domains belonging to Microsoft, and use them to post a pro-Palestinian message. The name servers and administrative email address for the domains have been changed.

Users who accessed hotmail.co.il and msn.co.il earlier today were greeted by a page displaying the image of a child wearing the Palestinian flag as a cape and a message reading, "Free Palestine. Hi to greatest [expletive] of the world (i mean all the Jews). u think one day u will own all the world eh? Lol that makes me laugh. that makes all the world laugh. u are just insects. make muslims angrier and just sit and watch what will happen to you." The attacker signs the messsage as TurkGuvenligi Tayfa ("from Turkey with love") and sends greetings to Pakbugs, a notorious group of hackers and defacers.

It appears that the two Microsoft domains, which normally redirect users to login.live.com and il.msn.com, respectively, had their name server information altered. The new ns1.dollar2host.com and ns2.dollar2host.com name servers, which belong to a private Web hosting company, replaced the usual ns1.msft.net and ns2.msft.net that Microsoft used for its domains.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A security flaw in AT&amp;T&#39;s network exposed the e-mail addresses of more than 100,000 owners of Apple&#39;s 3G iPad, according to a report published by Gawker today.

Calling it the &quot;most exclusive e-mail list on the planet,&quot; Gawker said the list of exposed owners included New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and other powerful figures in finance, media and politics.

The security hole was uncovered by Goatse Security, a group known among security experts as hackers who enjoy pulling Web pranks, Gawker reported. Still, the group previously has uncovered flaws in browsers Firefox and Safari, Gawker said.

When contacted by ABCNews.com, a man who asked to be named as a Goatse employee confirmed Gawker&#39;s report.

&quot;It&#39;s absolutely real,&quot; he said, adding that the group gave the Gawker reporter their data set and he was able to verify the information.

The employee said someone in his organization learned that when given an iPad owners&#39; unique identification number, a program on AT&amp;T&#39;s website would return the e-mail address connected to that account.

Once the hole was uncovered, he said, the group was able to write a script that would automatically predict ID numbers and return the associated e-mail addresses.

In about six hours, he said, the group was able to scrape information for about 114,000 iPad 3G owners, but he did not say how many iPad owners could have been affected in total.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> More than 100,000 webpages, some belonging to newspapers, police departments, and other large organizations, have been hit by an attack over the past few days that redirected visitors to a website that attempted to install malware on their machines.

The mass compromise appears to have affected sites running a banner-ads module on top of Microsoft's Internet Information Services using ASP.net, said David Dede, head of malware research at Sucuri, a website monitoring firm.  The sites were infected using SQL injection exploits, which allow attackers to tamper with a server's database by typing commands into search boxes and other user-input fields. The hackers used the exploit to plant iframes in the compromised sites that redirected visitors to robint.us. Malicious javascript on that site attempted to infect end users with malware dubbed Mal/Behav-290 according to anti-virus firm Sophos.<br>

Police Commissioner A.K. Khan told reporters that seven people, among them five passport agents, were arrested and a search was on for two other agents involved in the racket.

The passport office releases online slots for confirmed dates of appointments to the applicants for obtaining passports under 'Tatkal' scheme through its website www.passport.gov.in.

Every day these slots were visible to the users only for a few minutes till the slots released by the passport authorities were exhausted.

The accused hacked the website, blocked the online slots and were selling the same to the applicants for huge sums, police said.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Incident-prone social network monolith Facebook has plugged yet another security leak, this time involving the indexing by search engines of email addresses not listed on Facebook.  Thousands of email addresses submitted using Facebook's "Find a friend" feature that were not tied to a Facebook account wound up getting indexed by Google, according to Blogger Cory Watilo, who was among those affected.


"One obvious problem is that spammers can easily scrape this data and add easily legitimate address to their lists, many of whom might not give their addresses to Facebook for a reason," Watilo writes.  The issue sparked a lively discussion thread on Hacker News.  Facebook changed its robot.txt file to prevent the search engine from indexing the relevant "opt out of emails from Facebook" page so that email address data can no longer be harvested by spammers or other miscreants.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> With a weak network security, the website http:// www.egovamc.com. has several chinks in its armour and is a ready invitation for hackers. The issue has been brought to notice of senior AMC officials and only recently they effected a few cosmetic security patch-ups for their website. 

“We have reported the bugs in the website and problems with database management system and coding. We had earlier told the systems department of the AMC about a system that can be exploited with username and password as simple ‘0’. The vulnerability has been fixed by now but there are bigger challenges,” said Sunny Vaghela, a city-based cyber crime expert. 

He said that if the website is vulnerable , it means that the hacker can get access to the control panel of the site, look into the contents such as tendering details, property tax details , building plans and allocation of funds, access to which is restricted to only senior-level civic officials.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Dear users, yesterday we began a poll about the controversial immigration bill SB 1070 asking users what was their sentiment on the bill. It spread virally and was shared on facebook over 500 times and viewed over 10,000 times.

Unfortunately all the of attention has made it the target of some unscrupulous individuals. Around 3:00pm Tuesday afternoon we noticed that an individual was voting in the poll once every 10 seconds, and did this activity for nearly 2 hours.

Upon checking the logs we realized there were multiple users engaging in this sort of behavior from multiple vectors forcing us to remove the poll entirely. In terms of a long term solution, it seems inevitable that we will adopt a system that requires a KVOA.com user account in order to vote in a poll, but that modification cannot be patched in on the fly and would require a few days work.<br>

They are similar to the one we reported earlier affecting lean.mit.edu, but this time they seem focused only on Wordpress web sites

Attack method

All the sites infected are using the latest Wordpress version and had a PHP script injected inside their wp-includes directory. The script name is random and it does two things:

1-For a search engine, it shows a bunch of keywords (cialis, viagra, movie downloads, etc)
2-For a normal user coming from Google, they are redirected to a web site with malware or to another site for more spam.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Websense Security Labs™ ThreatSeeker™ Network has discovered that the speed testing site of chinaz.com has been compromised.

This payload contains two parts: ap.js, and the obfuscation code in the script tag. When combined, we get the entire exploit code. After analyzing this, we noticed that it is used to target the IE vulnerability (MS10-018), which downloads an executable file named dn.exe. This has a good detection rate by most  AV vendors; however dn.exe will download and execute remote files and send local information to a remote server.  The process disguises itself as an AV component while at the same time suspending the AV software. At present, a bug in the malicious code fails to get the MAC address correctly and as of this alert the site is still infected.<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Web 2.0<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> Up to 125million people worldwide have accounts set up on the site.
But computer security experts say hackers are easily hijacking accounts by pretending they are a customer who has forgotten their password.
As with many websites, iTunes tells users to select a socalled 'security question' from a list of options when they first set up their account.
These are fairly basic and include 'what is your mother's maiden name?' and 'where did you spend your honeymoon?'.
Customers who have forgotten their passwords are prompted with the question they first selected when they set up their profile - as long as they give the correct answer, they can access the account.
Security analysts claim this is leaving the website wide open to fraud.
Hackers simply pretend they are a customer who has forgotten their password and can easily work out the answer to the personal question using information that users have posted on social-networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Microsoft this week filed two lawsuits in federal court in Seattle against alleged perpetrators of a new, technologically advanced form of online advertising click fraud being dubbed "click laundering."

According to Microsoft, click fraud is an online advertising scam that occurs when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user and clicks on an online ad for the purpose of generating a fraudulent “charge-per-click,” without having any interest in the ad.

Click laundering, meanwhile, is a more advanced form of click fraud designed to outwit fraud detection systems by hiding the origin of fake clicks.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Facebook engineers are finishing a patch for a critical vulnerability that exposed user birthdays and other sensitive data even when they were designated as private, a security researcher said Wednesday.

At time of writing, much of the CSRF (cross-site request forgery) bug appeared to have been patched, Keith said. However, as noted earlier by IDG News, attackers still could exploit the flaw to control a user's "like" functions, which are used to endorse ads and other types of content.

The flaw involved a piece of code Facebook engineers dubbed "post_form_id," which is used to ensure that commands can be issued only by browsers that have previously logged into the website. Keith discovered a simple way to bypass the security token: by omitting it altogether, Facebook servers no longer attempted to validate browsers.<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> A huge attack by a rogue Facebook application last weekend infected users' PCs with popup-spewing adware, a security researcher said Monday.

On Saturday, AVG Technologies received more than 300,000 reports of the malicious Facebook app, said Roger Thompson, AVG's chief research officer. AVG came up with its tally by counting the number of reports from its LinkScanner software, a free browser add-on that detects potentially poisoned pages.

"It was stunning, really, the number," said Thompson in an interview via instant message late Monday. "And stunning that it was not viral or wormy [but that] Facebook did it all by itself."

The volume of reports on Saturday's rogue Facebook software was highest during the nine-hour period between midnight and 9 a.m. Eastern, with spikes of approximately 40,000 per hour coming at 7 a.m. and noon. For the day, AVG received more than 300,000 reports, triple that of AVG's second-most-reported piece of spyware.

According to Thompson, Facebook eradicated the rogue application about 15 hours after the attack started. Facebook's only acknowledgment of the attack came on its security page, where a "Tip of the Week" Monday morning read: "Don't click on suspicious-looking links, even if they've been sent or posted by friends."<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> An attacker has discovered a serious flaw in a website set up to encourage the use of smart cards for public transportation in the Netherlands, resulting in the leakage of personal information of more than 168,000 travelers.

The website offered a coupon for a free trip using the OV smart card system and was set up to promote the new system which is being slowly rolled out throughout the region. According to Webwerld, a tech publication based in the Netherlands, the names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals who signed up were publicly available as a result of the flaw.

Information about the flaw was exposed by an anonymous hacker who gave the magazine a video demonstrating the error using a SQL injection attack. The hacker told the magazine that he made the flaw publicly available because there is no excuse for simple website mistakes. The website has since been taken offline.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A Facebook message sent out on Saturday from the account of company board member Jim Breyer to over 2,300 "friends" turns out to have been too good to be true.
The message, an invitation to an event at which attendees would be given a "Facebook phone number," was a phishing attack, designed to capture information from recipients.

The incident underscores the risk of supplying Facebook with data that might be better kept private.

Facebook's appeal to cybercriminals arises from the high level of trust that users extend to Facebook messages, which are generally presumed to come from friends.

Compromising someone's Facebook account also provides immediate access to a pool of new potential victims: the friends of the person whose account has been hacked.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Websense® Security Labs™ ThreatSeeker™ Network has discovered that the popular Web site, phpnuke.org, has been compromised.
 
PHP-Nuke is a popular Web content management system (CMS), based on PHP and a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, or Adabas. Earlier versions were open source and free software protected by GNU Public License, but since then it has become commercial software. As it is still very popular in the Internet community, it is not surprising that it has become a target of blackhat attacks.

<b>Incident Description:</b> Facebook has again come under fire for not doing enough to protect personal information after a security flaw allowed users to eavesdrop on private chat sessions.

The flaw also allowed Facebook members to view other people's pending friend requests.

The social networking site, which has more than 400 million active users, was forced to suspend the live chat function until engineers were able to fix the problem.

The flaw was in the Facebook feature that allows users to view their own privacy settings and could be easily exploited to view others' private information, according to TechCrunch blogger Steve O'Hear, who alerted the social networking site.<br>

The Romanian hackers left a message inviting Italian journalists to avoid confusions between Romanians and gypsies. 

The same group attacked in the last month the sites of the Daily Telegraph and Le Monde. However, unlike the British and French media, the Italian mass media did not mention the attack. Our HotNews.ro corresponded to Italy interviewed Italin Matteo Cavallini, responsible for IT security in the Commerce Ministry.

<b>Incident Description:</b> As if the record industry hasn't tasted enough bitter irony lately, a bunch of album leaks over the weekend apparently came from a service used by music labels to share files with radio stations, media, and other trusted insiders.

According to a post on AbsolutePunk, somebody signed up for an account with Play MPE under false pretenses, claiming to be an Australian music critic. Then this person--apparently a teenage boy--figured out how to access music he wasn't entitled to, including upcoming releases by The Black Keys, Macy Gray, Hole, The Gaslight Anthem, and many other artists.

The AbsolutePunk story referred to this kid as a hacker, but looking at his self-described exploits, that term might be a little too strong. It's not as if he did any sophisticated DRM cracking. Rather, he noticed that that the URL in the Web-based download file had the characters "songid=" followed by a bunch of numbers. By changing the numbers, he was apparently able to to get other song downloads that he wasn't supposed to see.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Part of the Daily Telegraph's website has been hacked, apparently by people in Romania who were aggrieved at its identification of "gypsies" and "Romanians".

Its "Short Breaks" and Wine And Dine sections were both hacked, with the Short Breaks site still up at 12.55pm today, with a picture of a Romanian flag claiming to be for the "Romanian National Security", some comments in Romanian and the remark in English at the bottom that "Guess what, gypsies aren't romanians, morons." It also links to a Russian site which plays an MP3 called The Lonely Shepherd.

Sunbelt Software, which first noticed the hack, said that it had alerted the Telegraph when it noticed the hack.

The method used to hack into the site is not known.<br>

Tinyurl is a URL redirection and shortening tool. This specific URL redirected back to the Apache instance of JIRA, at a special URL containing a cross site scripting (XSS) attack. The attack was crafted to steal the session cookie from the user logged-in to JIRA. When this issue was opened against the Infrastructure team, several of our administators clicked on the link.

<b>Incident Description:</b> The 9.6 million players of the Facebook game FarmTown are being warned about fake security warnings popping up that are designed to mislead people into paying for antivirus protection they don't need.
"We are aware and have reported to the developers that many of our players have encountered the malware/spyware while on the FarmTown Site," the moderator of a user forum for FarmTown maker SlashKey warned over the weekend. "We believe at this time that it is harmless to your computer and a result of one or more of the ads on the site, but you should NOT follow any links to any software claiming to 'clean your system.'"
Sophos' Graham Cluley said it appeared that third-party advertising displayed underneath the FarmTown playing window is to blame.
"In all likelihood, hackers have managed to poison some of the adverts that are being served to FarmTown by the outside advert provider," Cluley wrote on his blog.<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Blogs<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> A large number of bloggers using Wordpress are reporting that their sites recently were hacked and are redirecting visitors to a page that tries to install malicious software.

According to multiple postings on the Wordpress user forum and other blogs, the attack doesn’t modify or create files, but rather appears to inject a Web address — “networkads.net/grep” — directly into the target site’s database, so that any attempts to access the hacked site redirects the visitor to networkads.net. Worse yet, because of the way the attack is carried out, victim site owners are at least temporarily locked out of accessing their blogs from the Wordpress interface.

It’s not clear yet whether the point of compromise is a Wordpress vulnerability (users of the latest, patched version appear to be most affected), a malicious Wordpress plugin, or if a common service provider may be the culprit. However, nearly every site owner affected so far reports that Network Solutions is their current Web hosting provider.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A rash of home foreclosures and abandoned dwellings had already taken its toll on the tax revenue for the Village of Summit, a town of 10,000 just outside Chicago. Then, in March, computer crooks broke into the town’s online bank account, making off with nearly $100,000.  According to Rivera, the theft took place Mar. 11, when her assistant went to log in to the town’s account at Bridgeview Bank. When the assistant submitted the credentials to the bank’s site, she was redirected to a page telling her that the bank’s site was experiencing technical difficulties. What she couldn’t have known was that the thieves were stalling her so that they could use the credentials she’d supplied to create their own interactive session with the town’s bank account.<br>

<b>Attack Method:</b> Redirection<br>

<b>Outcome:</b> Link Spam<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Media<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> SPAMMERs use an Open Redirection vuln in a CNN ad site.  The clever touch was providing a link that exploits redirect functionality supported by CNN’s ad servers.  The link is structured as follows:
http://ads.cnn.com/event.ng/Type=click&amp;Redirect=http:/bit.ly/cP–XW
Clicking on the link sends a request to CNN which instructs the browser to send a second request to the redirect URL – in this case the shortened http:/bit.ly/cP—XW.  The host site would not be aware of the misuse – the spammer is simply abusing legitimate ad-serving functionality.
This technique provides several advantages to the spammer:
1)      The URL from cnn.com might give the impression that there was a genuine CNN-worthy story to be found
2)      The reputable site name would allay fears of anything malicious lurking at the end of the click.
3)      Most URL filtering solutions would not block the initial request to cnn.com (although reputable solutions would have been updated in real time about the follow on link which would be blocked)<br>

"We do not know who is behind the attacks or what their motivation is," the club's board said in an emailed statement explaining it had decided to shut down temporarily the site after two days of "persistent" attacks.
The club has traced the online assault to IP addresses in both China and the U.S., but added that these machines could have been taken over by hackers in other locations.
The hacking was the latest of several recent incidents that have brought to light the Internet vulnerabilities of people or groups whose work may raise hackles in China.<br>

It might be that Facebook's recently proposed changes to its privacy settings could be to blame for the hiccup. PC World writer Paul Suarez reported that "One of those changes [to Facebook's Privacy Policy and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities] would make it possible for Facebook to send your name, photo, friend list, and any public information about you and your friends to preapproved third-party Web sites." A slight tweak to broadcasting profile information could have resulted in this embarrassing flub.<br>

The incidents recall cyber attacks in China that Google in January said had struck it and other unidentified firms in an apparent bid to hack into the email accounts of Chinese human rights activists.

"These infected machines have been used both to spy on their owners as well as participate in distributed denial of service attacks against blogs containing messages of political dissent," said Neel Mehta of Google's security team in the firm's Online Security Blog.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> lectronics retailer Small Dog Electronics has suffered from a systems breach that left 3000 customers' credit card details compromised.

The data theft, which left the credit card details exposed from late December to almost the end of January, used a security hole in the in-house web application that had been developed to manage Smalldog's ecommerce system.

Don Mayer, CEO of Small Dog Electronics, explained that the company is PCI compliant, and that it had been subjected to a penetration test by a third party, which he would not name. The flaw in the code has now been rectified, and Small Dog is investigating the issue with the pen tester, added Mayer, who did not know what language the ecommerce system had been written in.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A mentally ill woman exploited a loophole in D.C. tax office online systems to gain unauthorized access to taxpayer accounts, establish herself as the owner of dozens of businesses and file returns on their behalf.  The FR-500 forms were not submitted for review before processing, BDO found, and no verification checks were performed.  The loophole was a glitch, OTR explained. The agency's Integrated Tax System was supposed to deny ownership changes requested through the FR-500 function, but "faulty logic" allowed the updates automatically. Umansky said a fix is now in place and "that can't happen again."<br>

The letter does not give technical details about the breach, but it indicates the unidentified source sent FINRA a username and password to the portfolio management system.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Organized computer criminals yanked more than $200,000 out of the online bank accounts of a Missouri dental practice this month, in yet another attack that exposes the financial risks that small- to mid-sized organizations face when banking online.

Smile Zone is still investigating how the thieves compromised the account. But in case after case I’ve reported on involving this type of fraud, the attackers hacked the victim’s computer networks using a Trojan horse program known as Zeus or Zbot, which allows the criminals to tunnel back through the victim’s PC in order to log into the target account without raising red flags or additional security mechanisms.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> The attack, which took place overnight, saw a message from the Iranian Cyber Army appear on the Baidu home page. It featured a picture of the Iranian flag, and a message written in Farsi.

Here’s how Baidu alleges the hacker got access to one of the world’s most popular web sites domain name account in under an hour:
1. Hacker starts online chat session with Register.com representative, claiming to be an agent of Baidu.
2. Register.com representative asks hacker to provide verification information. Hacker provides invalid information, but Register.com goes ahead and e-mails a security code to the email address it has on file for Baidu anyway.
3. The hacker doesn’t have access to that e-mail address, so he/she relays a bogus security code to the Register.com representative via chat. Baidu claims the representative didn’t bother to compare the code to the actual one.
4. Hacker asks Register.com representative to change email address on file to antiwahabi2008@gmail.com, and representative does.
5. Hacker now uses “forgot password” link at Register.com to request the username and password to the account. Hacker can then log in and change the name servers.<br>

The 24-year-old man from central France was arrested on Tuesday and could face up to two years in prison in France for fraudulent access to a computer system. The arrest followed a joint operation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the French police, according to French state prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat.

"We saw thousands of hits on our Department of Transportation driver license exam scheduling site coming out of Russia, the same thing over and over, scheduling driver license exams. It was encrypted traffic, and we were trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Were they trying to test our systems? What exactly were they up to? The answer was, we really didn't know."
Authorities eventually discovered that the hacker who used a proxy server in Russia to mask his identity owned a driving school in Philadelphia, and exploited a vulnerability in the driving test scheduling system to allow the scheduling of more tests than the allotted time slots. It could take upward of six weeks to schedule a driving test in Philadelphia. Said Maley:

"What he was doing was saying (to potential customers), "You go over across the street, to John's driver training, and it's going to take you six to eight weeks to get your test. We can get you in tomorrow."<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Not exactly a startup news per se, but a healthy reminder to all those working with user credentials in their online services. One of the largest, if not the largest, online identity thefts has just occured in Finland. The service to be breached was Älypää, a Sanoma bought gaming site. The sad part is that while an identity breach of this magnitude is always bad – this has been made worse by Sanoma actually storing the passwords in plain text, making them usable anywhere.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A New York marketing firm that as recently as two weeks ago was preparing to be acquired now is facing bankruptcy from a computer virus infection that cost the company more than $164,000.
Immediately before the fraud occurred, Mrs. McCarthy found that her Windows PC would no longer boot, and that the computer complained it could not find vital operating system files. “She was using it one day and then this blue screen of death just came on her screen,” said a longtime friend who was helping McCarthy triage her computer.

Later, McCarthy’s friend would confirm that her system had been infected with the ZeuS Trojan, a potent family of malware that steals passwords and lets cyber thieves control the infected host from afar. ZeuS also includes a feature called “kill operating system,” which criminals have used in prior bank heists to effectively keep the victim offline and buy themselves time to make off with the cash.

Karen McCarthy said TDBank has dug in its heels and is now saying it has no responsibility for the loss.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> In a separate incident on March 4, organized crooks stole roughly $130,000 from North Garland County Regional Water District, a public, nonprofit utility in Hot Springs, Ark. Again, thieves somehow broke into the utility’s online bank account and set up unauthorized transfers to more than a dozen individuals around the country that were not affiliated with the district.

Manager Bill Reinhardt said the district is still investigating how the thieves gained access to its accounts, and that it had notified the FBI about the breach. Reinhardt said the district has so far worked with its bank to reverse about half of the fraudulent transfers.<br>

The incident, which was first reported by blogger Brian Krebs this week, involves Lubbock-based PlainsCapital bank and its customer Hillary Machinery Inc. of Plano.

In November, unknown attackers based in Romania and Italy initiated a series of unauthorized wire transfers from Hillary's bank accounts and depleted it by $801,495. About $600,000 of the amount was later recovered by PlainsCapital.<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> Georgia, USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> A fascinating story about a group of hackers who broke into the RBS WorldPay DBs through SQL Injection.  Russian authorities have nabbed the man accused of masterminding a coordinated global ATM heist of $9.5 million from Atlanta-based card processing company RBS WorldPay.  The hackers compromised RBS WorldPay’s database encryption to raise the amount of funds available on the compromised cards, and boost their daily withdrawal limits. In some case, the hackers raised the limits to $500,000.  According to the indictment, Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system. Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access. Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse engineering the encrypted PINs.  Once the hackers raised the account limits, they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards programmed with the account details. On November 8 that year, the cashers simultaneously hit more than 2,000 ATMs, netting about $9.5 million in less than 12 hours.

The story did not specify the exact vulnerabilities exploited to manipulate the DB however the Indictment PDF (in the reference) lists actual SQL commands sent to the DBs (pages 10-11).

If you then cross-reference this story with WHID entry 2009-51 where the Romania Hacker Unu released SQL Injection vulns in RBS WorldPay web applications, it seems most plausible that these Russian Hackers used similar vulnerabilities.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> McAfee, a leading maker of Internet security software, warned this week that software systems used by many companies to store and manage their intellectual property are being actively targeted by hackers and are in need of significantly increased security focus.

McAfee took issue with Perforce’s implementation of access controls. For instance, using the Web interface, someone who manages to access one user account could access those of other users by manipulating the associated URL, or Web address, it said. Perforce responded that, if customers choose the systems most restrictive mode, that situation isn’t possible.<br>

Prosecutors said the men hired a hacker in Bulgaria  to program a way around the "CAPTCHA" technology that requires ticket buyers to read and retype two distorted random words to prove they are people, not a computer program.  In a spectacular irony, the defendents managed to take a process meant to distinguish between a human and a machine - and automate it.  The indictment said they even programmed their bots to make mistakes so they would appear to be human ticket buyers.  When the bots swarmed a Web site, they were able to fill out the CAPTCHA fields in a twinkling, beating any real human buyers.

<b>Incident Description:</b> Bangladesh government websites, operating out of the Prime Minister's Office, were attacked on Saturday by hackers purporting to be "Indian" .

bdnews24.com, at around 2.30am, found that 19 out of 64 district web portals had been hacked by "MIL INDIAN HACKER", threatening "cyber war" in retaliation to any terrorist attack by Pakistan on Indian soil "via Bangladesh".

Most of the sites were fixed around 16 hours later, said officials, who in some cases had first been notified of the cyber attack by bdnews24.com's online report.

The hacked portals displayed a poster on opening, which said: 28 DIFFERENT STATES, 28 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT ONE WORD JAI HIND!'<br>

Elite U.S. military computer specialists, over the objections of the CIA, mounted a cyberattack that dismantled the online forum.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Attacker(s) conducted a DDoS attack against the Florida Candidate for Governor Paula Dockery's website.  In essence, what is happening is someone is sending approximately 40,000 requests per second to the website/server, then immediately closing them… It is the equivalent of 2.4 million people a minute browsing to the site and closing it immediately.  In essence this saturates the number of connections available to legitimate people trying to get to the server, causing them to time-out when they visit the site.  In security terms it is called a Denial of Service Attack (DoS).<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Hackers, working for BroCo Investments (a one-trader operation based in St. Petersburg, Russia) used stolen online brokerage credentials to initiate a pump-and-dump scheme.  Within minutes of making the unauthorized transactions, the SEC claims BroCo then sold shares of these same stocks held in its own account at the artificially inflated prices, netting the hackers more than $250,000 in profits.

From a defensive perspective, the online brokerage accounts should be doing more to authenticate users and validate transactions.  The challenging part is that these types of defensive mechanisms may actually interfere with many of the automated bot programs that investors use to monitor and execute trades.  Online trading fraud is not going to go away anytime soon.

Operated by Cleveland-based Pay Technologies, the system lets car dealers install a small black box under vehicle dashboards that responds to commands issued through a central website, and relayed over a wireless pager network. The dealer can disable a car’s ignition system, or trigger the horn to begin honking, as a reminder that a payment is due.  The hacker destroyed account records and then started to disable cars/force the horn to honk continuously.

RBS WorldPay maintains Unu accessed a test database that didn't carry any live data, and that no merchant or cardholder data accounts were compromised. The company has since taken down the pages.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> A new attack by hackers Dec. 17 redirected Twitter users to a page from a previously unknown group called the Iranian Cyber Army.  Most computer attacks are relatively straightforward denial-of-service attacks, where computers overwhelm a website with data to bring it down. Thursday night's attack against Twitter was more serious because the hackers gained access to part of Twitter's network and were able to redirect users to a page with a photo of a flag with Farsi script. Near the top of the page ran a bold red headline in English: "This site has been hacked by Iranian Cyber Army."

Hackers for several days have attacked the websites of opponents of Iran's regime and posted the same image. The opponents have used social-media sites like Twitter to organize street protests this year.<br>

The earlier reports were carried by news organisations worldwide after a Los Angeles based public relations consultant, who has represented Morrison in the past, apparently confirmed the claim on Tuesday.

However, the statement issued by Van Morrison said: "I have asked my management team to carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my website on December 29th last.

"This is the second occasion on which the website has been hacked into during the last three months. In this most recent incident, claims were made relating to my personal life in a "statement'' purporting to come from me.<br>

<p>We all know that web security is highly important but neglected. We tell frightening stories but listners think they are only "FUD": fear, uncertainty and doubt, used to sell products and services. I hope that the VAServ incident will serve to warn that those are not fairytale stories. Even so, I wish this one would not have happened.</p>
<p>In this story, like most calamities, it seems that the laymen suffer: small entrepreneurs &amp; upstart companies who lost everything in a hacking incident. One of them even lost his life.</p>

<p>It all started on Sunday, June 7<sup>th</sup>: someone broke into the web servers of VAServ, a tiny UK based hosting company. The hackers ruined many of VAServ virtual servers. Some of them lost were for ever as the snippet from VAServ home page, serving as an emergency bulletin board, shows.</p>
<p>As tiny as VAServ is, probably no more than 3 people, in today's virtual and flat world they could serve tens of thousands of low cost web sites, many of them now lost for ever. Behind each one of these web sites there is a story of someone who worked hard, whether on a hobby or a small business and is now left with nothing. A comment made on one of the blog entries about the incident reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><em>"yeah thanks for ruining my life for the last 2 years i had built up my site spending alot of money and giving up my job for nothing.........what am i going to tell the wife?"</em></p>
<p>Just think about tens of thousand of such stories. Daniel Voyce, a web developer using VAServ for all of his clients, told the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/08/webhost_attack/">Register: </a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><em>"Since last night, I've had probably 40 phone calls from clients saying 'Why is my website down, It's making me look bad."</em></p>
<p>But this domino effect ruining so many small businesses had another even more devastating angle. Just days before the hack, someone <a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/8880">posted on milw0rm</a> a long list of yet unpatched vulnerabilities in Kloxo, a virtual machine management software. The list certainly looks comprehensive enough to enable anyone to penetrate a site using Kloxo, which VAServ where, leading VAServ and others to believe that LxLabs, the Bangalorian software company behind Kloxo is the culprit. Somebody claiming to be the hacker <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/25617/update-new-information-on-the-vaserv-hack-that-wiped-100k-sites/">commented to the inquistir blog</a>, claiming that weak password at VAServ where to blame for the hack, which <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/10/vaserv_follow_up/">Rus Foster from VAServ denied</a>.</p>
<p>We may never know who is right and who is wrong. LxLabs, just like Vaserv, is a tiny company using the Internet to look big. However one area that suffers a lot in small companies, is their security. It is never important enough to invest resource in security in such a lean and mean operations.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/ligesh.jpg" width="179" height="206" style="float:right">But tiny giants have another weakness: it all falls on the shoulders of too few people. In the case of LxLabs, on <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bangalore/Techie-hangs-himself-in-HSR-Layout-/articleshow/4633101.cms">KT Ligesh the CEO</a>. Ligesh<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bangalore/Techie-hangs-himself-in-HSR-Layout-/articleshow/4633101.cms"> committed suicide</a> just a day after the hack for which his company was blamed. While already a troubled person, one cannot escape the thought that the hacking incident was the last straw.</p><br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> What does a challenge to break an web mail system and get $10,000, broken within minutes prove? Is it a lesson in vanity? Or about the state of web security? Or about security in general. Probably all.

The most obvious observatoins is that offering $10,000 for anyone who can break your site and being broken within an hour shows that you don't know what you taking about. Maybe it would be a lesson to all security vendors to not believe their own marketing verbiage. A quick browse of the bugtraq vulnerability archives will show how insecure and easy to evade security products can be.

However, judging from the number and seriousness of the incidents reported on the web hacking incidents database, StrongWebmail is not alone and far stronger companies suffers severe incidents, making web applications the weakest link in an organizations information security.

Lastly, we should always remember that there is never perfect security. By making systems more secure we are just raising the price required to attack them and lowering the damage of such an attack, but never. As the old joke goes: the only secure system is one without users.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> Attacking web sites by going to the source, targeting DNS servers rather than the web sites themselves shows both the boldness of hackers as well as the fragility of the Internet.

While not new, DNS hijacking attacks took an important turn this year showing how much we rely on the web and now little we care for its protection. In the past DNS hijacking required complete control over the DNS server. In recent years most applications are controlled through a web interface, including DNS servers. Earlier this year attackers found an XSS vulnerability in a common DNS platform to hijack unused DNS entries for phishing

But this was only a small prelude to the real thing. CNet reports that this time hackers took over an entire TLD (Top Level Domain, or country) DNS server using SQL injection, virtually defacing the Puerto Rican site of companies such as Google and Microsoft.

The amazing story unfolds in the comments to CNet story, which outlines a mischievous professor and slow authorities who let him privatize and monetize on domain registration in Puerto Rico without any control.

The question we are left with is whether other countries and geographies different? Or even other industries for that matter?<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> The register reports that Digital Spy, a high profile UK gossip site carried banner inflicting ads. Digital Spy has acknowledged the issue and said it promptly addressed it, however details on the source of the malicious banners is still not availalbe.

Malware distribution through ad programs is a borderline phenomenon. While there is no question that malware distribucion is malicious, and in most geographies illegal, in many cases the site owners are not technically responsible for the content of the ads they serve  as the ad content comes directly from a 3rd party. The question whether they are legally responsible is open.

Another issue is defining a malware. Many times ads are used to entice users to download and install programs that are questionable. a rootkit installed through a known browser vulnerability is a malware, however the distinction between adware and malware is many time blurred and depends on:

The ratio between benefit to the user and benefit to the software distributor, 
The clarity in which the benefit to the software distributor is explained to the user, and lastly: 
The legality of this benefit<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Polls are easy target for automation abuse. You can usually participate anonymously and the poll operator has an interest in drawing as many participants as possible, but as <a href="http://www.xiom.com/whid-2009-3">demonstrated by previous incidents</a> such loose security enables hackers to distort the results.</p>
<p>This time <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/17/time_top_100_hack/">a <span>hacker</span> <span>succeeded</span> in manipulating</a> <span>Time's</span> poll for most <span>influential</span> people in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1886141,00.html"><img src="http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/time_poll_hacked.png" alt="Top results for the hacked Time poll" width="480" height="156"></a></p>
<p>Such poll are probably always <span>distorted</span> by automated programs,  with every stakeholder running his own robot to promote a cause. The <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1886141,00.html">current time poll status</a> <span>Shawn</span> above includes mostly known people, though the standings do seem skewed. Is it just that our view of the world is different than others, or have <span>Muslims</span> around the world become avid Time readers? The top rated person, "moot", which none of you heard about until now, proves that it is all about automation.</p>
<p>This specific poll distortion <a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-hack/">reported by Paul <span><span>Lamere</span></span></a> is unique since a group of hackers called 4chan, led by "moot", took the time to fight Time's humble attempts to mitigate automation. Among the measures and countermeasures that 4chan and Time exchanged are:</p>
<ul>
<li>4chan distributed the simple get URL required to vote for moot through legitimate web sites and comment spamming. Such a link can easily be executed automatically by a web site user without his awareness using CSRF techniques.</li>
<li>Using a typical CSRF counter measure, Time added a salted and hashed key to ensure that the poll was submitted from its own poll form. However the key was authentication on the client by <span>Time's</span> poll Flash application <span>enabling</span> 4<span><span>chan</span></span> to easily find it out and overcome the issue. </li>
<li>The Time voting mechanism did not even check that the ranking in the vote was legal, so a link to vote down "moot" competitors in the list was also used until Time fixed the issue. Voting down is key to winning such a poll as 4chan competitors are not at rest running their own sophisticated campaigns.</li>
<li>Lastly 4chan developed sophisticated robots to auto-vote. Those robots overcome Time's anti-automation protections: since each user is allowed to vote just once in every 13 seconds, the robots uses open proxies to vote faster. Since time only prevents voting for the same person from the same IP, the robots used the extra 12 seconds available for each source IP to vote down competitors. The system also reports to a central server allowing monitoring of the voting rate!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/4chan_voting_rate.png" alt="Rate of voting for &quot;rain&quot; as recorded by 4chan monitoring" width="480" height="149"></p>
<p>However this specific hack is ever more interesting. At one point 4<span><span>chan</span></span> where bored with just running moot for presidency, so they decided to use their sophisticated machine to do a more elaborate work. They <span>decided to fix all first 21 nominees so that their initials would spell "<span>Marblecake</span> Also the Game". And as </span><a href="http://musicmachinery.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/kg9kl.jpg?w=450&amp;h=460">Paul <span><span>Lamere</span></span>'s screenshot</a> proves, they made it.</p><br>

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2009-37: Twitter XSS/CSRF worm series (Updated)<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2009-37<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 4/11/2009<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> Cross Site Scripting (XSS)<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Output Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Worm<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Web 2.0<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p><em><strong>Update (Apr 19<sup>th</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - The initial Mooney Twitter worm has evolved into a series of 5 worms at the time of writing, each exploiting a different vulnerability in Twitter. The latest one specifically focuses on twitter accounts who have a high number of followers thus targeting celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher and Oprah Winfrey <a href="http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2009/04/17/mikeyy-worm-targets-oprah-york-times/">according to Graham Cluley</a> from Sophos.</p>
<p>The hack seems to have paid of to Mikeyy Mooney who was <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9131737&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head">hired to as security consultant</a> following the incident.</p>
<hr>
<p>Twitter is in the spotlights again. Mikeyy Mooney, the 17-year-old creator of StalkDaily.com, a Twitter alternative, <a href="http://www.bnonews.com/news/242.html">admitted </a>to hacking his giant competitor by implementing a worm that propagated itself through twitter making every affected user tweet about StalkDaily. Mikeyy certainly got the advertising and page views he was looking for.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/Mikeyy_270x246.png" alt="Mikeyy Mooney, the Twitter worms creator" width="270" height="246" style="float:right">Mikeyy's worm is a good example of how CSRF and XSS can be combined to create a strong blended attack, in this case a propagating worm. A Web 2.0 community generated site such as twitter is often vulnerable to stored XSS . This often implies that a user can update his own profile with malicious code and as a result others who view his content get hit. Without any other vulnerability to complicate things, you are safe as long as your friends are trustworthy.</p>
<p>However, if the site is also vulnerable to CSRF, the XSS exploit can include in addition to the payload also the original XSS inflicting code run under the attacked users credential, modifying his content and therefore hiting his own friends, which hit their own friends and so on.</p>
<p>You can find the technical details of the attack on <a href="http://dcortesi.com/2009/04/11/twitter-stalkdaily-worm-postmortem/">Damon Cortesi's blog</a>. You may also be interested in the <a href="http://gist.github.com/93782">full XSS payload</a>.</p><br>

Leakage of information from an energy company is usually associated with gas stations fraud such as installing a stealth credit card reader at the pump. However, a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2269256/Hackers-steal-Shell-customer-info">report</a> suggests that an incident in which information about 4500 Australian and 1400 Kiwis leaked was a result of  a glitch in a web based application for applying for a Shell fuel card. The information obtained included company names, address details, email addresses and some bank account details.<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Norm Coleman, a former senator from Minnesota, is going through a legal battle to try to win back his seat in the senate. If the way he manages his web site security and the crises it created are an indicator, I am not sure that he has a place there.</p>
<p>The Coleman team <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41127537.html?elr=KArks8c7PaP3E77K_3c::D3aDhUec7PaP3E77K_0c::D3aDhUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr">called in the US Secret Service</a> to investigate the leak in which sensitive information about more than 4700 donors was published on Wikileaks, a web site devoted to such exposures. Coleman himself called the incident "an obviously an attack on my campaign".</p>
<p>However the Minnesota Independent <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/28711/breaking-colemans-unsecured-donorbase-to-be-revealed-on-wikileaks">reveals </a>that the information was exposed for anyone to view on the senator's web site since at least January 28<sup>th</sup>. Hardly an attack. At the time the site was suffering performance issues and in a debate about the cause somebody <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/24761/disenfranchised-voters-crash-colemans-site-unlikely-says-blogger#comment-24131">commented </a>to an Independent about the an exposed database, which the Independent was fast to <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/24817/crashgate-reveals-unprotected-database-on-colemans-site">report </a>on. Moreover, Wikileaks took the trouble to inform the people in the list that their information leaked, while it took the Senator team over a month to react.</p><br>

<p>A very detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability is included in a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=481558">FireFox community discussions</a> on whether the issue is a browser or a web site issue. As usual, the truth is somewhere in the middle. The FireFox team selected to correct the issue discovered in FireFox. Microsoft claimed that the issue exploited in IE, which is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/08/ebay_scam_wizardy/">reported </a>to be a CSS expression issue, is not feature and not a bug and the vulnerable web site should be fixed.</p><br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>While we have no public record of an exploit in this case, it seems that the mare discovery of vulnerabilities in sage new SaaS (software as a service) offering created so much damage to classify it as an incident.</p>
<p>Sage is the leading provider of accounting software in the UK and it was about to launch a trendy small business SaaS offering. However as <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=655">ZDnet reports</a>, serious security flaws were discovered in the public beta and the company has to call off the launch. Who discovered the issues? naturally the competition. Duane Jackson, the CEO of a tiny rival company <a href="http://blog.kashflow.com/2009/01/21/sage-live-security/">reported</a> them on his blog<span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">More than anything, the incident shows how difficult it is for developers to migrate from desktop software to a web based offering. This is a whole new ball game, and security is one of the more difficult issues to adjust to. On the other hand it also shows that on line services are much more exposed to scrutiny, which may result in better security down the line.<br></span></span></p>
<p><span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">As for the technical details, the reports found that the following issues in the application:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">Password displayed in clear text and sent in the request line.</span></span></li>

The attack involves directly attacking HSMs, the banks key vaults in charge of verifying ATM PINs in order to brute force PIN numbers.</p>
<p>The report is unique in describing an attack on financial services. Such attacks are know to happen but are seldom reported, certainly not with the amount of details in this report.

<p>As usual, the marketing department <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10163227-83.html">response </a>is amazing, mentioning that "<em>the problem with its site was due to a bug in a Web application and not related to an unpatched system</em>". Does that make it better?</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't envy the marketing department role. The company, any company for that matter, is spending too little on web application security, sites are taken down daily, and the marketing people are send to fend off the public. They must have a thick skin to survive in marketing.</p><br>

<p>The scam exploits an XSS vulnerability in <a href="http://www.scripts24.com/iredirector/subdomain/index.php">iRedirector</a>, a software used to map sub-domains into paths on the site, in order to hijack domains and use them as Phishing targets. Since iRedirector enables virtually any sub domain to be defined, the attacker can now create an endless number of combinations of domain names built to fool users and web filters alike.</p><br>

<hr>
<p>Whenever we include a site inflicted with malware in WHID we need to explain why this one is worthy of WHID, after hundreds of thousands of web sites are planted with malware annually.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/02/travel-booking_site_for_federa.html">Washington Post</a> report about govtrip.com spreading malware is unique because this is an official US General Services Administration (GSA)  web site and many US federal departments employees are required to reserve travel through it. In addition, the site is run by a major defense contractor, Northrop Grumman, who you would think would know better. How secure are their defense projects when it comes to application security?</p><br>

<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Input Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Leakage of Information<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Media<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>I must admit that Uno, the Romanian hacker behind a series of intrusions in recent days is a bit of a cheat for the Web Hacking Incident Database. We usually do not report vulnerabilities that where not exploited. While we understand their importance, they do not fall under the <a href="/whid-faq">criteria </a>set for WHID. For now we list them in a <a href="/research-web-site-vuln">separate page</a>, waiting for a place to be files in.</p>
<p>Uno presents a dilemma: he finds a vulnerability, exploits it to a limit and publish the results. Therefore the incident does not have a sizable outcome and not damage is done, but nevertheless it is interesting. We are not the only one to note that. Kasperski stressed the point the no data was actually compromised in their <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753">response </a>to the event. So should we add it to WHID as an incident? should we skip it as just a vulnerability? for now we put them in.</p>
<p>So what is Uno's mischeif this time? <a href="http://hackersblog.org/2009/02/17/international-herald-tribune-nytimescom-sqlinjection/">This time</a> it is the International Herald Tribune Uno is after. The impact of this attack, if carried out by a malicious hacker might have been profound as it seems that Uno got access to user name and passwords of editors and contributors, posibily enabling a malicious hacker to publish information on their behalf on this very prestigious newspaper.</p><br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p><em><strong>Update (Feb 22<sup>nd</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - We were probably not the only ones not satisfied with Kasperski official press release on the subject. An interesting <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=208187633&amp;return=1">report </a>on Kasperski viruslist blog by a person on the investigating team provides answers: the data was neither secured well nor the hacker incapable. The hacker made a mistake in his attack vector and decided to pursue no further. The data was available for any hacker who was really after it.</p>
<p>I must tkae my hat off to Kasperski for this frank analysis, which is very uncommon to companies who were breached and can really help to highlight the importance of application security.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 13<sup>th</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - Kasperski hired David Litchfield, a well known database security expert, to analyze the incident. In their <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753">response, </a>Ksaperski point that no sensitive data was actually compromised  to the event. The report points that the hacker and others following his hints did try to access sensitive data but did not succeed. The carefully worded report does leave many questions open:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Was the data secured well, or were the hackers who tried to access it just not capable?</li>
<li>Was no data vulnerable or just "sensitive data" and if so what is the data that was exposed?</li>
<li>Did the investigation go back to check that no one hacked the system prior to the published incident, potentially abusing it and avoiding publication?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>A researcher <a href="http://hackersblog.org/2009/02/07/usakasperskycom-hacked-full-database-acces-sql-injection/">found and exploited</a> a serious SQL injection vulnerability in US web site of Kasperski, an anti-virus software vendor, exposing the full customers database. Well, the full database actually as the list of tables exposed proves. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/09/kaspersky_compromise_follow_up/">Apparently</a>, the vulnerability existed for some time and the researched informed Kasperski about it to no avail before making it public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is another example of how fatal is SQL injection. SQL Injection is considered one of the more well understood attack vectors, easy to find during a security review, and therefore easy to get rid of. However one of its variants, blind SQL injection, can appear everywhere in the application and not just in key pages managing sensitive information and expose the entire database, making a review and fix of the application from it much harder.</p><br>

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2009-18: phpBB web site hacked using LFI<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2009-18<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 2/1/2009<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> Local File Inclusion (LFI)<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Input Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Leakage of Information<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Technology<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>phpBB was known for years as one of the most insecure software packages out there. It is responsible for one for one of the 1st application layer worm, <a href="/whid-2004-14">Santy</a> back in 2004. How ironic is that its own web site was seriously breached due to a vulnerability in another software package used...</p>
<p>The culprit was an<a href="http://www.bugreport.ir/index_60.htm"> LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability in PHPlist</a>, an application for managing newsletters which enables the hacker to grab phpBB users list. Another researcher <a href="http://www.suspekt.org/2009/02/06/some-facts-about-the-phplist-vulnerability-and-the-phpbbcom-hack/">claims </a>that this is not an LFI but a super-globals-overwrite, which is still used to include files.</p>
<p>However, phpBB is not entirely off the hook, as the phpBB team <a href="http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=29973">admits</a>. The stolen files included only hashed passwords, however phpBB 2 hash was unsalted and the hackers successfully brute forced 28,000 passwords. While phpBB 3, which is used on the phpBB site uses better password hashing, the upgrade procedure did not upgrade existing users waiting for their 1st login to upgrade. Anyone who did not log-in to the web site since the upgrade still had weakly hashed password in the database.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://hackedphpbb.blogspot.com/2009/01/place-holder.html">very detailed report </a>of the incident by the hacker shed light on how such hacks are carried out, including what the hacker went after and his exploitation techniques . The hacker found the exploit on <a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7778">milw0rm</a>, a well known exploit repository, showing that public disclosure of vulnerabilities has its price, especially when it precedes the release if the patch.</p>

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2009-16: Primary schools hit by smut hack<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2009-16<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 1/30/2009<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> Known Vulnerability<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Application Misconfiguration<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Defacement<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Education<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> UK<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Not all defacement are created equal. I have a second grader who has just started to use her school's web site so this defacement of 20 primary school web sites with porn hit me deep inside. We do so much to screen our young ones from the sleazy world outside, and getting it in the school's web site is just unimaginable. Just thinking about the questions I would be asked if my daughter would get such pages.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/04/school_website_defacement/">incident </a>also highlights the total breakup of cyber security. The incident is blamed on an unpatched version of Moodle, an open source on-line education software. The naive way ot thinking would be that schools don't have the budgets to protect their applications or even to upgrade them. However, as this incident shows, proper security is fundamental and a substantial part of the budget should be allocated to it, even it means we spend less on the application features. We need to move slower but ensure security. After all, what is the value of an educational system that shows porn?</p>
<p>Another insight is that real time controls for protecting web applications are essential. You need a WAF. While the specific vulnerability exploited is unknown, Installing <a href="/modsecurity">ModSecurity</a> would have probably prevented the exploit.</p><br>

<p>West's story is somewhat ironic as he used his blog to remind users of the untruthfulness of his web presence.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Ismael Valenzuela sent us <a href="http://blog.ismaelvalenzuela.com/2009/01/26/embassy-of-india-in-spain-found-serving-remote-malware-through-iframe-attack/">a story</a> about yet another malware through iFrame serving site. This time it is an official one, belonging to the Indian government official branch in Spain - it's embassy.</p>
<p>We can hardly include every malware service site in WHID, after all there are hundred of thousands, if not millions, of those. Why pick on the Indian embassy in Spain? One good reason is that we finally got in an input from a reader and wanted to honor the event and include the incident. But there is another more important reason.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/23/embassy_sites_serve_malware/">hacked embassy sites are becoming a major issue</a> which points to a much larger issue: cyber crime is endangering the Internet as we know it. While we come to rely on the web to provide us with all the information and services that we need, we do not have the tools to make it a safe place, and embassy web sites are a good example.</p>
<p>Practically the only way to provide sufficient security to a web site is not to have it in the first place. Instead small organizations must rely on the services of huge brokers, such as Amazon, eBay or Google sites. However not everyone can use this services. Embassies are a good example as they need to be "doubly localized" for both the originating and target countries which makes it nearly impossible to create a uniform service for them. Therefore even embassies of larger countries need to create small home made and insecure web sites, as they need to adjust their site content, language and site look to the local community served.</p>

They might be the first generation of artists to use the web, brightly combining great Internet skills with technophobia which leads to basic operational errors. Or it might be the underground nature of the artists that (mis)manage their web presence by themselves.</p>
<p>Lil Kim is joining Soulja Boy in being cyber abuse, or so <a href="http://hiphop.popcrunch.com/lil-kim-facebook-hacked/">she claims</a>, saying that a blog entry calling Naturi Naughton, the actress who portrays her in a new film, “tasteless and talentless.”, is a fake.</p><br>

<p>This is a wonderful example of a web application design flaw. There was nothing wrong with the code, however the design of the feature enabled it to be abused.</p>

<p>Probably yet another fallout from the on going Asprox attack, this incident is interesting as it emphasises the responsibility that customers expect service providers to take in protecting from web based attacks.</p><br>

While his <a href="http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2009/01/07/i-know-what-your-friends-did-last-summer/">post </a>included a proof of concept code, it does not qualify as a hack only a vulnerability disclosure and the Web Hacking Incident Database does not list vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Luckily <img alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <a href="http://maone.net/">Giorgio Maone</a> decided to create his own proof of concept, run it himself and <a href="http://hackademix.net/2009/01/13/twitter-json-hijacking-updates/">provide us with the result</a>, enabling me to label this as a hack</p>
<p>By exploiting a CSRF bug in twitter (or maybe a feature?) site owners can get twitter profiles of their visitors. For Twitter this is a second this year and now the comprise 50% of the web incidents for 2009. Is this going to be the year of Web 2.0 security?</p>

Twitter does not block repetitive login failures therefore enabling brute force attacks.

<p>Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/01/monday-morning-madness.html">announced </a>that a hacker broke into 33 accounts including Obama's now inactive twitter. The hack is a result of a flaw in a web based support tool used by twitter, which where evidently accessible externally without proper authorization.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this incident is not related to <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/01/gone-phishing.html">Twitter phishing attack</a> which occurred on the previous weekend.</p>
<p>This incident highlights the issue of public facing administration interfaces, which often combine strong functionality with lesser attention to quality and therefore security. As organizations virtualize, those interfaces become available over the Internet, often without sufficient protection.</p>

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2009-1: Gaza conflict cyber war<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2009-1<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> Update (Jan 13, 2009) - Ynet, an Israeli paper, reports that many of the sites defaced where actually DNS hijacked following a break-in to the servers of DomainTheNet, an Israeli registrar. And just like other recent DNS hijacking incidents, the fault was lack of sufficient authentications and the hackers got hold of passwords to the administration system.

Update (Jan 10, 2009) - Zone-H reports that in addition to Israeli sites, Turkish hackers are also targetting USA and Nato web sites using SQL injection.

The war in Gaza, like most modern wars, moved immediately to cyberspace. Islamic and Arab groups all over the world are using the Internet to retaliate against Israeli web sites. Some of the reported incidents are:
<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/158570">Israeli bank site hacked by an Islamic group</a>
<a href="http://www.darkreading.com/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212700313">Hundreds of Israeli web sites hacked in 'Propaganda War'</a>

Like every war, this one is not one sided. Interestingly enough, since this is a war between a country and a Guerrilla organization, and the cyber war which focus on mostly on conquering the minds of people is shaped similarly. The Israeli cyber war activity is mostly funneled through legal channels rather than hacking, as described by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/12/israels-info-wa.html">Wired</a>.

However, unlike the physical war in which only the Israeli military is conducting, in cyberspace Israelis join by themselves the hacking war. Artuz 7, an Israeli media site, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129223">reports </a>that a group of students released a tool that perform distributed denial of service attacks against Hamas web sites. The <a href="http://www.help-israel-win.org/index.php?lang=eng">students site itself</a> provides news alerts about the cyber war between Israel and the Hamas.

Editor's notes: (1) As a policy, we decided to report each such conflict as a single incident, unless some hack is especiallly of interest. The author of this incident is Israeli.<br>

<hr>
<p>Celebs are fast becoming a prime hacking target. Miley Cyrus already made her debut at WHID when her Twitter account was raided. But it seems that this was not her first cyber incident for her. As <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/miley-cyrus-hac.html">reported by Wired</a>, late last year a hacker named  Josh Holly published private photos of Ms. Cyrus stolen from her G-mail account.</p>
<p>The hack was a relatively sophisticated one and a very good example of the risks of Web 2.0. Holly penetrated a MySpace administrator using social engineering. Using the account he gained access to a list of passwords which MySpace stored in an unencrypted form. Unbelievable. Since most of us use the same password for multiple services, Holly used Cyrus' MySpace password on her G-mail account gaining access and retrieving the photographs.</p>
<p>In a related but yet unconfirmed story Holly claims to have used the MySpace administrative account for an advertising scam by which he gained $50,000.</p><br>

Spotify is a new music streaming radio like service from Sweden. A weakness in <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify </a>streaming protocols enables hackers to gain access to users' encrypted passwords, email address, birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of this incident is that while the vulnerability has been discovered and fix on December 19<sup>th</sup>, the fact that it was actually exploited was discovered only in March 2009. Many times companies report that a vulnerability was found on there site, but they are not aware of any exploit of the vulnerability. As this incident shows, even if the company is not aware, there is a chance that the vulnerability was exploited.</p><br>

Since Captcha has been proved practically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Circumvention">useless</a>, especially when there is a financial gain from automating access to the site, sites are pretty much defenceless against harmful automation. <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080523/0327151211.shtml">Techdirt's story</a> about Craigslist losing the battle against automation tool is a very good example of this serious problem.</p>
<p>Read the comments, they are enlightening. As usual, one of the problem when spam is involved is defining if and what is a wrong doing and what is a  valid action. Some commenters say that Craigslist has become useless due to the spam, while others say that Craiglist is the worst censors on the Internet not letting small time businesses work. Other argue about whether this is a crime or not. 132 comments, and they keep coming 8 months after the article has been published.</p><br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>This is a first time a hacking report is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHOCC99UaKs">video flick</a>. If, like me, you find it hard to understand, you can read a written summary on this <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4678287a28.html">Kiwi site</a>. I guess that their readers also needed a translation of the speech in the video to English.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, hackers defaced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulja_Boy_Tell_%27Em">Soulja Boy's</a> MySpace page and published his e-mail and YouTube passwords on the net. They demanded $2,500 to give him his web presence back. For an artist that grew our of the Internet this presence is naturally very important, however he is now important enough that his record label was able to contact the different sites to get him his web properties back without paying the money.</p>
<p>In this case I have decided to categorize the attacked entity as Soulja Boy and not MySpace or YouTube, as I used to do in the past. The fact that the attack was against Soulja Boy properties around the web makes him, rather than any technology platform, the attack target.</p><br>

The detailed report is very interesting and highlights one of the worse types of SQL injection out there: remote SQL by design.</p>
<p>A unique form of SQL injection, or even just a close sibling, remote SQL by design is a vulnerability in which the web application accepts SQL statements from the client in the normal course of operation. The SQL statement might be used in a hidden field, or generated on the fly by a client side script. In any case, it is extremely difficult to prevent alteration of the SQL statement by a user in such applications, making the applications highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>To find for yourself how common is this vulnerability, just Google for SELECT, FROM and WHERE in the URL. Amazing.</p><br>

<hr>
<p>Insufficient anti-automation is fast becoming a major, if not the major threat to web application. The reason is that it can be very profitable for the hacker, and on the other hand it is far from a simple vulnerability just requiring a quick fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=a091de62-e480-4cd9-bdd3-32e660081d86&amp;k=9897">TicketMaster on going combat with hackers</a> line bypassing to buy event tickets to resell them for a high price is a very good example of the issue. In this specific example the hackers demonstrate that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Captcha,</a> a method of blocking automated programs by presenting a challenge supposedly difficult for a computer software<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">, </a>is not sufficient.</p><br>

The guide, is presumably limited to federal procurement agents only, but at the time of writing the credential checking was done on the client in JavaScript and for a single global user name and password.</p>
<p>Beyond making a mockery of the claim that the guide was limited to federal agents only, it also seemed to be a marketing method as it limits the potential advertisers from checking who is in the guide. After getting in Alex contacted some of the advertisers to find out that none of them got any value from the guide. Alex did not join, and I wonder how much Alex's report lowered the Federal Suppliers Guide earning.</p><br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>In an attack with an alarming similarity to the COX incident (<a href="/whid-2008-45">WHID 2008-45</a>), but with a far greater potential damage, hackers changes the DNS records for CheckFree, the largest bill payment service in the USA. Customers where redirected to servers in the Ukraine, which attempted to install a password login software on their computers.</p>
<p>The change was done using correct credentials to login to the administrative web site of Network Solutions, CheckFree domain registrar. It is yet unknown how the hackers got the credentials. Since <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/security/sac028.pdf">Phishing attacks against domain registrars</a> including Network Solutions have started to surface recently, a good guess is that it was through a Phishing attack.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://doj.nh.gov/consumer/pdf/fiserv.pdf">CheckFree report to the authorities</a>, it estimates that around 160,000 customers where expoesed to the attack, and informed 5 million potential victims who may have been among this group.</p>

<p>However, we believe that the resulting "virtual" defacement of the web site by redirecting users to a fraudulent web site is still a web hack, even if the DNS hijacking is not web related.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Joomla is a widely used open source  content management system. Many <a href="http://theprogrammerx.wordpress.com/2008/08/23/what-the-hack-is-going-on-three-attacks-within-a-week/">administrators reports</a> that <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/241-20080801-core-password-remind-functionality.html">a vulnerability announced August 12<sup>th</sup></a> was immediately exploited by hackers to attack Joomla based web sites. Another report shows a specific site that was defaced by exploiting the same vulnerability.</p>
<p>This incident shows the importance of timely patching, but also brings back the age old debate around publication of vulnerabilities by researchers. Does it contribute to software security or just helps the hackers?</p><br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Like many Asprox bot SQL injection attacks, the one on NDTV.com, a New Delhi TV station's web site has its unique aspects.</p>
<p>First, the attack came at absolutely the wrong time, just when all eyes (and mouse clicks) where turned to the Olympic games in Beijing, the NDTV web site which carried real time information from the games was hacked, greatly extending the infection rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the information was syndicated from a French news agency. While apparently the agency did not have anything to do with the hack, the did catch some fire over the incident as some experts suggested it should help its customers to protect their systems.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>The South African Democratic Alliance party's web site seems like another random victim of the Asprox family of bots. This specific incident demonstrates several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aprox successfully attacks organizations that should really know better.</li>
<li>While most known cases of Asprox attacks result in planting of malware on the web site, since this is easily detected by malware search services, the very brutal injection used by Asprox probably takes down more sites than it infects with malware.</li>
<li>According to one comment, the site used an outdated version of WordPress, stressing again the problem with not upgrading in a timely manner, especially open source software.</li>

At least, as the saying goes, losing a $100 is your problem; losing a million is the banks.</p>
<p></p><hr>
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) confirmed that a hacker perform a "sophisticated cyber intrusion" on RBS WorldPay Unit web site. 1.5 Million credit card numbers and 1.1 million social security numbers may have been stolen.
<p>At this time the only abuse known is a fraudulent use of about a 100 reloadable cards, which are used by companies to pay their employees.</p>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Up to now we never registered at WHID an incident that caused physical pain on its victims. Unfortunately, there is always a first. In an attack which gives a whole new dimension to the term "malicious",hackers recently injected to the Epilepsy Foundation's Web site hundreds of pictures and links to pages with rapidly flashing images.</p>
<p>The breach caused severe migraines and near-seizure reactions in some site visitors who viewed the images. People with photosensitive epilepsy can get seizures when they're exposed to flickering images, a response also caused by some video games and cartoons.</p>
<p>The Attack_Method is only described as an exploit of a security hole in the foundation's publishing software. However, the attack looks very much like a variation of the popular iframe injection SQL bots, used for malice rather than profit, hinting that this was an SQL injection attack.</p>

<p>The FTC settlement cost ValueClick a record amount of $2.9 million dollars, plus 20 years of rigorous security procedures that will probably cost as much if not more. On top of that, eBay, a major partner, left ValueClick as a result.

<p>We where informed by sources at eBay the Korean sites parent company that the issue was not CRSF or seesion hijacking. The Attack_Method was not disclosed.</p>
<hr>
<p>A Korean e-commerce site was hacked and a staggering number of record, 18 million, where stolen. In the US this would be front news. We don't know if it was front news in Korea, but did not get to the international media.</p>
<p>The attack description is vague but can be best described as session hijacking.</p>
<p>This incident is a great example of the lack of sufficient international coverage at WHID. Help us by sending us non English incidents! After all, it is not English speakers only that get hacked, but rather us, the WHID maintainers that speak only this language.</p>

The current incident is a good example of what does and does not get into our database: XSS vulnerabilities in public web sites are discovered daily and reported in sites such as <a href="http://www.xssed.org/">XSSed</a>, however most of these vulnerabilities are not included in WHID for lack of public interest. The current incident is different since the vulnerability is known to be exploited by attackers, moving it from the realm of technical interest to the realm of a real problem.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p><strong><em>Update (Feb 8<sup>th</sup> 2009)</em></strong> - The company has reached a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823113/index.shtm">settlement </a>with the FTC. Not a breathtaking achievement in the effort to make business care about web application security, yet a step in this direction. The report also identifies the attack as an SQL injection attack.</p>
<hr>
&lt;!--break--&gt;
<p>Very detailed records of geeks.com customers were stolen from the site. The records included name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date, and most notoriously, card verification number (CVV).</p>
<p>The interesting part is that the site had a Hacker Safe seal. The seal was revoked twice last year due to vulnerabilities, but restored after they where patched. It seems that this time the hack preceded the scan or the scan missed the vulnerability. So much for application scanning and vulnerability assessment....</p>
<p>And don't take it lightly as a geeks site. Geeks.com is a $150M/year business.</p>

According to investigation papers Maksym Yastremskiy made approximately 11 million dollars from the hack!</p>
<hr>
<p>The TJX breach is one of most publicized hacking incident in recent years. However, until now it was not part of the Web Hacking Incidents Database. And for a good reason: early report described the hack as a war driving hack, in which the attackers drive around and find a wireless network not properly secured.</p>
<p>However new information from the trial of the identity theft ring leader Albert Gonzalez, reveals that in order to penetrate TJX data center from the captured end points, the hackers employed different techniques including password sniffing and SQL injection. The later justifies getting the TJX incident for the 1st time into WHID.</p>

<b>Attack Method:</b> SQL Injection<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> In his most-recent plea agreement, filed in court Monday, confessed hacker Albert Gonzalez admitted conspiring in the 7-Eleven breach and fingered two Russian associates as the direct culprits. The Russians are identified as “Hacker 1″ and “Hacker 2″ in Gonzalez’s plea agreement, and as “Grigg” and “Annex” in an earlier document inadvertently made public by his attorney.

The Russians, evidently using an SQL injection vulnerability,  “gained unauthorized access to 7-Eleven, Inc.’s servers through 7-Eleven’s public-facing internet site, and then leveraged that access into servers supporting ATM terminals located in 7-Eleven stores,” the plea agreement reads. “This access caused 7-Eleven, Inc., on or about November 9, 2007, to disable its public-facing internet site to disable the unauthorized access.”

First and foremost, it is known to be an XSS abusing a WordPress zero day bug. Secondly, it is a targeted attack aiming to deface only Mac related web sites. Usually targeted defacement attacks are carried out against political targets. Did attacking apple become a political issue? Was Apple transformed into a nation overnight? Well certainly into a cult.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>It is already February, and we still add 2007 incidents. If<br>you wonder why, it is because organizations such as MLS only now find<br>out that they were hacked last year! Sometime between January and<br>August of 2007, names, addresses, credit and debit card data, and<br>passwords of an unknown number of people, including 169 New Hampshire<br>residents were stolen from the site.</p>
<p>Why New Hampshire? Because the company has to report to the<br>authorities there about the incidents, but only specify the number of<br>individuals from this state affected. Why only New Hampshire? Since<br>regulations and bills requiring disclosures exist in many states, one<br>would expect that the company would have to provide such a testimonial<br>in many states. This incident is another good example of the size of<br>the hidden part of the iceberg.</p>

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2007-82: An SQL injection Mass Robot<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2007-82<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 1/8/2008<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> SQL Injection<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Input Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Planting of Malware<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> <br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>An SQL injection robot is running wild and has already hacked hundreds of thousands of web sites. Since the robot plants malicious code in infected sites, its traces can be found by Googling for a name of Chinese sites referred to in malicious code.</p>
<p>As a security practitioner I often see SQL injection bots, and many times when I install ModSecurity, an open source application firewall but this bot is unique in the way it exploits web sites. It is easier to perform a wide scale attack by exploiting the least common denominator, which in the hacking world is the operating system. As a result most SQL bots tend to try to use SQL injection vectors that will enable issuing OS commands. A good example is a <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21799/discuss">Cacti vulnerability</a>: since it allows an OS command to be issued I often see bots looking for it in the wild. This attack is the first I have seen in which the actual attack vector is SQL based. The bot is modifying every record it has access to into a malicious code in the hope that it will be fetched and displayed by the application to its users.</p>
<p>A byproduct if this vector is that is that results are catastrophic for the site owners. While in a case of common defacement attacks restoring (or recreating) the homepage is all it required to get back to business, in this case the whole database is ruined. Considering the scope of the attack and that restoring the database, if it was ever backup, requires much more expertise, the overall damage of this attack is very high.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>The Washington Post ran a story about a large scale infiltration to IPower, a major hosting provider.

Put in perspective the <a href="byid_id_2007-75.shtml">PlusNet incident</a> which was serious but swiftly handled and publicly acknowledged by the company.</p>
<p>Actually the problem is so dominant that a recent <a href="http://stopbadware.org">StopBadware</a> report lists Ipower as by far the most Malware infected hosting company. Reports mention that the problem started as early as mid 2006.
</p><p>The root cause of the breach here is mentioned as being a vulnerability in either Apache, PHP or cPanel. I have selected the third as being more probably until further evidence materialize.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Update (Dec 30th 2008)</span></em></p>
<p>It seems that the original report was not accurate and it was not a CSRF vulnerablity that was exploited. The mistake is reported by the victim in an imaginary <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/google-site-links-gmail-hack-search-penalty/">discussion with Google</a> blog post (Search the page for XSRF) and by <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html">Google</a>. Google hints that it was a phishing attack, but David Airey is <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/google-gmail-phishing-scam/">not convinced</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many times we dismiss seemingly minor vulnerabilities in major web sites. Most notably, "yet another" XSS or CSRF vulnerability in a well known service is not considered news anymore. However the following story proves that no matter what, such vulnerabilities cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The attack is simple, the result pretty frightening. An attacker, presumably Iranian, stole the domain name of David Airey, a graphic artist and a known blogger. The attack was very well timed with David's leaving to a long vacation. The goal was to extort money in order to return the domain. In David's case there is a happy end, as the attention he got helped him receive his blog back, with some loss in traffic, search engine ranking and time. But other victims of the attacker who steal domains for living may not be as fortunate.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Just like <a href="byid.php?id=2007-60">WHID 2007-60</a>, this hack is probably a representative of many other incidents. The Indonesian hacker Hmei7 has left the message "Hmei7 has touched your soul" on the Web site of the police department in Tucson, Arizona. Only unlike regular defacement, this time it is not the front page but rather the news section that was modified.</p>
<p>As many you know, the news section is one of the few database driven parts in many mostly static sites, as it allows the site owner to add news without requiring  a web designer. Therefore it came as no surprise that the attack was identified by a public source as an SQL injection attack.</p>

<b>Date Occured:</b> 12/19/2007<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> Process Automation<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>Use of robots and automated software against a web site, as long as it is not done in order to break into the site, falls into a grey area. While hard to classify as an unlawful act, it is usually harmful to the site owner and possibly to the site users. Apart from using valuable resources, such an automated access may breach the site's usage license of public information and might also indicate unlawful activity such as using a botnet. Many times it is hard to know if such a blast of requests is a denial of service attack, brute force password cracking or just a search engine crawler.</p>
<p>Going forward we are going to add such incidents to WHID if there is a reason to believe that they are not friendly, even if the actual goal of the attack cannot be easily classified. The Facebook case at hand is a perfect example: while the details are not clear, the fact that Facebook filed a law suit implies that there is fire behind the smoke.</p>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>This story probably represents hundreds of similar stories. Many of us have come to rely on open source software, which is useful, feature reach and free. It enables us access to tools available to a few only a couple of years ago. The downside is that this easy availability means that many use the tools without having the time, resources and expertise to protect them. Systems such as <a href="http://www.phpbb.com">phpBB</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> are good<br>examples of very popular open source systems that require constant<br>attention in order to maintain secure.</p>
<p>I am sure that the guys at Light Blue Touchpaper have the expertise to protect their WordPress installation, but they dont have the time. They made the compromise between ease of management of their web site and its security. Actually my <a href="http://blog.shezaf.com">personal blog</a> might be just as vulnerable, since as I write this I am very much not paying attention to its security.</p>
<p>Apart from, or actually because of  the fact that the victims are security experts, this story is noteworthy due to two additional twists in the plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero day exploit in the wild - the attacker penetrated twice, once using a known SQL injection vulnerability, but the second time using a yet unknown vulnerability in WordPress, which was reverse engineered and published for the first time by the people at Light Blue Touchpaper.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The researchers found that they can use Google to retrieve the hashed password of the hacker. Google has become so big that it actually allows efficient encrypted passwords lookup.</li>
<p>

But this time it is the site of a security organization, and not just any one, but China's internet security organization. So in the light of the hot debate about china as the source of all hacking, we think that this story has a value.

<b>Attack Method:</b> Redirection<br>

<b>Outcome:</b> Link Spam<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Internet<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> Global<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>While most WHID entries are about web site breaches, sometimes vulnerability in a web application is used indirectly. Redirection functions in web applications are commonly used by spammers and phishers. It allows them to include a honest looking URL in their e-mail, this way bypassing spam filters and observant users.</p>
<p>Symantec response team found actively used alternative in the best known page on the internet: Google primary search page. By using the Google famous "I feel lucky" feature, the spammer can automatically lead the victim to the first result of a search. All the spammer is left with is finding a query for which his site would pop up first on Google.</p>
<p>This method has another advantage over a redirection page, as the final target is specified by a search string and not by a URL, bypassing smarter filters that know, or learn, that a URL as a parameter of a URL is most probably redirection.</p>

<b>WHID ID:</b> 2007-42<br>

<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Finance<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> India<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>This very serious hacking incident provides insight into a lot<br>of the failures information security in general and web application<br>security particularly beyond the simple fact that the web site of the<br>largest state owned bank in India was invisibly defaced with Trojan<br>inflicting code.</p>
<p>Firstly, the entire discussion in the references is about the<br>Trojan payload, with no word about the vulnerability that led to the<br>defacement. Actually a reviewer on the SiteAdvisor report gives the<br>green mark to the web site after the Trojan is removed, without<br>requiring any information about the actual problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, most trust systems, including SiteAdvisor,<br>completely fail to detect the breach. Which makes me think about those<br>trust models: they check that the site was not breached, while they<br>should check that the site is not vulnerable. I guess the reason is<br>that their primary goal is to detect intentionally malicious sites and<br>not breaches is normative sites, but others use them to assess the<br>level of security of the later.<br></p>

I included this one since the attacked web site is significant, and since it emphasizes what is becoming a major goal of attacking: politics and international affairs. <br>As a side note, this incident is also interesting because it was repeated after discovered and presumably fixed, which goes a long way to show how much effort there is in protecting web sites and how difficult it cab be.

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>The CNBC stock trading reality TV show was even more real than contenders thought it would be.

</p><p><br>The interesting anecdote is that the person who discovered the issue has used a different, but also questionable technique of maintaining a very large number of portfolios automatically managed by automated programs using the fact that the game allowed a user to have any number of portfolios but only the best one is counted.

<b>WHID ID:</b> 2007-12<br>

<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>While vulnerabilities in public web sites are dime a dozen this days and rarely included in WHID, a classic SQL injection in the login form on the home page of the web site of a very big company is worth an entry. In my presentation I usually claim that such vulnerabilities have disappeared years ago and then go on to show advanced SQL injection techniques. It seems that they exit.

<p></p><hr>
An SQL injection vulnerability that could result in a hacker being able to access credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes of thousands of consumers was discovered in the web site of retailer "life is good".
<p>The US Federal Trade Commission charged "life is good" with lack of reasonable and appropriate security for the sensitive consumer information stored on its servers. The company's settlement with the company requires the company to accept a very comprehensive and costly security procedure going forward.</p>

<b>WHID ID:</b> 2005-65<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 2/17/2008<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> Process Automation<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Insufficient Anti-automation<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Leakage of Information<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Information Services<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> USA<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p>The LexisNexis data breach is not new, but we have recently decided to <a>start tracking</a> abuse of insufficient automation measures and are adding historical incidents.</p>
<p>In this incident a group of people opened accounts at data broker LexisNexis and used automated tools to extract a large amount of personal information provided by the service.</p>
<p>As usual in such cases there is a question of whether the attack was a criminal activity, violation of the license agreement of the information provider or plainly legal. In this regard it is interesting to note that the group arrested in the incident was also responsible for the hacking to <a href="http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2005-5.shtml">Paris Hilton Vodafone account</a>, which was clearly an unlawful act.
</p><p>Back in 2005 this data breach was one of the first such incidents, generated a lot of media interest, and led to more regulation regarding information aggregators. Interestingly, the excuse given by the company was that the incident was that there was no security failure in the web site, but that the procedures where lacking. We accepted this story at the time, but today we believe that such automation and scraping attacks are among the most dangerous attacks.</p>

</p><p><br>The site was taken off line for 10 hours to fix the issue. It is a significant incident, as it is one of those rare occasions where vulnerability was serious enough to force the organization to just take the site off line until it is fixed.

<b>Entry Title:</b> WHID 2004-17: The CardSystems breach was an SQL Injection hack (Updated)<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> 2004-17<br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 4/20/2006<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> SQL Injection<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Input Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Credit Card Leakage<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Finance<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> <br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> <p><em><strong>Update (May 27th 2009)</strong></em> - The CardSystems incident is refusing to die. Merrick Back is now <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/05/26/Merrick.pdf">suing Savvis</a> for certifying CardSystems as CISP compliant while it systems where wide open. CISP is a VISA program for certifying credit card processing systems which existed prior to PCI DSS.</p>
<p>The actual damage to an organization of an attack is rarely disclosed, and coverage focuses on the Number_of_Records stolen. In the court documents Merrick reveals that its own damage from the CardSystems incident was $16,000,000! The money was paid to card holders to compensate for losses and for legal fees and fines.</p>
<p>The case is also interesting as it put to test the liability of the certifying entity (in this case Savvis) resulting from assessing. The results may have profound influence on the PCI QSA market and therefore PCI itself. David Navetta posts an <a href="http://infoseccompliance.com/2009/06/03/merrick-bank-v-savvis-analysis-of-the-merrick-bank-complaint/">excellent legal analysis</a> of the potential implications of the lawsuit.</p>
<hr>
<p>This entry is a very important one. Most are already familiar with the infamous CardSystems incident where hackers stole 263,000 credit card numbers, exposed 40 million more and several million dollars fraudulent credit and debit card purchases had been made with these counterfeit cards. As a result of the breach CardSystems nearly went out of business and was eventually purchased by PayByTouch. CardSystems is considered by many the most severe publicized information security breach ever and it caused company share holders, financial institutes and card holders damage of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>But since the publication of the incident a year ago the way in which the breach occurred remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Recently new articles about the case (listed below) revealed that SQL injection was used by the attackers to install malicious script on the CardSystems web application database which where scheduled to run every four days, extract records, zip them and export them to an FTP site.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stunning examples where a web application security hole was used to launch a targeted attack in order to steal money.</p>

<b>Entry Title:</b> Conservative party web CMS system hacked<br>
<b>WHID ID:</b> <br>
<b>Date Occured:</b> 10/16/2010<br>
<b>Attack Method:</b> SQL Injection<br>
<b>Application Weakness:</b> Improper Input Handling<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> Defacement<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Field:</b> Politics<br>
<b>Attacked Entity Geography:</b> United Kingdom<br>
<b>Incident Description:</b> SQL injection flaw in CMS system allowed admin access to many smaller individual and regional Conservative party web sites (the main site www.conservatives.com was unaffected). The password field for the CMS login page was susceptible to a SQL injection attack allowing access to arbitrary user accounts including the CMS administrator account.

The CMS controlled content access to the content of a number of sites run by the Conservative party, many of which are used by regional party groups. The websites have remained down since the attack, including:

http://www.bathconservatives.com/
http://www.newtonabbotconservatives.org.uk/
http://www.nwdurhamconservatives.com/
http://www.nwnorfolkconservatives.com/

Details of the flaw were posted on several message boards and rapid and widespread defacement occured, ranging from political satire to hate speak.<br>
