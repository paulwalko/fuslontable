<b>CInfo5:</b> The Career Exploration Internship course is a paid or unpaid work experience in the public or private sector that provides for workplace learning in an area of student career interest. Unlike a cooperative education program where students gain expertise in a specific occupation, the career exploration internship is intended to expose students to broad aspects of a particular industry of career cluster area by rotating through various departments. In addition to their workplace learning activities, students participate in 1) regularly scheduled meetings with their classroom teacher, or 2) a regularly scheduled seminar with the teacher, for the purpose of helping the student make the connection between academic learning and their work-related experiences. Specific instructional objectives for the internship must be written to clarify the expectations of all parties – the student, the parent, employer, and instructor.

Work ethics, including promptness, attendance, team skills, loyalty, etc. will be emphasized. Students will be permitted to leave school to go to work for two blocks every other day. Students will meet with the career start teacher once every two weeks for discussion and skill building. Employers must be pre-approved. To qualify, a student must be eligible for a work permit and must have a satisfactory attendance and discipline record. Employers must agree to regular evaluation of students and constant communication with the school. This program is not to be confused with Interdisciplinary Cooperative Education (ICE) which is a selective vocationally approved senior level class. Career Start is a stepping stone to the ICE Program.

<b>CInfo3:</b> 1 semester, 1 credit<br>
<b>CInfo4:</b> Recommended Prerequisite: Algebra II or concurrent enrollment in Algebra II<br>
<b>CInfo5:</b> College-Entrance Preparation utilizes individual student score reports from the PSAT and/or the PLAN to prepare students for the SAT, ACT, the Accuplacer and Compass assessments.  Based on these score reports, students will receive targeted instruction to strengthen their foundations in critical reading, writing, mathematics, and science (all sections of college admission and placement exams).  As appropriate, the course will also encompass test taking strategies to prepare students for success on a high-stakes assessment. Teachers are encouraged to use a curriculum with longitudinal, successful results. Course may also include college selection and application units, to best prepare students for overall college-readiness.  Being “college ready” means being prepared for any postsecondary education or training experience, including study at two- and four-year institutions leading to a postsecondary credential (i.e., a certificate, license, Associate’s or Bachelor’s degree). Being ready for college means that a high school graduate has the English and mathematics knowledge and skills necessary to qualify for and succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing college courses without the need for remedial coursework.

Five critical areas comprise Algebra I: Relations and Functions; Linear Equations and Inequalities; Quadratic and Nonlinear Equations; Systems of Equations and Inequalities; and Polynomial Expressions. The critical areas deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.

<b>CInfo5:</b> ACP Biology is a course offered in conjunction with Indiana University.  It is a college course designed to examine the fundamental principles of Biology.  ACP Biology expands the information presented in Biology I, and reinforces and builds on the principles of biological organization from molecules through cells and organisms.  The emphasis is on processes common to all organisms, with special reference to humans.  This course may be taken for college credit as well as high school credit (see Guidance Department for details).  If taken for college credit, it counts as a 5-credit hour lab course for non-science majors, or as a 5-credit hour elective to prepare science majors for more advanced courses.  The official I.U. course title is L100 – Humans and the Biological World.  This course is different from AP Biology.  AP Biology is a course based on the curriculum created by the Advanced Placement division of the College Board.  This curriculum is a very strict and complete overview of biological concepts.  It is much more wide-ranged and in-depth than even an actual college course.  This course will, however, help to prepare you to take the AP Exam.  Students who take the AP Exam in May, and who pass with a 4 or 5 on a 5 point scale, can be eligible to skip the first year required course of Biology in many colleges.  The required score (or even if the program is accepted) varies from university to university.  Each student should check with the specific colleges they wish to apply for.  If your chosen college accepts IU transfer credit, it is much more beneficial for you to take the course for ACP credit (which is offered at a significant discount).  Students taking the course for ACP credit, and students who are applying to colleges that do not recognize the AP program, should not take the AP Exam in May.  All other students are encouraged to take the AP Exam, but it is not required.
