<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The "droning engine" descriptions fits it pretty well. It sounds like a very distant idling vehicle, but there is also a vibratory aspect to it....akin to hearing the bass from loud music that's been muffled by distance and walls. Also like when you can hear/feel the bass from stereo systems in other people's cars.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I have heard this sound for almost three days. At first I thought it was a car or home stereo with a lot of bass power but, it has persisted for about 60 hours now. I live in a rural area without many close residences so, I took a couple of walks in an attempt to locate the source of the sound. No matter what direction I go or how far, the noise does not change. The sound is not a smooth or constant sound. As I stated above it sounds like bass music.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very low frequency Diesel engine like throbbing sound. Sometimes it drones on for long stretches before it has a short pause / throb, then picks up again, repeating the rhythm.  Sometimes the droning / throb rhythm speeds up slightly and other times it has irregular quick throbs, similar to irregular heart beats.
Can't block it out even when plugging ears; therefore it appears to be sensed by the body, which interprets it as sound. Only hear it / sense it inside enclosures; in house, parked car in driveway and partially outdoors when under carport, which has ceiling but open on 2 sides.
Worse between 10 pm and 7am when all other external noises (e.g. traffic) are not or less present.  Wakes me up middle of night when loudest between 2am and 3:30am and it's difficult to get back to sleep, if at all.  Have heard it at other places I have visited.  Within my very close group of family / acquaintances, which are about 13 people, only 3 can hear / sense it and 1 can only sense it.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> During full moon phases it seems to be quieter in the early hours of the evening, but still loud in the middle of the night.  When it rains it seems to be less intense or not present. 
Just started hearing it in late August 2012, shortly  after a drought and very hot temperatures in my area, so not sure if it is more prevalent during colder months until I get through a full year's cycle.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Varies a lot<br>

<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> Left ear<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> I am located in the Niagara escarpment area, which is vey hilly, very gravelly / sandy and there are lots of underground and above ground rivers / creeks. 
I am in Caledon Village, Ontario,  Canada' which is 485 meteres above sea level.
My ears pop every day due to elevation changes when going to / from work ( just kike in airplanes).
There are multiple gravel pits within 1 - 5 miles, which have created mini lakes due to gravel / sand extraction.
I am about 30 miles away (south / east) from windmills in Melanchthon, Ontario, Canada.
There are no new cell towers.
I am in a small subdivision surrounded by rural / farming and a green belt.
We are on septic tanks and are on town water. Have gas (stove, fireplace, pool heater, dryer).  Some neighbours are still on well water.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Ambidextrous (can use both well)<br>

Newmarket, Ontario, Canada

Have added above to map.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No.
I've had issues in the past hearing very deep voices, such as my husband when he speaks quietly. 
Therefore it's surprising I can hear / sense this very low frequency hum sound and my husband can't.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> The following questions may be applicable:
1.  Have you had cancer? If so, what tpe and what treatment did you have?

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very subtle low frequency hum like a generator or diesel engine running in the distance.  Seems to grow and wane in intensity over time (weeks / months).

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> We have a cluster of huge feeder gas lines passing about 4 or 5 miles from my house.  It travels West-East accross the entire state of Mchigan and on into Canada where it crosses the border at Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. 

Also, northern Oakland County is the terminus of a glacial morraine from the last big glaciation period 13,000 years ago.  Its very hilly.  The surface is mostly rock sandy till dragged down from Canada.

Also, the part of Michigan I live in is at the bottom of the Michigan Basin -- formed when there used to be an ancient seabed here.  Its surrounded by ancient Domes on three sides: In Wisconsin, Ohio, and Southeastern Ontario.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low reasonance hum that is not explainable.  I thought was the extractor fan or tv/computer vibrating against the wall in the flat downstairs (I'm top floor in a block of 6).  It's not constant - the description of a distant diesel lorry with engine problems is exactly right.

My whole bed seems to resonate with the noise and earplugs do nothing to help.  Nobody else can hear it.  It's not audible when I go to bed around 11pm, but by 2am every night I'm awake and being driven mad by it.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I only hear it from around 2am to 7am.  I live near Heathrow airport so when the planes start flying around 5.30am it's a blessed relief.  Most people complain about the plane noise, but not me!!

I've tried unplugging every electrical item in the flat - but to no avail.  The sound doesn't seem audible outside.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Sounds like a diesel engine running in the area - sometimes sounds distant, other times nearby. NOT an electrical noise because the "power" company AND an electrical company have come to check the noise - which they could not hear. Sometimes it has the same sound you would get if you blew across a wide mouth bottle (do not misread that as a jar, but a bottle)<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> NO! Sometimes it isn't as loud. I appreciate the warm weather that requires air conditioning because I can put a window unit in my central air home and that masks/blends the HUM to a level that it can only be discerned but not disorienting.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low frequency tone rough match from the piano -not quite D# or Eb which equates to approximately 41 or 82 Hz, hard to distinguish which.  First heard on July 28th 2004. Initially sounded like a diesel truck, but later like an electrical drone.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Wednesday 24th January 2005, Australia Day. 7.01 am No hum. Then very faint until 8 am when it was loud again.

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Two places are involved, one north west of the town, had a disused high grade iron ore mine approx half km away. The house was situated towards the bottom of a small hill, leading to a low lying area of reclaimed swamp. Mixture of red clay, serpentine and sandy soil.  Area undergoing massive infrastructure changes within 400 metres. 

The second place is south of town, 600ms from the beach. The hum is less intrusive here and generally without physical effects. Sounds more electrical. The 207Hz on tone generator nullifies the hum.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Not sure<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> this sound is felt as well as heard, and can change from sounding like a transformer attached to your house, a diesel train just sitting and idling right under your bedroom window, a combination of a ring along with sound of very loud bees swarming, or just the bee sound alone, or ring at all different levels alone. The diesel sound is very low and is felt so strongly that ice packs are needed on my head area. All these sounds carry a vibration, especially felt if in bed. Sometimes these different sounds can start up abruptly, go on for days at intolerable sound levels, and stop abruptly, only to start up again within a very short time period. 
Weather definitely plays a part, and different phases of the moon or tides.
Aproximately 4 days before a full or new moon, the sounds and vibrations become louder, during it and about 2 days after. 
These sounds can feel and sound like it fills the entire house. 
Sometimes the buzzing sounds are so loud while driving, they actually override the highway sounds of trucks etc. going by.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> yes, the sounds can and do stop, but very infrequently, with a 24 hr., 7 days a week the norm.<br>

brain tumor removal
stomach complaints
blocked bile duct
symptoms of Vibroacoustic disease without any signs of depression; still love life in spite of the biggest complaint....SLEEP DEPRIVATION
Also have an eardrum that will not close up anymore; 
(note, I have tried different noise cancellations including the latest Bose Headset, and cannot tell if they are turned on or off because this noise is so all permeating)<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> had auditory training twice, and finally purchased an Auditory Training set to have in my own home.....very little to no improvement.

ice packs around my head/temples and wearing my hearing aids on the 1st setting or phone setting works somewhat, along with several purifiers and fans going...my room sounds like a factory, and still at times when the sound is at its loudest, they cannot cover the extreme frequencies, whether high or low. 

I seem to sleep better when the morning rush hours starts, as there is an all over white noise effect....up most nights, and cannot drive long without having to deal with the vibrations going through my whole body which is very tiring and drains me. I also feel blocked in the chest if drive is past 1/2 hour. This is partly due to other traffic noise, as driving back at night seems to work when there is little traffic on the road. 
I have been constantly told I have Tinnitus, but this is much worse.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> The loudest that I've ever heard the hum was in 2005, on the mountains behind where I live in Marbella in Spain. It was so loud and clear that the non hearers that I was with could easily detect the sound. When I asked them to describe the noise they all responded in agreement, "It sounds like a large diesel engine idling in the distance". Also in 2007 on the North Shore in Auckland New Zealand, where I was sat at a large table which vibrated at the same frequency as the hum. I was able to feel the table vibrate through my fingers while simultaneously hearing the noise.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low frequency moaning with no repeating pattern for the most part. The diesel engine description fits only in the frequency, an engine would (does) have a more repeating sound.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Like I stated above, it's intensity changes at times, through the 90's it was very loud at times and seemed to change intensity over weeks from very loud then less intensity each week until negligible, then reverse and gain intensity for weeks until very loud again. As stated above the hum seemed gone for a long while after 9/11/2001.....I thought something in me had changed and I couldn't hear it any longer. After hoping it be gone for years I actually sort of missed it. It's been heard by me since then (last night even) but never at the intensity of the late 1990's. 

Below I will answer it's the upstairs where it's loudest but in actuality it's the same down stairs and inside a non running car but never outdoors.<br>

Hope someone can crack this one day before we crack

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very low frequency oscillating hum. It often reminds me of what a cell phone sounds like when placed near a speaker at just the ring angle. The start-stop oscillations of communicating with the cell tower is very similar. However, at times, it will be constant and steady for minutes at-a-time. It sounds like a 60hz tone in my head, very fast, constant at times, short burst at other times. Always very low, though.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes. It varies in intensity on a seemingly random schedule. I have gone weeks without noticing it, but when I do notice it; it is overbearing. I cannot tell if it is seasonal, but I can say that I have noticed it more intensely during the winter months.<br>

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> There is a cell tower within 1 mile of my home. There is a fairly large high power complex about 3 miles from my home. When I stand in front of the cell towers, I can hear the hum but it is similar to in my home or standing outside of my home. So it seems inconclusive, even though the hum seems to mimic cellular activity. When I stand in front of the high power complex, the hum is deafening and feels as though it pulses against my eardrums. I can easily hear it over the sparking, crackling of the high tension power lines overhead.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A deep throbbing rumble like an idling diesel engine. Until I heard about this phenomenon called "The Hum", I didn't realise that other people heard this too. I thought that maybe a truck driver somewhere in the valley was warming up his engine for ages. My husband doesn't hear anything, but it sometimes keeps me from sleeping. Often the sound is also a vibration sensation in my chest and stomach. It is stronger when my head is on the pillow on either side, not so strong when on my back.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound is noticed sometimes when I try to sleep about midnight. On occasions it has stopped between half an hour and one hour later, as if an engine has been turned off. Other times it carries on until I go to sleep with some difficulty<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Between once and twice per second<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>

<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Not sure<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> My house is halfway up the hill in a long steep valley, in a country and city on seismic faultlines. When an earthquake is approaching at night time, I also hear it as a very deep rumble, before the shaking starts. The sound of earthquakes and the hum constant rumble are similar, and so it is hard to avoid feeling anxious when I hear them.<br>

Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> The hum is steady and constant, but will immediately disappear if I make ambient noise (such as rolling over in bed, talk to someone, etc.).  It's as though a sound like turning/talking cancels out the hum completely.  However, as soon as I lie still and stop moving, or stop talking, the sound resumes immediately.  I can only hear it inside my house, but can also hear it in my neighbour's house (we are semi-detached).  No one else can hear it but me.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum is omnidirectional and definitely external as I can hear other sounds as well (ie: tv, birds, wind, people talking etc, if it was tinnitus my hearing would be blocked and I wouldn't hear other ambient sounds), it sounds like an idling diesel engine or helicopter is in the near distance and differs in intensity or 'volume'. Volume not in the sense of sound waves per se, but as in a vibrational frequency. I can cover my ears and put the pillow over my head but it makes no difference. The ELF is amplified inside the house but I can still detect it outside the house.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> As of today, 10 Jan 2013, I have been hearing the hum since early Feb 2011. I have been recording the times and dates of hearing the hum since March 2011. It used to come and go randomly with no pattern, either for a few days only late at night or a few weeks late at night but for the past four weeks it has been almost continuous day and night with varying levels of intensity. It isn't stopping, hence my motivation to go online yet again to research it and I found your website.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house main floor<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2011<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> Feb 2011<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Auckland is sitting on an Isthmus - meaning we are a harbour city, on a narrow neck of the main North Island where it is a short distance between the west and east coasts.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 41<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Sleep disturbances, dizziness when very intense<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> <br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I have racked my brains trying to figure out the source/cause of the ELF. These are my options:
1. Volcanic activity (NZ has a lot of volcanoes either active, reawakening or dormant)
2. Electromagnetic Pollution (the hum has been so random with no pattern and quiet for extended periods of time that I have more or less ruled this out)
3. Man made radar or related type technology that has not been made public. For example HAARP etc, black technology being used. I have researched this and there are many 'Research' projects which makes this the most likely scenario. Possibly the following 'AARDDVARK' project?

The Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic) Deposition - VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortium (AARDDVARK) provides continuous long-range observations of the lower-ionosphere. The Konsortia sensors detect changes in ionisation levels from ~30-85 km altitude, with the goal of increasing the understanding of energy coupling between the Earth's atmosphere, Sun, and Space. We use the upper atmosphere as a gigantic energetic particle detector to observe and understand changing energy flows; this Science area impacts our knowledge of global change, communications, and navigation. The joint NZ-UK Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic) Deposition - VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortia (AARDDVARK) is a new extension of a well-establish experimental technique, allowing long-range probing of ionisation changes at comparatively low altitudes. Most other instruments which can probe the same altitudes are limited to essentially overhead measurements. At this stage AARDDVARK is essentially unique, as similar systems are only deployed at a regional level.<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I believe this HUM is government related.  They are using Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) for experiments and communication.

ELF radio waves are generated by lightning and natural disturbances in Earth's magnetic field, so they are a subject of research by atmospheric scientists. Because of the difficulty of building transmitters that can generate such long waves, ELF frequencies have been used in only a very few manmade communication systems. ELF waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of several hundred feet, so the US and Russian military have used ELF transmission facilities to communicate with their submerged submarines. The frequency of alternating current flowing in electric power grids, 50 or 60 Hz, falls within this frequency band, and power grids are an unintentional source of ELF radiation.

HAARP is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I have been referring to this sound as a bass noise.  It sounds as though the neighbors have their bass cranked up.  It typically follows a mmmmmm mmm mmm mmmmmmm pattern.  It can become so loud that it resonates through my ears.  I first noticed it at home but have also noticed the hum at work.  For instance today I had to just leave because it was just that loud, and NOBODY could hear it.  It's ironic that something could be so unbelievably loud to one person and another can't even hear it.  I thought I was going nuts!  I usually only hear it at work after my students have left for the day (I am a teacher).  During the school day I must be too busy and with the hustle and bustle of the students I do not notice it.  At home I must run a fan to block out the noise.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The hum is at complete random.  At times it is completely quiet and can be for hours.  But then low and behold, there it is!<br>

I started hearing it almost immediately when I arrived in Australia, and it continued until I came home to the U.S. almost 4 months later. I never heard it before that period, and I haven't heard it since. Additionally, while I was in Melbourne, I experienced horrible, daily vertigo and migraine headaches. The vertigo alone was so bad that I could barely walk, and doctors in Australia were testing me for Multiple Sclerosis. However, these neurological problems stopped within two weeks of my return to the U.S.<br>

Suggestion, to add Anxiety to "Medical complaints from The Hum", 
although it's a psychological complaint usue.
Maybe it is possible to integrate a tone generator on this side to easily compare.

The Hum had been on puplic scope in Germany in the late summer of 2001.
There had been several announcements of investigations, 
but results never have been covered by the media, if there were any.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Its a pulsing hum that varies in its volume. Sometimes its so strong that I feel it vibrating my body. For me it sounds similar to the 50Hz humming of electricity
with different breaks. Sometimes it happens that I wake up in the early morning from the vibrating, then the humming stops and I feel like falling untill it starts after 0.5 to 1 sec again.<br>

for the humming varies a lot e.g. sometimes it is pulsing, sometimes it is more or less a durating tone. Also the tone-colour of the hum varies from rough to almost tranquilizing.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Noise of large engine (Diesel Rig) idling engine, or the sound of train in distance over railroad tracks. However, I step outside of the home, and never hear neither. It is important to note, that a train tracks run north-south 1 mile from my home, and when it passes, I step outside, and hear it very, very clearly with no doubt or speculation that what I am hearing is train passing by.

The hum pulsates, the sound frequency almost alternates, audibly shifting frequency, or pitch...as well a change in intensity,,,,<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Recently I discovered that the sound seems loudest in my basement. One may think the lack of, or diminished, less exterior sound, tinnitus, thought watching the Superbowl tonight, I could hear it on the main level of the home, in the same room of our Theatre Sound System with the sound level moderately loud.Additionally, roughly a week ago, I discovered even something more odd. Why the sound was bothering late at night, and more than normal while in the basement, in the basement is an unfinished area, there is a particular corner that is offset/recessed solid concrete. When I stand up, closely in the corner, the hum 100% vanishes...<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> Never. Doctors jump to conclusions, to avoid this, this past year, I noted to my doctor I was having issues hearing (I wasn't)  clearly at various time, and asked if he (or nurse) could conduct a quick hearing test. My hearing came back as slightly "above" average as I could hear high frequency slightly better than average.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> That's about it, besides I sense whatever this noise is, there is an explanation. 

Has anyone researched our suggestion this could somehow be generated by Cell Phone Towers?

Look at the data at home many towers have went up world wide in the past 2-3 years (especially in the US) , and how much has the "hum" has spiked (from the aspects of reporting)  in the same amount of time......<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low droning hum--obviously--that persists most in my right ear.
What I mean by this is that I can sometimes hear it in both ears, but I always hear it in my right ear when it happens, without fail.
I don't recall ever hearing it throughout the day, it only seems to begin at night, often as I'm trying to fall asleep. I usually start to notice it after lying in bed for a few minutes. 
It's quite annoying. Not painful, but it certainly does like to keep me awake.
Now, I have slight tinnitus too, but I've long since gotten used to that, as I've had it for as long as I can remember. I learned to almost completely ignore that a while ago. 
This 'humming' is very different from the tinnitus 'whining' or 'ringing'. I've been able to shut the tinnitus noises out by concentrating very hard on something, like creating a story in my mind, or working on a drawing. Doing challenging homework works, too. However, very rarely have my tried-and-true tactics worked to shut out the hum.
It's not really that loud, it's just so constant and persistent and unusual that it really gets to me.
I'd really like to have an explanation for it, but I understand that a true cause hasn't been found yet.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound seems to persist until I fall asleep. I usually feel myself drifting off to sleep around 11:30 or 12:00 every night. Sometimes later, sometimes earlier. Later, around 1:00 or 3:00 in the morning, I usually wake up again for a few minutes to about a half hour. I don't know why, I just do. Sometimes I still hear the Hum then, other times I don't. I'd say it's about 50-50. 
By the time my alarm wakes me up again at 5:40, I don't hear the Hum anymore.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Varies a lot<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house main floor<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2010<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> <br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> right ear<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> I don't think there are any.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 14<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Irritability<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> Nova Scotia<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> I have tinnitus, but I've learned to ignore it so it doesn't affect my life anymore.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I myself haven't heard the Hum in Nova Scotia. I put that entry in because my parents went on vacation to Nova Scotia I while ago, and upon learning about the Hum online just last year, I realized it matched the weird accounts they gave me about their time there. 
Apparently, they were on vacation somewhere in Nova Scotia--they aren't here right now for me to get confirmation on where exactly in NS they were--and they stayed at this cottage near the beach. They could hear a strange low droning hum in the area surrounding the cottage, if they concentrated hard on it, and they could hear it in the cottage itself more easily. Apparently, it was strongest in the bathroom. 
Upon entering the bathroom, both my parents report feeling a powerful force seeming to pull them down towards the floor, almost magnetically, as they described it, and they felt dizzy, too. Coupled with the strange force was a much louder Hum that seemed to begin beneath them and then rise up from the floor until the noise was all around them.
The most curious thing about this scenario, in my opinion, is how the Hum's increase in volume seemed to tie in to the powerful pull towards the floor. It was so unusually strong that my mom was frightened by it, and refused to use the toilet or take a shower in that bathroom. (She visited a nearby friend's house to do so.) My dad was more stoic about it. 
They said that they'd like to go back there someday to experience it again, just because it was so unnatural. I'd like to go there too, because it sounds so utterly incredible.
That's about all I have on the Hum. I hope my information can be helpful.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Little Rock is very hilly.  I have heard this noise only since moving here.  It has always sounded like highway traffic over the next hill, even though the highway is a mile, and several hills, away.  Directionally, it sounds like it comes from the highway, but I only notice it indoors and may make that association.  The Arkansas river runs through town, but I have never felt that the hum came from that direction.  I did notice this morning that there was no wind outside while hearing the hum.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It is generally a steady, low frequency hum, although not extremely low. It does not discriminate between day and night. It does not pulsate. A large, municipal water tank is about 1/10th of a mile up the street as well as a cell phone tower right next to it. There are emergency generators in place for that infrastructure but they are not running when the hum is audible. I have heard them run and they are not part of the hum. There is no heavy equipment running nearby when the hum is audible. I have turned the main circuit breaker off in my house to eliminate all electrical possibilities, but the hum persists. I hear it inside and outside my house as well as up the street. My wife cannot hear the hum.<br>

Stood out on the front porch the back porch during the daytime and in the middle of the night. Never have heard this before! First few nights that I started hearing it , I could not sleep AT ALL!! Now I hear it but will finally fall asleep, but will wake up in middle of night and can hear it again and pray I can fall back to sleep. So aggravating, but wish that my boyfriend could hear it so I didn't feel like I was losing my mind.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Similar to a noise of a working large aircraft blade propeller. The frequency is low and consistent. The amplitude changes but always to the same max and min level. The raise and fall in amplitude is very rapid. This rapid fall and raise in amplitude causes the noise to appear "broken". The breaks/pauses are very short making the sound to appear some times 2 to 3 times per second. The "breaks" are much shorter than the active parts. The longest "unbroken" sound duration (active part) is about few seconds. The noise thus appear pulsating with very uneven pulse.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I don't know. I am home only evenings, and nights during the week, and all day and night on weekends. There are a lot of sounds during the day and I don't or can't notice it. So it is noticeable only during the night. I went a few times out of the house to check if it is coming from the outside, but it seems like it is less noticeable there.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum as it starts sounds like some sort of large machine that is radiating sound. It gets louder then quieter, then louder and then quieter and continues the same pattern for a while before changing. The best analogy I can think of, is when another person has a ball on a string and is spinning it around really fast.When the ball is close to you, it sounds louder and when it further away it's a softer sound as it travels through the air. It is slow at first and begins to get louder over time. Also, the sound is very deep, like a bass in a stereo. It's not sharp, but instead a very soft pulsating hum. 

After the initial radiating hum pattern, it gets much louder and faster. It stays the same pitch however. Eventually, It sounds like a truck parked outside idling it's engine. But the location of the sound is impossible to find. Louder in some rooms than in others, and I can't help but feel the sound is coming from 'up' or in the air. When I open windows it does seem like the sound is coming from outside, but when I go out there, I literally have no idea where it could be located.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, the sound does stop. It always seems to last for around 10 minutes and continues to linger for a while thereafter. The initial 10 minute period is where the sound, to me, is unbearable. The sound kind of 'ramps down' in a steady decline until it is barely audible and then vanishes altogether. The entire process seems to take around a total of 15-20 minutes. Always at night, never during the day.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Around once per second on average<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2011<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> <br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Maine has a lot of mountains.<br>

<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 24<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> None at all.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I do want to add that if you have heard the noise, there will be no doubt in your mind. For me, it is unlike anything I've ever heard and it upsets my body on a physical level. Incredibly bizarre. If anyone is not sure if they have heard the hum, then they probably haven't. It is unmistakable. --I lived out in a small town, this is where I first heard the 'hum' about two years ago. It was about 3:00am when I heard it ( I remember because I checked the microwave for the time). It woke me from a dead sleep. I opened my window and looked outside, and saw nothing. The noise was SO loud. I went downstairs and searched the whole house because the sound was very irritating. I even went outside in the dead of night ( which I am very afraid to do because we are surrounded my woods and I am a total wuss.) I saw absolutely nothing. I felt like the sound was coming from 'up' but I could not pinpoint it. It was also a Full moon that night. I went back inside and paced my bedroom because I felt very annoyed and couldn't get back to sleep. The noise eventually faded and I went back to sleep. The whole episode lasted around 15 minutes. 

Portland ME, 04101- I now live in a city and while living here for 2 years I have been woken by the 'hum' four times. The most recent was actually last night at about 2:10am 2/12/2012. For me, there is always a 10 minute period of time where the sound is unbearable. I feel like it literally drives me nuts. Like nails scratching on a chalkboard. When I woke, I felt very hot just like previous occurrences. I also felt kind of sick in my stomach and had an adrenalin going--my heart was pumping pretty fast even though I was trying to breathe slowly. I felt so unbearably agitated. I really feel like something is being affected inside of me, it's a difficult feeling to describe, but I can feel this hum in my whole body. Every time this happens, I absolutely hate it. When the sound begins to fade, I start to feel better. And when it's gone completely, I feel suddenly very tired.

I thought I was crazy until my boyfriend also heard the sound. Both him and I woke in the middle of the night to hear that strange 'humming' sound. He was as upset as I, and he ran around the apartment checking appliances and electronics to no avail. The sound was loudest in our bedroom and quieter in other rooms. I felt somewhat validated in the fact that he was able to hear it too. He even tried earplugs--which did not work. This lasted for about 10 minutes and then faded.<br>

Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Is there a physiological component that suddenly, literally from one day/hour to the next, caused me to be capable of hearing something that was possibly present all along and that obviously cannot be heard by my partner or visitors? Why us who can hear it, and not others? Why now, and not before? Vitamin/mineral deficiency? Ear damage? Age, health,  gender, exposure to environmental / chemical factors? What is it that is physiologically different in us who hear it  from those who are blessedly ignorant of it? This is my question more that where it is coming from or why, I don't care because before Dcember 2010 IT DID NON EXIST FOR ME, although reported since many years ago by others, and now is ever present! I used to know what silence meant, now it is only briefly that I can enjoy total silence as before. How did we develop this sensitivity? I don't see anything in the web addressing from this perspective and it seems like it would afford more answers and solutions than all of the theories and ideas being put out there in the different blogs.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low frequency hum as if from a very large engine or engines the size of a train if it were idling near you.  It can oscillate in frequency slightly and increase/decrease in volume.  When turning my head to get a location of it sometimes it can disappear momentarily telling me it is almost imperceptible although it seems to be resonating very strongly from a place far away.  Low frequency is tricky like that.  It is somewhat hard to tell distance.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> As far as perception I work 40 miles from my house and do not hear it at work.  Competing sounds do make it stop momentarily.  As far as stopping from a known location it does stop.  I attributed it to just hearing things in the past.  About a year ago I heard it for a few weeks and then again in late December 2012.  I now hear it for the last three days quite strongly.<br>

I am not sure we are hearing it with our ears.  It is a resonating thing much like the feel of walking by a train engine that is at idle.  Although it doesn't shake you due to the VLF you don't hear it as much as you feel it.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Loud, constant, low frequency hum. Doesn't sound mechanical so much as it does electronic or electromagnetic, if that makes any sense. I hear it outside my apartment at night, often very loudly in the middle of the night in an otherwise quiet neighborhood. It sounds like its coming from everywhere, born of the air itself, with no discernible source or directionality to it. There are no cars or trucks idling, no planes, no inclement weather or obvious wind, and no obvious issues with pipes or other infrastructure. Notably, perhaps, I also experience cycles of low frequency vibration in this location every few weeks, also with no discernible cause. I've investigated possible sources both in and outside my building but can't seem to find a reason. I hae never felt it in other locations and I travel quite a lot, so I think it's safe to say its location-based.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It seems louder at night. I am not sure if it eer really goes away, though.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> This part of the st Louis inner suburbs apparently has a karst geography, with lots of caves. The sewage system is aging here and clearly overburdened, with lots of burst pipes, and I've heard some natural caves have been incorporated into the water system.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low continuous tone, about 24 Hz, louder in different parts of buildings, as if reinforced by standing waves within the room.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The hum seems to be loudest for a day or two before, and during the duration of cold weather in the northern US. Rarely detected during the summer months.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> <br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> Sept 1983<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> There is a Texas Eastern storage and transport pipeline system about 3/4 mile from my home, consisting of three 30 inch high pressure natural gas underground pipelines which run from the Gulf of Mexico to Cleveland OH, New York NY, and other northern metropoli. There is a booster compressor station about 10 miles downline. The hum seemed to be louder several years ago when the pipeline pressure was operated in excess of 50,000 PSI. The intensity of the hum is lower since several leaks and explosions promped the operators to reduce the pressure to 20.000 PSI or less. I did not notice the hum until the shell of my house was completed, at which time I began to detect the sound inside the structure. The ridge upon which my home and the pipeline are located have only a few inches to a couple feet of topsoil, on top of a solid limestone substrate. The foundation of the building in which the hum is loudest is directly connected to the bedrock with concrete pads.<br>

<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> Have not detected the hum in other cities, per se. I have detected the hum in other homes in this rural area that are located within a mile or so of the Texas Eastern pipeline.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> Slight high frequency tinnitus, aggrivated by exposure to the hum.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A faint humming in the ears accompanied by a feeling of pressure, agitation, and angst.  Experienced by 3 people simultaneously.  Animals appeared to be affected as well, showing angst and waking suddenly.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It seemed to vacillate in intensity but was nearly always present for a few hours.<br>

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Despite the fact that, according to reason, i should have dismissed it as tinnitus or some other natural phenomenon, I could not. It felt...menacing, or somehow unnatural. It continues as I type this.  I feel pressure all over my head, in my jaw, and a shakiness in my body, but not trembling from fear or cold.  It seems to be shaking everything.  When I recorded it with my phone it sounded different, more like white noise. The image recorded was odd, too. The video seems to pick up some visual vibrations in the form of red splotches moving about rapidly, similar in movement and size to tv static. 

So weird. I am not a conspiracy theorist or a religious nut.  I would not believe this if I had not experienced it myself.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Its like a 60hz (60 cycle electrical hum), that almost seems its in my inner ear. It lasts for hours sometimes.  Usually when quite.  White noise, background noise or other things, seems to help alleviate the sound a bit.  I have experienced this for years now, it was gone for about 5 years, now, its back.  My parents thought I was crazy, back when I lived with them... but now, my Mom says she hears it, too.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes.  During the day usually, when there is more hustle and bustle around for me to not notice.  And if I add any white noise or others drones, it helps make it "go away", but I know its stil there...<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No.  I have excellent hearing.  Near perfect pitch.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> When you ask of pulsation, it does some times.  But I feel that is mostly because of other soundwaves that may be interracting with it.  Sounds waves that are near the core frequency of the Hum.

I had not heard it for years... and I cant stand that its back.  It sound a lot stronger this time, but there is no mistake about it, its the same hum.  Again.  sigh.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Varies between no sound (electrical tingling) to pulsing hum, to constant hum.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, it used to last exactly one hour, eg. 4:15 am to 5:15 am, but now starts around 5 am and goes constantly for six or seven hours.  It gets worse every year.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Less than once per second on average<br>

<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> June 23, 2010, day of minor earthquake<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>

<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> Windsor, Ontario, Canada<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Yes, I believe it is a combination of HAARP and satellite rays and that we are being deliberately attacked by elite eugenicists (see the Georgia Guidestones).

Jesse Ventura discussed both HAARP and "Death Rays", see YouTube for proof they exist.

The satellite rays can be partially blocked with a copper mesh Faraday Cage or aluminum panels to a lesser extent.  Get rid of your spring mattress, it is like a giant antenna.  None of this protects against HAARP.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound occurs between 2:00 am and 3:00 am usually in the first few weeks of winter, and early spring. I have actually noticed it for the past 10 years of living here. I have investigated it before, but never thought to do research online about it. The sound seems to be that of a low flying plane, moving at a very slow speed. It tends to go on for up to 15 minutes, then fade out. The fact that it lasts so long has lead me to believe that that its something other than your average aircraft. I have also noticed that when the sound is occurring, it does not sound as prominent outside, as it does inside of a structure. From my current location I have an unobstructed view of of the horizon in all directions except north. I can see the surrounding cities quite well, Pomona, La Verne, San Dimas. I might also mention that the sound becomes so intense sometimes that it drowns out the sound of the light freeway traffic occurring so early in the morning. "I do live blocks away from the 210 freeway." The sound 100% has nothing to do with the freeway, because I have been near the freeway to investigate and it was coming from traffic, it was coming seemingly from above. After becoming convinced that it was not my imagination, I gathered some willing friends to stay up with me to see if they were able to hear it. And sure enough, so far, I've shared the experience with over 20 people. We have stood outside, to see nothing. We've also noticed that it tends to happen only on clear nights. And going back to the freeway investigation, as soon as the sound stops, the sound of the traffic will become audible again from my current location. The frequency of the sound is so low and constant that it also can create the feeling of a rumbling sensation. Again, I have quite a bit to say about this "hum" and am quite happy to find a group of others who are experiencing the same or similar situations.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, the sound tends to stop after about 15 to 20 minutes. Then, usually after about half an hour, it returns for the same amount of time. This also lead me to believe that it was an aircraft, but there's zero evidence of one.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house main floor<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2004<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> <br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> As I mentioned, I have a very good view of the surrounding cities. Claremont is at the foot of the Mount San Antonio mountain range, and all of the surrounding cities are lower in elevation. Directly to the north of the city lies Mt. Baldy, Ontario and Cucamonga Peak. On top of a smaller mountain called "Sunset Peak" there are a series of radio towers which I have visited, but other than that there is nothing unusual about the area. Perhaps the mountain range is reflecting frequencies from much farther away, perhaps from machinery? I don't know really. I am currently in school for a degree in Electronic and Radio Communications, and don't see how "as some have mentioned" the sound could be coming from transmission towers or high-voltage lines.<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Irritability, Sleep disturbances<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> La Verne, San Dimas, Pomona, Rancho Cucamonga, and Upland. I have been in these cities with the purpose of trying to hear the same sound.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> None.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I also live near the Claremont Colleges, and have started asking students if they would be interested in doing research on this bizarre situation, and many have said that they were interested, including some professors and researchers. It is fun to speculate what this sound could be, I would like to think that it's some man-made "secret" project, and if it is, it has really been illusive to us for some time now. For all I know it could be coming from underground as some people have mentioned. If I was to go all out on this issue, I'm sure I could get quite a few people to experience the "hum" as well. And one thing that I did forget to mention is that the sound does not happen every night, or even every week for that matter, it seems to happen on Tuesday and Thursday nights, perhaps only 5 times in early January, and early March. I do plan to pay more attention from now on, and perhaps keep a log of what I hear to be more accurate.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low pitch noise, sounds like a mains hum 50hz, but not the case as all power isolated at the consumer unit. Next door brought this my attention first and we thought she was slightly batty. She ended up moving out because of the noise. Now I can hear this at night when going to bed and It drives me crazy!! My girlfriend just laughs and think I'm going nuts.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Not in the house. Can't hear the noise outside the house sitting in the car. with the engine off.<br>

I also am a college music professor and professional musician/bassist, so naturally I attributed the ability to hear the hum to my trained auditory skills.  I first noticed it here in Carbondale around 1996 or 1997, and remember calling the City's Neighborhood Services at the time, thinking it was a nearby factory, coal mine, or something.  They came out to do an assessment, and although I finally got some of them to hear it, no one could offer an explanation.  It's difficult to mask, and earplugs don't help.  It seems to permeate materials and space, so inside is far worse than outside.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Continuous, drilling, low humming vibration, pulsating or sometimes a steady tone sound like a wind blowing through a huge metal pipe, at other times like a slow banging over a huge drum, it is not just a sound but a vibration felt in different parts of the body, in feet, head, ears, all chakras. The first time I heard it, it was in the afternoon and it sounded as a construction site with heavy machinery moving around, a few nights later I woke up to a very low bass which was omnidirectional and filling up the whole space - I thought that a neighbour was playing their bass woofer very loud. It sounds as the lowest bass guitar string, around 31Hz. At one occasion, around 12 am both my hubby and I heard a sound as coming from above which could be described as some electrical genetarot being turned on for 30 sec. If I open any of the windows, the Hum can be heard as an idling truck, but most often, as a heavy machinery being moved around in the distance, or a very long never ending heavy diesel train rumbling on the track although there are no trains at the time. It has a prominent white noise in it, being heard as water trickling, waterfall etc. heard best on a video recording. If it is very loud, I have a very bad bout of tinnitus in my left ear with a strong whah-whah-whah-element reminding me muffled many car alarms in the distance or sound of the cicadas.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, very rarely, for a period of 1 year only on 2-3 occasions. It also seems to be not perceived (for up to 48 hours) THOUGH being still present (as the white noise is always there) after a long-haul flight and a holiday.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Varies a lot<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2012<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> Late February-early March 2012<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> Left ear<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Near the river Thames where there is a Hydropower station, but also a huge base station of cell phone antennas. 3 miles away from my house there is a water treatment facility whose test siren can be heard every Tuesday morning in every one of the rooms.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 36<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Ear discomfort, Headaches, Nosebleed, Fatigue, Irritability, Sleep disturbances, Nausea, vertigo, loss of balance, anxiety, depression, feeling suicidal, vibrations on my body, electrical like tingling, buzzing, sudden muscle cramps and spasms, throbbing thyroid, heart palpitations, vibrations in the heart area, Mitral Valve Prolapse, short memory and concentration severely disturbed, ear popping, eye nerve cramps, feeling intracranial pressure and movement, it is disabling at all levels!<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> It is everywhere I go. I heard it next to the overhead power lines on each occasion I happened to be near. I heard it even on the beach in the early morning (no boats at the time).<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> A tinnitus- melodical ringing in my right ear (deaf for the Hum) which is only percetpible when the Hum becomes strong, and another form of tinnitus in my left ear which is like a white noise of water trickling, car alarms or cicadas - again, when the Hum is aggressive. Apart from that, last time I've been to an ear specialist, my ear drums were deeply retracted and Eustachian tubes needed to be insufflated (I believe from the infrasonic Hum pressure), but no hearing loss been confirmed. My hearing can be quite sensitive to loud pitches and while travelling by tube which in London can be too noisy. As a child, I tend to accumulate an excessive ear wax and had some invasive and outdated procedures for it to be removed. This problem has been overcome later.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> The Hum seems to amplify as through a loud speaker all other sounds especially at night, they sound as bursts of sounds; also the electrical heating units at home start buzzing and shaking when the Hum gets loud. The Hum becomes very aggressive after an evening of flying aircrafts just over our house and the area, and is almost non present in the rare days of non-flights. It seems to be bent over from the airwaves created by the airplanes and to change its direction and strength according to their direction. The sound is getting absorbed if the neighbors play a loud music with bass drums but becomes worse immediately after they've stopped playing. It is also very bad after heavy chemsprays, and after a sudden weather change. Rain does not attenuate it, and the vibrations felt from the Hum are always worse when it is raining. I get full of static electricity. I get random electrical zapping on different parts of my body (mostly muscles) even when at relaxed position, as if there is a form of energy being injected, inducing cramps, twitching and buzzing for a long period afterwards. I get pins and needles very often in my legs and hands which proves that the Hum is affecting the nervous system and playing havoc with it. My hands also get zapped by electrical heat buzzing impulses, but if I feel vibrations in the feet and put my hands on the floor or chair from where they seem to come, I don't perceive any vibrations with my hands. Sometimes I only feel vibrations in one foot, while the other is feeling normal. When the Hum is steady and loud, then the vibrations are less or non present. If the Hum gets a pulsed form and that deep rumbling of a diesel engine, then I have vibrations in my body and chakras. It is equally felt as physical and mental assault. It is present even in my dreams (especially during a Hum storm)! Thank you for your efforts to find the source of this menace! Good luck.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum sounds like a distant truck engine catching low gear - there is that vibrant quality to it, but the volume is about half that. It also sounds like the vibration caused by a refrigerator compressor. The hum randomly alternates to a musically near perfect "fifth" note higher, then back down. There is no predictability to the "beat". The sound persists even during power outages - as I have deliberately concentrated on listening during two power out opportunities. I travel a lot on business and I never hear this sound in hotels countrywide, so I have ruled out tinnitus. There are no hi-V tension wires near the house. There are railroad tracks less than a quarter mile away. I have some experience with musical studios, recording and performance.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Resonating humming vibration .... thudding, thumping, single hard thud, short bursts of rapid thudding ... all in a set pattern.  It has different speeds .... When it becomes faster it becomes a noise like thunder speeded up .... the
faster the more destressing.  Recently the company appear to have tried to dampen the effect, which means it has become rather more 'blurred' but no less distresssing.  I hear it outside and inside the house and outbuildings and in my car with the engine turned off.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound only stops for a few hours in a year.<br>

<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> 5th December 2009 vibrating hum began to be followed later by thudding and thumping etc. in 2010<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> Left ear<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No, I have had numerous hearing tests, examinations and even an MRI scan .... No medical issues were found.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I have traced this to the broadcasting industry.  I have kept a diary for around three years and can match certain dates with dates on their websites for changes.  Broadcasting occurs the world over, and can stop and then start again.  Changes are made....in frequency, which may take it out some sufferers hearing and into others.

In last three years I have researched every business in my area, their processes, the noise they make and operating hours.  On Christmas day 2012 I went to every factory in the area and they were all completely closed down, but the noise/vibration was exactly the same.

I have spent hundreds of hours, in the middle of the night, noise mapping the area where I live.  I am one hundred percent certain of my findings.  I have been in contact with the massive company responsible.  I believe they are trying to do something .... as changes are happening.

I do not accept that sufferers have to just cope with this distressing effect, or that nothing can be done.  I believe if we shout long enough and hard enough we will be heard. I have and something is being done.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It sounds and feels like a low frequency rumble or humming sound, guessing Infrasound or below 20Hz but it's also subtle depending on my location.  It seems to modulate in intensity but for the most part it's pretty steady.  It does sound like a diesel engine idling in the distance.  I also think it sounds like the tail end of a really low 808 kick drum being looped over and over.  I've kept a log and it seems to start around 11 pm at night until ~7 am or so in the morning.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound began in about 1993 at first it sounded like a train in the distance, funny thing was that no trains were in the area.  I looked for seven years.  I didn't hear it often so it didn't bother me.
In fall of 2004 after BPL was installed into our area the sound changed to that of a deisel engine running in the distance, thats when I started to hear it inside of my home.  Since then it has inceasingly changed to a denser and lower sounding pulse that can last up to 30 seconds or more<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It never stops completely.  the least I have heard is like a 4 second burst per minute.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Less than once per second on average<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no, I had my hearing checked actually it was better than the usual 20 db.
I asked to look at the chart and the right side showed a straight line below the norm and the left side showed another straight line above the normal<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> If it does have anything to do with non-ionizing radiation maybe height and weight would be good.
Have you read the papers by Elder and Chou, Henry Lai and JC Lin on the microwave auditory effect.  I personally think they represent something very close to the hum.  The International Commision on Non-ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP) have used these papers as references to this condition but they have stated that it is no more than aggravating but of course this was back in like 1999 or 2001.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Exactly as described by others. Very low frequency that you feel as much as here and creates pressure in your ears. Droning that pulsates between once and perhaps three times a second.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It started (or I started to hear it) about three years ago. At first it was only at night between about 2AM and 5AM, but then it started earlier and went on longer. About 3 months ago it turned in to pretty much a continuous phenomenon but does occasionally stop for as much as 20 minutes.

I put below that it is loudest in the upstairs of the house, but that only really applies at night, when it will occasionally get very loud up there.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Between once and twice per second<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> To me its like a very low frequency  mechanical engine , like that of a refrigerator that's underground . I could not understand why every night at 3am I would wake up. It was like clock work night after night, I would wake up. Then this night at _exactly 3am instead of turning on the TV to try and get back to sleep, I laid there and focus on why this was happening. I could almost feel my bed vibrating at an extremly low frequency. But it was not vibrating, it was a very low hum that seemed like it was vibrating . I got up and walked around the house to see if I could pin point the location, thinking it was something left on, and could not find it so I went outside only to hear it less.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Because it Wales me up at 3am every morning, all i'm trying to do is get back to sleep. when I finally do get back to sleep by 4 our 5am i'm so happy to get rest, I dint pay any attention cause I am fatigued from broken sleep<br>

<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> First heard what I called "the motor" when living in Punakaiki on the South Island's west coast of New Zealand back in 1990.  It seemed louder there than my present location and more noticeable at night.  I lived right on the coast and for a long time would keep checking for boats/ships out at sea as the source, but came to realise the sound was always there.  I have heard this sound in many other places I have been, but have never documented where and when.
My son can hear it but my wife and most other people I ask cannot.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> I do have some tinnitus, but that seems to be high frequencies and is very distinct as coming from within my ears as opposed to the hum which sounds external and some distance way.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I can hear a very low frequency humming noise which I sometimes feel more than hear. My husband can't hear it at all.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low frequency hum that pulses and vibrates<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound usually starts at night around 2 am in the morning it is very low frequency and can vary in length. It started about a year ago and comes and goes. Some weeks I can hear it every night and some weeks maybe three nights a week. The intensity I have noticed that when it pulses and the sound increases there are usually small earthquakes around the Los Angeles areas. I started tracking the more intense nights and there are always small earthquakes that happen on those nights. I monitor the USGS Website now  since I cant sleep until the humming dies down on the more intense nights. The intensity is increasing week by week I have noticed since january 2013<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It started in the fall of 2010. I woke up around 9 a.m. one Saturday morning and I thought to myself "What the (bleep) is this now?" It sounded like a car idling outside my window.  I waited for it to go away. It didn't, (and it hasn't, it is now Spring of 2013).  I called the police late one night, about midnight, in the Winter of early 2011. The officer that came to my home couldn't hear it.  My 14 year old son can't hear it. I unplugged ALL of my appliances and the hum was still there.

I had my Sinuses surgically "drained" by an ENT at an outpatient surgery center in November of 2011 for other medical reasons. This did not relieve the hum.

In the summer of 2012 a high pitched chirping sound like birds arguing or squirrels fighting started to accompany the hum sometimes. Now this sound is with the hum all the time after sunset.

I'm not sure, but I think my dog can hear the hum. When the hum seems to be really intense the dog seems anxious and barks when there seems to be no reason (like visitors at the door).

I made some telephone calls to find out if neighbors were running ceiling fans 24/7 (I live in a townhome)  and the answer was no. I called the city offices and made inquiries, but they were not "aware" so of course I didn't press it. I drove around trying to find the source the summer of 2012. I found two possible sources. Large generators at the Minnesota Zoo and a dysfunctional restroom venting system at the Lebanon Hills Park off of Pilot Knob Road. I made inquiries about the nearby Quarry, asking if they are mining 24/7/365 and no one could tell me. I asked my neighbor if she could hear it one evening in the Summer of 2012 and she just pointed toward the St. Paul airport and said "It's the planes."  She is 40 years of age and lives with an Air Force Veteran who is 50 year of age. It's NOT the planes.

I know this hum is not tinnitus in my ears because when I close my ears (press the ear nub tight into my ears) I can not hear it anymore. I have some high pitched ringing tinnitus and when I close my ears and I can still hear that.

In September of 2012, I became extremely ill.  I was sick with nausea and diarrhea. While I was having the gastrointestinal trouble, I felt as if there was a huge pressure inside my head. It was a painless pressure that overcame everything.  I told my son to call a friend, and she took me to the Hospital.  At the Hospital I was placed on potassium and Antibiotics but there was no definitive diagnosis as to what made me sick, even after weeks of follow-up testing and a Colonoscopy in January of 2013.

I feel a vibration in the floor of my home and in my furniture. At one point, while I was on the Antibiotics Cipro and Flagyl the Hum became intense and sounded like native war drums. After I completed the Antibiotics it returned to a low fluctuating hum.

It goes where I go.  I go to the Family Lake Home in Wisconsin and the hum is there.  I go to different places and appointments in Mpls/StP and the hum is there.  I have noticed that when I am standing near marble rock walls, (inside or outside) the hum is more intense. I do not hear it while I am driving or sitting in the car. It is louder inside my Garage than inside my home. I have an attached/tuck under garage.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> When it does seem to fade during the day, maybe once or twice a week in the afternoon, it returns within an hour. One night at around 3 a.m. in February of 2013 it was so loud and the vibration so strong the electrical outlets on my wall were 'rattling'. That has only happened once. I wake up some mornings wishing that it would stop.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> low volume frequency or droning, changes in pitch frequency every so often.  Like a generator or air conditioner unit but far more muted in sound delivery.  Feel the low frequency vibrations throughout the house, which is brick and on brick/concrete footings. Noise is actually reduced when windows are opened.  Gives the impretion that at any moment the windows and walls could start vibrating ever so slightly because of this low frequency.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Interestingly over the last few weeks it seemed to diminish in intensity somewhat, to the point that I didn't notice it too much, nor it bothered me much.  However three days ago it came back with a vengeance and has been annoying obvious to myself since.  Luckily day time vehicle traffic and local activity mutes it some, but doesn't silence it entirely.  Can only hear it prominantly inside our house and also a family members house a few streets away.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Oscillating, extreme low-pitched sound, which increases markedly around 11:30 pm; it is worse inside than out; worse in the basement the in house; sometimes feels as if it is penetrating my chest cavity. If the sound gets louder and louder over a few days, often a 6.0+ earthquake occurs, with multiple aftershocks. Between April 8th-April 11, 2012, I was becoming agitated. On April 10th at 4pm EST I called a local granite mining company asking them if they were doing fracking or something. I actually cried on the phone to the receptionist that I couldn't take the noise. This is all on record. Overnight, I went out driving around in my car at 2:30 am and found the sound was 'everywhere' within a 10 mile radius, in the car and outside. A few hours later, that huge earthquake happened over in Asia, with multiple (30)? aftershocks. Approximately 1/2 hour before that earthquake occured, the oscillating hum sound that had been building the prior week or so switch over into an open, continuous 'claxon' sound for about 10 minutes. Also, I get a headache usually 24 hours before, said headache ending shortly BEFORE the earthquake strikes.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It's like a distant engine rumbling. It is usually steady. I don't hear it if I block my ears so it is definitely coming from outside.  It gets right into my brain and is driving me nuts.  I feel it is affecting my sleep and disrupts my peace because it is constant and seems to keep something in the brain from being able to rest.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I've been noticing this sound every night for the past year, and it is usually after midnight but most prominent around 2am. I have not noticed it during the day, but that could be because there are so many other distant engine sounds.  But the disquiet I feel from it only seems to be after midnight so I don't think it happens until then, and it is usually gone in the morning.<br>

I was just trying to find out what it could possibly be.  It seems to be coming from far away as I can't hear any of the higher frequency noises you would hear from closer machines or vehicles.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Not sure<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It's like there is a lorry a street away, but not quite.
It's like the rushing of your heartbeat when you put your fingers in there, but not quite.
It's like an electric ball bouncing on a rubber mat, but not quite.
It's like the resonating sound the car makes when in a particular gear at a particular speed with the wheels not balanced right. In a way (staying with cars is easy for me :) ) it's also a bit like the sound when going over 90 km/h and rolling the window, causing the air to push in-out-in really fast, but more quiet in a background noise kind of way.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Frequency isn't usually irratic (so, mostly constant), but the times I have the most problems with it, it's changing somewhat.

I've tried everything, but move (working on moving out to a nice house outside the city)
I didn't hear it when going to the island "la palma" two years ago.

The sound came up about two and a half years ago, and I initially thought it was because I work with CNC machines a lot that make a lot of noise, but after the vacation I noted some places I don't hear the buzzing sound of my invisible, sometimes annoying friend as I've come to call it.

Earplugs will not stop it, neither will a pillow or changing the way I lay in the bed (where I mostly hear it and when it's mostly quiet outside - I live in a city, next to a electric transformer house)<br>

I'd say it's a very difficult question that can only be answered by really thinking it through. I haven't, but on first thought is my money. Then again, I don't have much of it. Second thought. My car. Still can drive to work on a bike or motorcycle, so not giving up much there either.
You know what? I'll give up 2 years of my life, reducing the length of it. It might sound silly, but as I've understood from my - late - grandfather, the last years of a life might be the most glorious.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with a bit more joy during the day.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It's a low frequency noise, like an idling truck or low motor sound.
Sometimes it is smooth and constant, yet intense.  Then, about 2 minutes later there is a slow pulsation to it.  Then after a couple of minutes, it returns to a smooth, constant sound.  It is definitely worse indoors, but I hear it outdoors also.  I only hear the sound starting around 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. and it runs through most of the night.  But, when I wake up at 4:00 a.m., there is no sound.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Alternating low vibration, similar to a washing machine somewhere in the house with many parties. But  live in a house with no other parties. Only to be heared, when everything is very quiet, when I lay down or when I meditate. I can not hear it outside. The reason may be, that it is overwritten by the wind and other sonds. Inside I can only when the windows are closed. It is more a vibration than a sound felt in the bones of the head. There are days, where I do not notice it and other days, when it is quite present. First I thought the sound is caused by the windmills, but it is also present, when there is no wind and the windmills stand still.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A very low pitched humming sound, slightly rhythmic. Sounds like a diesel  engine idling somewhere in the distance or some kind of roadworks going on far away. It penetrates deep into my inner ear and does feel like I can 'feel' the vibrations of it.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I'm not sure. I believe I hear it every night when my home is quiet.

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Since I was a child i've been able to hear strange frequencies that many of my peers have not. High pitched sounds, low pitched sounds, small changes in air pressure (eg if an inner door if opened elsewhere in the house).

I figured i just had extra sensitive hearing or something. I wonder if this is a common theme for other people hearing the hum?<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I hear, feel the sound through my right ear.  It is allow humming that varies in length and vibration.  Sometimes it is a long pulse lasting 12 to 15 seconds, other times it is a short repetitive pulse, 1 seconds over and over again!  It changes.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> When I first heard the hum, it was only at night, between 2 am and. 5 am.  That was three years ago.  For two years iI only heard  it at night.  Then, about six months ago I began hearing it 24/7!  I walked at the Nature Center and did not hear it, but when I got into my car, I could hear it.  When I go to Vermont I hear it, and recently I went on vacation to VA and noticed on the first day there, there was no hum!  It was so quiet and peaceful.  My whole body was at peace!  I had been so stressed because of the hum.  Unfortunately, the next day the hum found me!!<br>

It was then that I theorized that this is coming from space, maybe a satilite from a hostile country,( China / Russia) or something else in space!  All I know is that this hum wasn't at the resort I stayed at and then it was! Also, when I returned from VA, the hum wasn't! At my home for a day!  Now that is scary!<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Like a low revving diesel engine which throbs.
It varies in loudness some days quieter than others.
Can hear it in the house and the car.
I cannot seem to hear it outside.
If  put my ear to the wall of the house it is not louder , it is not vibrating the house structure.
It is the same in all rooms.
If I move my head slightly you can hear a change almost as if there are standing waves interfering.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, It does go away for days on end. Or maybe it has reduced to a volume where it is masked by other noises. There is a certain point where it becomes noticeable and annoying, below this point I do not concentrate on it and it becomes unnoticeable.
It was once loud enough to be heard over the TV.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low rumbling sound -- like a distant car motor (perhaps diesel) -- accompanied by a deep vibration which is felt physically.  The sound is often very steady, however occasionally it is punctuated by some rhythmic pulsing.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes.  I have heard it from time to time and explained it away as a car somewhere in the neighborhood.  This morning I awoke to it at 4 a.m. and it continued until 5:30 a.m..<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Sleep disturbances<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> <br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> I am completely deaf in my right ear -- a result of a surgery (40 years ago) to reduce symptoms of meniere's syndrome.  Residual tinnitus in right ear; increasing tinnitus in left ear.  The "hum" is distinctly differentiated from my experience of tinnitus.  The hum is clearly originating somewhere outside of my head.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> The hum is accompanied by an experience of a physical vibration felt in the body.  It is similar to the experience of being in a movie theatre when the soundtrack is resonating with a deep bass and the audience can feel the vibration from that.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It almost sounded like a train coming or a low hovering helicopter at a distance.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I only heard it one time so far since i have lived at this location but i heard it start at around 2am. I woke again at 6 am to let my dog out and it was still going 4 hours later. It was a non-stop, low pitched humming noise that would get louder like it was getting closer and then fade, it kept coming and going. I checked the local news, twitter and Facebook to see if anyone else had reported this hum that kept going but no one said anything. I am glad i am not crazy, and other people have heard this weird noise!<br>

I didn't understand how it would get louder and softer and went on for 4 hours straight. I even expressed my concern to my spouse. He was asleep the whole time but it was very creepy. No one was outside, no cars, animals or anything. If it happens again, I would like to report it again.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I have heard this low humming almost a vibrating noise late at night in south minneapolis in 3 different locations, 
I had thought maybe it had something to do with the heating system in my home but noticed I didnt always hear it when the heat was on.  I also thought it was maybe a really big truck outside idling for a long period of time. And other times have thought maybe it is a city wide noise that has to do with the sewer system or something like that. At times it has driven me crazy because you cant pinpoint where it is coming from but yet it seems to be so obviouse as well.  :)<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> When I have heard the hum it goes on for many minutes maybe even hours, long enough to stop trying to figure out what it is and start tuning it out if possible.  But then in the morning or later I notice it is not there anymore.  I have wondered if this hum is always there but i just notice it sometimes but I think it distinctly is going sometimes and others not.  Because when you hear it you cant get away from it. Atleast inside.  I have checked outside if it is there and seemed to not hear it outside the one time I checked.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I said that it is louder at night, but it varies. It could be just as loud during the day. It is 10am DST, and I can hear pretty loud right now. This is a little unusual, because during the day it seems to get drowned out by other sounds (the waking world, cars, trucks, etc.). It is a very low frequency hum sound. I first described it to my wife as a droning sound. I have been hearing almost every day. There are days when I do not hear it. I think I will start keeping a log. This sound never changes pitch, but sometimes it seems deeper or louder.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, it does, or I just don't hear it. There are days that I hear it, and days that I do not. I think I have to start keeping a log, as of today. I listen for it every day, so it is bizarre now when I don't hear it.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Okay, so hear is my simplistic theory that I have applied. I know for a fact, that I did not hear this humming sound before we had the earthquake here in August of 2011. I can only remember hearing this sound after that event. My feeling is that it has something to do with that geological phenomenon. I am the only one in this household, or my family for that matter, that can hear this sound. We were all in different locations during that earthquake, but thankfully no one was hurt. At the epicenter magnitude was 5.8 on the richter scale. The location was in Mineral, VA, which is too close to the Nuclear power plants on Lake Anna.<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> <br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> I have no medical complaints, but it a little annoying, and frustrating that no one else hear this but me. Just a little creepy, but I have sort of gotten used to it (strange,but true). I did hear it in another location, but I do not remember which one. It could only be one of three locales that I stayed in last year. The first one was on the Crystal Coast of North Carolina. A little place called Emerald Isle. The second was a small town outside of NYC, called Englewood, NJ. Last but not least, Charlotte, NC. It was one these places that I woke one morning, and could hear this sound. Just crazy!<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> None at all.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I that frequency I chose is pretty close to being correct. I have noticed that if I turn a certain way I can hear better. So I think it is directional. I can hear it through my pillow at night while going to sleep. It is a little more difficult to hear outside because of all the ambient noises. Like I said before, I distinctly recall that I never heard this sound before the earthquake, but at the same time, I would not be surprised if we getting bombarded by some unannounced radio waves of some kind. Being between 50-60 miles south of the nations Capital, along with assorted government facilities all being within the same range makes this even more believable. I am glad this questionnaire was here. Thanks!<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Classic low frequency, estimate 25 hz.  It has a palpable, tangible energy to it.  I literally makes my head vibrate.  My wife cannot hear it.  Sometimes I can reduce or eliminate its effects using earplugs or headphones with white noise.  It is worse in my basement, which has concrete walls.  I seriously believe it is coming from underground.  My house also has a RADON problem, which is consistent with gaps or voids around the foundation.  I think the HUM is related to this from an acoustical standpoint.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound does seem to stop or lessen during the day.  It is not 24x7.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Less than once per second on average<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house basement<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>

<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Foothill area of the Rocky Mountains, 70 miles from Denver Intl Airport.  Theories exist that underneath DIA are tunnels radiating out for many miles.  I have considered that the "Hum" might be coming from these tunnels.  Also, my house has a radon problem related to gaps and voids in the ground below the foundation.  I think this amplifies the HUM acoustically.<br>

Then it completely stopped and I never heard it again, not a single time, until early 2013.  It suddenly began again, and now I hear it virtually every day.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound consists of irregular long, stead pulses, sometimes resembling 2 different pitches resonating with each other and taking breaks of few seconds in very random intervals. 



I have measured the high pitch to be about 157Hz. The way I did it was comparing the hum with a quiet adjustable sine wave and using spectrum analyzer to measure the sine. It's difficult to be certain of the frequency, it feels like it's got multiple harmonics. 



This is the so far the only location I have heard it in.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum is low decibel constant hum that sounds like the rhythm of a generator.  It will disappear for a few weeks to a few months and resume.  I generally hear it very loudly during the day (in specific rooms of the house which are louder than other rooms).  At night I hear it when I lay on my side and I hear it through the pillow or when I lay on my back.  The scary thing is I have also heard this sound in Myrtle Beach, SC and recently Glen Dale, WV.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> a  low, rumbling hum, consistent with many other descriptors---we actually feel it, some times more than others---on our walks a mile or so down the road we can still hear the hum, so we've wondered about phone lines, electrical lines----whatever it is, it's real.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> (1st location plotted) - Description of Sound: I started hearing it around 12/21/12 (ish) a Morse code like modulation of a subsonic hum. I as well can compare it to the "star wars series light sabers sound" (and I am not a Star Wars fan), except when they swung and or moved the sabers the tone changed (in the movie) / this sound or humming I perceive similar to that just without the change in tone, but instead a change or pulse like increase in volume or loudness (in my ear/head) and it sometimes feels like the air pressure is increasing and decreasing with these humming modulations. I can actually feel what seems like pressure in/on my eardrum / inner ear.



I as well (for the first time) this evening 1/1/13, upon arriving home heard the hum outside of my home in my driveway upon getting out of my car to enter my home. It was quite loud as well. Prior I would go outside and hear nothing resembling the hum.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Noticed the hum about 3 years ago.  Started late at night (cannot remember what month it was though) and got out of bed to see where the truck was that idling so long.  It was so loud, actually thought it might have been a fire truck out front of the house.  The sound has never stopped.  The vibration actually hurts my ears, but I'm the only one aware of it.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Seldom one continuous hum. Always the feeling of this push and pull distant rumble.

Often, at certain times, bursts of strong hum. At CET 08.00 hrs., 10.00 hrs., 11 hrs., 13.00 hrs.17.00 hrs.. It may continue on a medium level of unsettling loudness. During these periods it has been usual that it is actually the vibration that is completely upsetting the body and mind. Like probing the mind . The anguish, the brutal force of this recent type of hum is absolutely devastating.



Late at night at 23.00 hrs. Often at 02.00 hrs. And early in the morning, almost every day, at 05.00 hrs. At this time the hum goes on till 08.00 hrs. 

From 08.00 hrs on the hum is strong, as stated before.



When there is a continuous hum, it is usually strong, and it may continue for a few days.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound is like a very low pitched "pulsating" hum that  varies in intensity, and feels like it puts pressure on your eardrums making them vibrate abnornormally. The hum itself has a rhythm to it, and its base varies.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> What I hear each morning sounds like an industrial ventilation system, perhaps a (pulp mill) or white noise associated with airports where engines are tested....we have both these sources, they are at least 20km away.  The noise is so steady, absolutely no harmonic fluctuation, consistant pitch, not a fossil fuel engine in my opinion.  I have heard it at this location in Gibsons and north of Squamish b.c. very remote, no industry and thats when I wondered what was up, or was I suffering some sort of ear damage, I consider myself a musician and I am very sensitive to sound...especially disturbing sound. Thanks, everyone for trying to figure this out! b.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Steady, bass drumming, pulsating Hum, very strong at night. No traffic or else can be heard as the village is very quiet. Dogs seem to also hear it as they start barking and howling every night, when the Hum gets really loud. Vibrations coming through the floor are also felt, and at night they come like from under the bed. Quite aggressive sound and vibe.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound is very close to my ears and I usually hear it at night. It's constant I try closing my ears but the sound keeps on going. Sometimes its not as strong as some other times but it comes and goes mildly and strongly up to with very stressful strenght. I hear it almost everywhere I go and at night when there is mostly silence. If I go outside the house the sound will keep going but there are places where I don't hear it, like in the city.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I consider this the same sound, coming from the same basic location - the train tracks. I live a few miles south of the train tracks now, and I sense the noise as coming from the same basic location. With my few miles of distance from Pocahontas Village Square, I sense the sound as slightly less acute, but still a very low frequency rumbling whine, churning and pulsating. I hear it upstairs on our second floor, and down in our concrete basement. I hear it some nights, after midnight. It usually subsides by morning, but some days, the sound continues into the day. I am usually not bothered by the sound, unless I am already having problems sleeping, stress, or anxiety. These instabilities seem to exacerbate my sensitivity to the sound, and the sound accentuates the instabilities. My cure is to remain positive, and to get plenty of exercise until my sleep patterns return to normal.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound can best be described as a bass sound.  I've seen where it's been noted to sound as an idling diesel engine, which also makes sense as I sometimes thinking I hear it (eventhough I have a fan running) and I look out the windown and notice that a truck has just passed by my apartment complex. It will make my ears feel as though they are vibrating.  There seems to be no particular time period and it varies in level.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum sounds like a low frequency rumble, as a qualified mechanic I would best describe it as an idle exhaust note from a car. The frequency is low, I would estimate somewhere around 50 hertz. There are subtle variations in volume and frequency, almost like a pulsing running through it although it's not regular or predictable. The median volume is very low and on occasion is inaudible, although the quiet periods tend to last for short periods (tens of minutes).

Unfortunately the location is somewhat close to a motorway/freeway (approximately 700 meters away) which means during the day time the hum cannot be heard due to traffic noise. Most of my family can't hear it, however my daughter and my neighbour hear it as clearly as myself and often complain or comment about it.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A hum/drone/whine, apparently consisting of a combination of two constant pitches of slightly different qualities.  The pitches are approximately in the middle octave of a piano a few tones apart.  The vibration seems to penetrate inescapably and varies little from room to room. Oddly it seems to come from the direction where any window is in each room, regardless of orientation, hence my view that it is actually outside the property.  The hum seems to come from outside the bungalow but is not audible outdoors due to the background sounds of nature such as air movement.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very low frequency hum, I would estimate the frequency between 50-120 htz. Sounds like a large Diesel engine generator or semi truck engine idling. Hum is not variable, stays at constant frequency, although at night while trying to sleep there is a slight increases in the intensity as if a load was put on an engine etc. When semi trucks are accelerating on a nearby road, I can hear the hum oscillating with the hum in the house. If everything in the house is quiet, I can move my head and notice the resonating hum in any room in the house including the basement. I do not hear the hum in some buildings in the downtown area of Peoria, IL, so I know it is an external sound not produced by my own ears.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Intermittent pulsating/vibrating hum that occurs during the winter months when ground is frozen.  The colder and more frozen the ground, the more intense and frequent.  Sounds like an idling diesel train engine.  I have eliminated all logical sources from my house and has been occuring for several years now. The noise makes the southwest corner of my house vibrate.  This part of house sits on a concrete slab, no basement.  Sound not heard outside.  Basically, my wood framing and sheet rock acts like a speaker for this sound, which i thinks is coming from ground somewhere.  Perhaps the frozen ground carries soundwaves better than soft ground is my theory.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very deep rumbling Hum and vibration felt mostly on my chest, heart, gut, hands and feet. I feel those vibrations while lying on the bed, and my whole body trembles as if there is an earthquake. My muscles start twitching. My hubby also felt vibrations in the chest (while in the bed) although he is not a Hum hearer! The Hum is constant, with almost no breaks, and is getting louder after 10 pm. It becomes very aggressive when it is raining or the ground is wet/humid. I felt also my head vibrating with jaws and teeth while in a rested position in bed. It was quite strong and frightening. I also heard a banging sound from underneath (my mattress) and as if there was a gas ignition. The Hum can be so strong that I hear it outside on the balcony. I also feel very strong vibrations in the feet and pressure on the chest in the garden, while staying on the green grass.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It sounds like a mix of a car and an air conditioner off in the distance. It's not a car though, because when I hear a car in the distance, I know it's a car because there is a fade in and out with a car. This is constant. It's been here since I can remember. Also, if it were an air conditioner, it would turn off and on. This is constant, and no matter where in the house I am, I can hear it. Windows closed and all.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It sounds like a diesel locomotive idling on a track somewhere or a big diesel truck idling. It throbs about the same rate as a human heart beats. When we lived here in Swanton last year the hum would cease almost every night around 10:30 PM. Around an hour later it would start up again in varying amplitudes. I could hear it in any room of the house.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> it was a strong metallic sound organized in phases with some short pauses. we heard some recordings about hum in Kiev and if they are not fake recordings, what we heard in our living room was really similar to that. it was stronger in the house than outside and was clearly audible during two episodes both in april 2013. all the persons in the house (4 persons) clearly heard it. in both episodes it seemed the sound was spreading from the roof of the living room. at first it sounded like wind passing throughout a metallic structure but there was no wind outside, it was a quiet and sunny day, and further opening the window the sound suddenly dropped in intensity, but was always audible somehow even if more diffuse. I was not able to identify the source of the sound outside.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It sounds mechanical, sometimes like a pounding (?), sometimes like a train moving along the tracks, most often at night.  Depending upon the weather - usually clear, sometimes with low clouds, I can hear it better outside.  I can hear it inside at almost any time of day or night, but I haven't noticed any patterns, or how frequently a month.  At night, in the late spring, it's almost maddening - sometimes I can't even pinpoint which direction it's coming from.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> typical: engine idle type sound.

also: steady hum with no pulse or buried pulse.

pulse variations- slow, rapid, deep, steady, or slow broken asynchronous pulse.

thunderous rumble, very light intensity to strong intensity. most often at night after 10:30pm for rumbles , but this can vary.

heavy hum sounds like large, even huge industry.

light hum sounds like small or distant industry.

there is no industry here for at least 45 miles in any direction and then only isolated pockets of industry.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> not often , but yes sometimes. 

aug 30 - sept 4 , 2012 

oct 10,2012.

dec 14-15,2012 dec. 17-19, 2012

jan. 1-3,2013.

quiet days throughout jan.2012. it would still rumble up late at night sometimes for only an hour or two.

March and April.2013- the hum can go very light, almost imperceptible , yet still be detected. there were times in March &amp; April when the hum would go obviously silent and then obviously come back strong.

sometimes these transitions were very rapid , coming and going in perhaps ten minute intervals, more often the hum would appear briefly go away for an hour or two and then return again briefly.

one morning it came and went at least 6 times. obviously on/obviously off.

still very unusual hum behavior in my experience.

often the hum will go lighter in the late afternoon or evening, and return stronger after 10:30pm CST. too many nights like these to keep track of.

any patterns that the hum seems to follow it will then break.

constantly innovating. the hum strikes me as a minimalist composer extraordinaire, except it&#39;s music is mostly awful.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Varies a lot<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> Outside<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With effort<br>

<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> 1/29/2012<br>

45 miles to the southwest.

I thought this was a quiet location, but I have heard the hum here on several visits in 2013.

I have a sense that Rhinelander is on the outer edge of the hum area I seem to be living in.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> to the question: Where is it loudest ? I would have answered - all of the above.

It is as loud inside as it is outside as it is 15 miles away.

This seems to be a large hum area.

A hum area location, as big as Windsor, Ontario. Canada.

I have researched the Windsor Hum extensively and I keep track of current conditions there via a Facebook group.

Often there are parallels or correlations.

There is no industry where I live, yet often the hum I hear sounds like industry. I have heard Zug Island scale industry emanating from this hum.

Hum super storms in Aug., Sept., Oct. , Nov. 2012.

I would like to see a research brigade of hum hearers who could travel to different hum locations and corroborate these disparate hums.

I believe the most sophisticated device for hum detection we have is hum hearers themselves. I would like to state that empirical study is science, and often is the best science. The map and the survey are a good example of this. Measurements would be great , but so far seem somehow problematic or inconclusive. The hum phenomenon has a history, an empirical history which should not be overlook or dismissed to easily. The salient characteristics of the hum for me are the description of what it sounds like and the description of the affect on the person. I believe this combination indicates "the hum", wherever or whenever.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It is a low humming frequency sound that is loudest inside of the house. It does not seem to vary much even if I put headphones on, I find that strange! It almost sounds as though someone is drilling under ground and the vibration made from the equipment is what can be heard. It could also be described as a vibrating extractor fan<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It sounds lower during the day, not noticeable but maybe thats just because I am distracted and not so aware. It's the same volume upstairs as it is in the kitchen, sitting room, the house next door.. outside it's lower but that might be due to other ambient sounds<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Reminds me of a distant electrical transformer or large motor engine.  It is not an even tone but  undulates. It is a very low tone.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, I don't hear it every day.  It is usually most obvious when I have been outside and come into a quiet house. Seems louder at night.

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> Slightly hard of hearing in my left ear<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> When I first noticed the hum (January 2013), it really bothered me.  I was afraid there was something wrong with our house like a bad electrical outlet.  We unplugged everthing in the home to check.  I went next door and across the street and could hear it in their homes too.  So that calmed my fear that it was something wrong with our home.  I thought it was just a bad distant electrical transformer.  When I came across "The Hum" information a couple months ago, I was so glad to find I was not alone.  Since I no longer fear it, it does not keep me awake anymore.  I seem to be able to tune it out.  That is a good thing because when I was worried about it, nothing could block it out.  No one else in my family can hear it. It is not tinnitis as I have that also and can differentiate between the two sounds.  Tinnitis is a higher pitched  "shhhh" sound and does not undulate. Thank you for working on this.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Middle frequency hum.  Only in quiet spaces.  Any sound eliminates it. And when I move my head, even slightly it stops.  If I continuously move my head it stops.  For instance, if I make a series of figure 8's with my nose...as long as I'm moving the hum is gone.  As soon as I stop moving it returns.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It stops often.  It will stop for months and then return for months.  Sometimes it will stop for a week or two, sometimes a day or two.  It's nice when it stops.  



Any sound will make it stop.  Slight wind or the rustle of trees and grass outside will make it stop.  There is usually enough ambient sound out of doors that I never hear it unless I'm indoors and it's quiet. And as I said above, head movement makes it stop.



In answer to where is it the loudest below...it's the loudest in very quiet areas.  Upstairs, downstairs, basement...location doesn't matter other than it must be a quiet location.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Lake Michigan is three blocks away from my home in Beverly Shores.  But the sound of the lake makes the hum go away.  I also hear the hum at my home in Glen Ellyn, Ilinois.  The effects there are identical.  Beverly Shores has lake dunes topography.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The humming sound that I have been hearing almost daily for practically two years is a very low frequency sound. During the detailed survey I took there was a question in which specific frequencies were chosen for the sound. This sound that I hear is in the specified area described above. I have heard this sound in another location on the East Coast, but could not remember exactly which place. It can only be one of three places. The Crystal Coast, which is the southern most portion of the Outer Banks, NC, Englewood, NJ, just outside of New York City across the Hudson River, or in Charlotte, NC.<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> <br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I have my own theory as to what the sound may be caused by, due to the reasoning that seems logical. In our area of Virginia, about two years ago, we had an earthquake with a seismic magnitude of 5.8 on the richter scale. Ever since that event occurred I have heard this humming sound. I did not hear this sound before that incident. I feel that this sound may be directly or indirectly related to the hum. Fractures in the earth with low frequency sounds seeping out of it. It is a strong possibility. This is just one of my theories.<br>

I thought it a bit odd that all 37 of the people all suffer from this. I was unaware of the hum until I noticed it, I was outside at night, no traffic and very little noise in Golders Green 2.00am. So enjoying the break from the usual city noises, I heard this constant hum and since then being aware of this, whether outside or inside in London I am now constantly aware of it. More and more, I ask others do they hear the hum and many people have also noticed it. So is everyone suffering from tinnitus or is this the result of technological frequencies, mobile phones, Wifi, Digital Television, energy saving lightbulbs, etc.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Like Taos.wav recording, but pitch &amp; frequency changes with fluctuations.  Some periods in summer with no sound like it takes vacations. All around -- outside and inside.  Sometimes very loud, sometimes further away.  SOUNDS LIKE IS UNDERGROUND, but is just as annoying in my driveway.  Can hear it as soon as I turn off my car in the driveway.  Louder/more concentrated in basement. Rural area with woods in small valley, littered with OLD COAL MINES and plasma-type morphing UFOs frequenting area since 2008.  Hearing it and FEELING IT VIBRATE inside my head since 1999 in right ear only which might be because it has larger ear canal then left ear?
Sample of UFOs filmed in area that SUCK ELECTRIC OFF POWER LINES cutting power to homes for very short on/off periods, typically in evening/early AM hours (more on my Youtube channel-check the page):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JVELzuuIJo
EVERY hill of woods they frequent around here have OLD COAL MINES IN THEM.
I think if you check some of the other areas hearing the HUM, I bet those areas also have old mines underground too.<br>

Sound only cancelled out by playing white noise constantly.... MADDENING OTHERWISE.
No physical problems like headaches, just SUPER ANNOYING.
Multiple attempts to record it have not produced same sound as heard.
German researchers have tried and failed to record them and suspect that the crystals that sometimes form on the pineal glands of older Hum Hearers might be acting as a radio crystal which are picking up the sounds... which would explain why majority of hearers are over age of 40.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I hear this humming noise in central valley northern cali. Every night my mind get's fixated on it and i can't sleep. It's like a low humming that increases and decreases in volume. Sometimes it completely stops for a few minutes or seconds just to start again. Hundreds of people hear this and nobody knows what it is. I wish somebody could tell me??<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very low frequency. (we've just had an environmental officer visit us with a meter and the sensitive equipment barely registered anything, although I was being driven mad by it !) It varies from a strong modulation to almost a continuous sound but, with a kind of caught in the wind effect (drifting, is the best I can come up with ) Their is a kind of diesel sound to it but to me it has a kind of vibration that's reminiscent of the sound that some times comes from a spinning top.  Somewhere between vibration and sound (if that makes sense!)<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> <br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Detail.  Ok, we have lived here for about Twelve years but the sound is only about Two years old.  It has abated from time to time but is usually present.  It has moments of infuriating intensity, usually in the night hours. We appear to be the only people affected by it, even though we live in a terrace !  There is a deeply disturbing quality to it.  In that it is not entirely focused on the ear drums ( at least, that's my experience of it ! ). There seems to be a band of reception that runs between my ear's, making it a kind of "rear cranial" experience.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> One sustained note, lasting about 10-20 seconds. Non-oscillating. Low frequency. Overwhelming volume, seeming to resonate all around (inside concrete building). Seemed to make me feel like I was vibrating at a very high rate. Definitely mechanical or man-made. At first I thought it was bass from a car at the light... but it was louder and deeper than what can be produced from a car. Extremely agitating frequency and volume. When it stopped, I still felt like there were residual background noise, similar to an amplification of the A/C currently running... I don't know if this is just simply residual noise, like some sort of auditory footprint. Very unsettling experience. It is now 3:35 AM and my left ear seems to be irritated.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It was one elongated burst... it just happened about 3:00 AM (perhaps a few minutes before). Again, there was a residual footprint sort of sound, but I don't know if it was real or just my brain and body still recovering from it. It was such an overwhelming sound that I actually wondered if I had physcially been affected in some way. It made my body feel almost tingly with vibration. My wife did not seem to be affected. Will ask her when she wakes. I will also need to go check on my dog after this entry.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Irritating low frequency humming. Just loud enough to make you want to tear hair.

Have been wondering if anyone has checked to see if dogs and other animals are being disturbed by this. I would think dogs would be especially sensitive and annoyed.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Difficult to pin point as I oft times play music in an attempt to bury IT.

Will play music through IPOD and buds at night until falling to sleep and play stereo during day to cover. 

Some days/nights on, then it disappears. It's frustrating we all know.

I think it has something to do with military installations, primarily US holdings or affiliates.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> As a child on a still very day, we could sometimes hear the Air Force Orion warming up in the far distance.  This is very similar, a very deep hum like a very large plane in the far distance that does not get closer or further away.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low pulsating and droning sound.  Sometimes during the same event it starts off louder and after 10 or 15 minutes the intensity decreases.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Last year the sound started around 4 am and lasted about 15 to 30 minutes

The first time I have heard it this year was May 25, 2013 and it started at 3am and lasted 20 minutes.  I had been up for 10 minutes walking around to try and find where it was coming from and it abruptly stopped.  It was so loud that I could hear it while up and walking around.  Some days last year it was of a lower intensity and I could hear it the best with one ear pressed to the pillow.

My husband heard it one time last year when it was louder and we could hear it outside in our backyard.  It was hard to hear where it was coming from.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> There is a sewage treatment plant about 5 miles south of me.  We also have a sewer manhole cover in our backyard.  My theory is that we are hearing the pumping of sewage from the city north of us to the sewage treatment plant.  I am a mechanical engineer and the sound reminds me of a pump sound.  When I called the sewage plant manager they claim they are not doing anything to make noise in the middle of the night.

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> it seems like it is a very distant sound. Sounds like base from a car?

<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It is not constant all the time. Sometimes it is steady with no breaks, other times it will start and stop for a split second and then go again,.

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No medical issues with hearing. I was tested for tinnitus and oto-acoustic emissions at University of New Mexico during original hum investigation in 1990's<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I was a participant and part of the team that investigated the Taos Hum under Prof. Joe Mullins of the UNM Mechanical Engineering Dept. I spent several nights attempting to detect the hum with then Sandia National Lab tech Horace Poteet. Horace could also sense the hum and he and I verified it's presence so that other members of the team could attempt a detection using a variety of sensors.

Horace and I used the "Big Ear" microphone developed by Prof. Joe Mullins and we attempted to capture the hum. We could not find any evidence of an acoustic low frequency sound signature and at one point early in the morning, looked at each other and declared "this is not a sound." 

The remainder of the team present held a short meeting at which one of them said he needed to brush up on his "Tesla."

Although I am not listed as a team member, I can assure you that I was in fact present during the attempt to capture the hum and that the following day I presented the team with a perfect match for the hum by using two audio oscillators at 31 HZ with one of the audio oscillators de-tuned to produce a slow beat frequency. I then added a little bit of FM modulation to one of the tones and that was a match.



I find that the survey questions do not go deep enough. For example, "Which ear is it the strongest?" Since I do not believe that I am "hearing" the hum, I am not using my ears as sensors. I chose the answer "not sure."

There, perhaps, should be a category asking if the respondent senses or hears the hum. For me, after a long and thorough search for hums source, I have determined that it I sense it but do not hear it.



Here is another bit of general observation. Once, I was ascending the Picuris Peak mountain in the winter during 1993 or 1994 and I had to wait while my partner attempted to break a trail to the peak. It was very, very quiet with freshly fallen snow and as I settled in to wait, the hum was easily discerned. I spent my time focusing on it, trying to determine a pattern to it's beat and modulation. I realized that it seemed to be "intelligently" varied as I could determine no random nature to it's pattern. It reminded me of a modem. A carrier with data encrypted as modulation. As I was making this "observation" the hum suddenly stopped! There were a few seconds of absolute silence and then I heard the approach of the Doppler of a high flying jet aircraft which effectively masked the hum. As the aircraft passed by and I could no longer hear it, again there was a few seconds of silence after which the hum returned. This was repeated a few times as more high flying jet aircraft passed by. I do not believe that the jet aircraft had anything to do with the cause of the hum as they were most likely scheduled passenger jet service. What I did determine from the observation is that although the sound of the jet aircraft effectively masked the hum, there were the few seconds of silence on either side of the audible masking. Perhaps I could sense the masking but not hear the jet aircraft as it just came into and just went out of my hearing range.

I am interested in contributing more to this on-going mystery, although I have reason to believe that the Taos hum is associated with the US Navy ELF Submarine Communications system. I have also noted an increase in intensity of the hum during times of heightened military alert prior to the Iraq - Afghanistan wars. Now, there seems to be a permanent state of heightened military alert.

I have also learned how to effectively block the hum from affecting me in my daily life. I only have to focus on sensing it to recall it now. I lived in Taos from 1972 until 2002 with only a few years spent in California and Colorado. I now live near Sarasota, Florida and on cool autumn and spring nights when everyone's AC is not running, the hum comes out of mask and into my senses.<br>

<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Starts around 1:30AM and stops around 7AM.  This has varied somewhat over the past two years, sometimes starting around midnight and going to 8:30 AM.  There are stretches of a week or more that I don't hear it at all, and then it is back.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> There are gravel pits nearby.  There is also a wood cutting operation that cuts trees into the size logs you would buy in a bundle at a convenience store. I don't know when they are cutting and what that sounds like. I live near a good sized lake. There are windmills being installed around the state.  There is a government oceanographic facility a few miles from my house. The state university is not far from my house and they do various kinds of research.<br>

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I heard the hum with both ears for about a year and a half, for the past six months only hear it in the right ear.  I have tried earplugs, playing music on headphones, white noise, television talking to drown out the sound. None of that worked. Heavy fabric drapes with black out/thermal liners have helped muffle the sound also a large padded headboard.  Sometimes I hear the noise coming from the ceiling vent in my bathroom that has no windows and no exterior walls.  My husband who has hearing issues does not hear the hum, but he did a few times about two years ago when it seemed louder to me.<br>

I have yet to ask neighbors if they have noticed it. I have yet to explore outdoors in the night to see if I can hear it.  I only have 1 story house, so the question is somewhat misleading - not loudest on first floor - we only have  1 floor.  A good question might be how many people in hour household hear it.   And state that if separate households in the vicinity hear it, they should make their own entry /report. or perhaps you want each person to file their own report - probably best.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> During the day<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It is very soft and sub-bass.  It sounds like a big diesel engine in the distance idling at a low speed.  However it cannot be a diesel engine because if it were, it would be running far too roughly to be in service anywhere.

Imagine a diesel engine idling that runs smoothly for 3 to 5 seconds and then misfires (skips a pulse or has an extra pulse) and then continues for another 3 to 5 seconds, misfires again, and just keeps on doing this.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I was inside the bunker for ~20 minutes during which both I and my wife observed the sound continuously.  The sound never ceased, and never increased nor decreased in amplitude during that time.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> There are a couple of old, vacated military bunkers in the hillside near the sea.

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I live in the Minneapolis / St Paul, Minnesota area and have never heard the hum before or since.  I heard the hum at Cape Spear, Newfoundland while on vacation.

However I have subsequently listened to a recording of "the hum" on the internet which sounds almost like a diesel engine, and my experience of that was one of recognition.  I recognized it as exactly he sound that I heard at Cape Spear.

This appears to be a previously unreported location.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Like a lorry ticking over a few yards away.
We first thought it could be a distillery nearby but after making enquieries we found out that at the time we noticed the humming sound the distillery in particular was not even running and they informed us that none of the eqipment used would make a noise like the hum.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes it seems to build in intensity over 2-3 days until no one can sleep for it then dies down in the same amount of time.
I personally suffered terrible headaches and nuasea when the humming was at it's worst and my brother suffered the worst nosebleeds i have ever witnessed. Despite seing doctor after doctor there was no medical reason behind our symptoms.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Around once per second on average<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2002<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> <br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> The only thing we found was our house seems to sit in the centre of crossed lay lines which i personally feel give off their own energy field.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 23<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Ear discomfort, Headaches, Nosebleed, Fatigue, Irritability, Sleep disturbances, Nausea, depression<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> I hear it most places i go including Turriff, Huntly, Aberdeen, New Deer, Maud, Banff and many more including most places in Aberdeenshire and Morayshire.
All these places are in Scotland.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> We also noticed that whenever the humming started we would see strange red lights in the sky and they would appear and disappear almost at will, we would watch them dive down into the hill and we would expect to see fire or something because at first we thought these were planes, but i have a  very close friend who has been a pilot for many years came to watch these lights on a number of occasions and said that if there is an aircraft that can pull maeovers like that he's never heard of it.
Sometimes they would have white lights in the middle of a triangle of red lights, the only thing i've found that comes close to what me and my friends and family have witnessed are (call me crazy) ufo's! I strongly believe that the two are connected! Or it could have something to do with all the reptillians living underground.<br>

Also, I do notice that when my attention is elsewhere, I don't hear it. I'm of the opinion that it's a combination of a definite phenomena (i.e. something producing the noise) but that that my experience is moderated by my own perceptions.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It's just a hum like sound. Most if the time it's distant but at times the sound rises just a bit. It's almost not a sound as much as it is a vibration. I can't hear it when I'm outside, only in the hose. Again it's more like a vibration that I am tuned in with than a sound. If I try to listen to headphones for example, I can still "feel" this humming.<br>

Up and down, up and down... on and on and on and on....<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I hear two frequencies and am not sure if they are related.  One is very high pitched (very high ringing in ears) and I hear it all the time but can ignore it OK. The much more disturbing one is very low pitched like a washing machine left on in the house at night. The first day I heard it was 30th Aug 2012.  It was nauseating and seemed to come up through the bed, the pillows - like a vibration. My wife has never heard it and my neighbors can't hear it either. A feature of this sound is that it is intermittent - like a bit of Morse code - the same bit going over and over again.  My sleep was virtually non existent and this went on for months but has now calmed down so now i really have to listen for it and it's not happening every night like it was at the beginning.  I even heard it, but not so loud, when we went on holiday to Spain (again only at night).  I can't hear it outside the house but it's all over the interior of the house.  Another good description of the sound is like a car parked outside the house with the engine running.  I believe when it was strong it affected my health and recently I had the most debilitating flu I have had for years.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I have heard it during the day but I have to really try.  It only really becomes awful at night and at varying degrees of volume.  There were days as it got better when some nights were free only to start up again. I have measured the EM levels and the radio frequency levels  with meters, which were both quite low and what would be considered normal background radiation.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Between once and twice per second<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Headaches, Fatigue, Irritability, Sleep disturbances, Nausea<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> Nerja, Spain while on holiday.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I contacted a company that specializes in EM field protection and they played me an amplified recording of the G4 phone network signal.  It was very near to the sound I hear but very slightly different in pitch and frequency of drone.  I used a meter to measure levels of phone mast radiation and they were quite low in my bedroom where I hear it and on the ground floor but were rather high in the upper attic rooms. I thought I was going mad with this as no one else seems to hear it.  I did find a report of someone hearing it and got her story in the Daily Mail newspaper.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low pitch all pervasive non directional hum similar to a noisy mains transformer. Also similar to large electrical generating sets heard from a distance (I used to work with these). May also be a bit like a TBM (tunnel boring machine) or similar deep mining equipment.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound seems to be fairly constant in pitch and volume. First noticed on Thursday 30th May 2013. It has been continuous ever since. I can limit the effect of the sound with ear plugs so am fairly sure that it is not internally generated (eg tinnitus)<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> My hearing has been affected by long term exposure to noisy machinery but otherwise is ok.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> What about other witnesses? My wife can't hear the sound but her general hearing is more acute than mine. One of my immediate neighbours can hear it, but a neighbour on the other side can't. I can hear the sound in the street but it is more concentrated in certain points, inside the house, that seem to amplify it, eg doorways. I will try and match the sound and fill in the section above.
The sections should have numbers so that they can be easily identified.
Can you advise on suitable equipment that might be able to record the sound. So far my sound recordings don't resemble the hum, when played back.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Usually a very low droning noise like an idling car engine, but the frequency can increase during the night, and can peak with a whirring noise that makes it feel like the whole house is vibrating. The frequency seems to be just on the edge of what I can pick up, but 'feels' loud in my head and is uncomfortable. The sound seems to 'throb' although it is not uniform, and occasionally has a hollow thudding noise like the end of a pipe being banged. I can drown it out with white noise on my MP3 player, but not with ear plugs. Strangely, it stops if I shake my head around.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It varies, and there have been gaps of months when I do not perceive it. It started about five years ago, and has bothered me for most of the time since. I don't normally hear it during the day when it is drowned out by other noise. It seems to peak during the early hours and again at around 8.30am.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Less than once per second on average<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With effort<br>

 About 15 years ago we shored up the west side of the house with piers. The piers rest on a rock shelf. I hear the "hum" at night, in bed. I sleep on that side of the room and I believe that the sound is traveling up the piering and into the walls. My husband has heard it as well.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> At first it was like the hum of a large transformer. Sometimes however, the tone changes and it sounds more like an air conditioner running several doors away.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Sometimes it is a steady thing, however, it is often drowned out by tinnitus. I do not seem to hear it in the daytime, only in bed or late at night.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>

<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> I live in a wide river valley between the Coast Range mountains (hills) and the Cascade Range. They are a line of active, though dormant, volcanoes spawned by the subducting Faralon Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone (Volcanic arcs quite often, if not always, form about one or two hundred miles beyond a subduction zone in the direction of travel of the subducting plate).
We also have considerable, though relatively inactive, stress faulting in the valley apparently as a result of compressive forces exerted on the North American Plate by the previously mentioned Faralon Plate.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 62<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> None<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> In the Cascade Mountains. I have not been to another city since regularly hearing this sound.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> I do not hear very well. I have moderately extreme tinnitus, for which reason the hum is of no great concern. The tinnitus is a right ear issue, though recently, high volume sounds have induced "sympathetic" ringing in my left ear. The hum is only heard in the left ear.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> 1. Does the sound change when fingers are placed in the ears? No. 
2. Sound was much louder up in mountains near hot springs this last weekend, to the point that I could hear it over a moderately loud rushing river.
3. Big one here, brought to mind by number two, above - If the sound, or whatever it is, is an Earth generated phenomenon, might it change radically prior to a major release of energy such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption. Note that it is reported that the elephants at Banda Aceh, Indonesia broke free and fled inland prior to the arrival of the tsunami. The Chinese also report erratic actions from animals prior to a recent earthquake. 
So, though I know this might flood an e-mail account, and might require letting the e-mails build up until there is a major event at which time they could be looked back through to see if any patterns develop. Might it be worthwhile to set up a link or advise people where they might report a significant or alarming change in the hum? Thank You<br>

It's like an explosion is happening outside my house, but it is constant and does not stop. I have been hearing it for about an hour now. I tried earplugs, to no avail. I googled it and saw that this matched the description of what I have been hearing, and wanted to contribute to figuring out what this is.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Distant idling diesel engine - a bit like being on board a ship with the constant engine noise/vibration.  Another description is a washing machine on a spin cycle in a distant room.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Less noticable during the day, but probably due to being swamped by increased environmental noise.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> Little effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2013<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> May 2013, but only because this is when I moved to this location.  Never heard it before this.<br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> None that I know of, have only just moved to the area.<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> <br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> Never heard it anywhere or any time before.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No, I have regular hearing tests through employment and never had any issues.  I have had some exposure to loud noises in the past, mainly through working on airfields (e.g. jet noise).  In fact the hum reminds me of the sound of a helicopter flying nearby.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I only hear the hum indise my house or immediately outside.  I don't seem to hear it anywhere else in Exeter, indoors or outside, although this might be due to increased environmental noise - it is very quiet around my house with little audible traffic noise.  I have only just moved to my current address, and it is the quietest place I have ever lived - previously I have always lived on or near busy main roads.  The hum is quiet, to the extent that having the TV on drowns it out, in fact it is almost more like a vibration rather than a noise.  Sometimes it is a little bit louder, sometimes so quiet that I struggle to hear it (but it definitely hasn't stopped).  I generally stop noticing it when I am busy with something; if I am not doing anything I begin to focus on it and notice it more.  I notice it mostly at night after I've gone to bed, and first thing in the morning when I wake up, though again that may be due to the lack of environmental noise and nothing else to focus on.  Earplugs don't diminish it.<br>

Does wearing ear protection help? cotton wool in ears doesn't help but army ear mufflers do but I can then hear my heart beatting instead.
How does it make you feel? Tired, frustrated, angry, and when I tell people I can hear it they listen and can't hear it so 'Im told I'm going mad!<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> In the mornings. At first, I thought it was my neighbour's truck warming up, but when I moved, there is no neighbour with a truck.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A deep, vibrating, pulsating noise - sounds similar to the deepest bass frequency you can imagine coming from a speaker but it reverberates around as if it's moving, I find that I often hear it most when I'm lying down but it persists even when I'm sitting up. The sound is akin to a reverberating bass tone from far away but it changes in frequency too much for it to be anything I can picture making the sound - I also live in a very rural area where there are practically no factories whatsoever but alot of hills and woodland.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, during the day I don't hear it nearly as often but it still is present occasionally. It's most pronounced during the night - typically around 12-1AM but often later than that. Often I'll hear it and register hearing it but not really be that surprised by it - it's a frequent thing around here.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Rumbling hum that seems to be coming from either under the bed, or in the walls. I can never actually find it. So putting my ear to the floor, under the bed, against the wall etc, never results in finding the sound. It's just there.

Sometimes there is also a sharp piercing sound from time to time. It is hard to describe, almost electric or metallic. It is not as frequent. Like an occasional spike in sound. It is uncomfortable, but not painful or anything. Just odd. It scared me at first but I have gotten used to it.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Not sure if the sound stops or if I just get used to it. I don't think it does.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It sounds like a large 18-wheeler hauling something big, like windmill or industrial plant parts on the highway about a half mile away, except the highway where i am is about two miles away and the sound itself never grows or diminishes like you could expect for something that approaches and then, logically, leaves in another direction. Just a large humming noise that last on average about 2-3 minutes. I usually hear it when I'm smoking outside so i've never really heard it 'start', just the last few minutes while i smoke.

Another way to describe it is like distant thunder, except it goes on for minutes as opposed to short pulses.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, see above. I usually hear it for a few minutes on my smoke break. It doesn't really taper off, it's just then, and then there's a sharp decline and then it's gone. It's somewhat regular in that i'll catch it sometimes 2-3 times a night at different volume levels. Although I don't hear it every night.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> Outside<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> Little effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2013<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> <br>
<b>In which ear is it the strongest?:</b> equally in both ears<br>
<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Not sure<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Seattle, so there's a few. The closest is Lake Washington, then there's Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, and all kinds of geological anomalies like the current megaquake situation that's due any year, which i attribute it to as some sort of plate settling, personally.<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> No.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Not really! Altough I guess it was more frequent closer to the sunsets around equinox time. That would be my only observation. I'm still listening for this 'humming' as it definitely doesn't 'act' like normal traffic noise. I've even told other people about it and gotten a lot of quizzical looks. I just learned about the hum today and this project so i really appreciate what you guys are doing in aggregating this info on this most interesting phenomena.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A persistent low pitched hum, like that of an idle engine. It doesn't emanate from any one direction, feels as if surrounded by it. The source of it sounds far away. Same loudness every night, doesn't fluctuate, and same sound (timbre) every night.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It first reminded me of the scary wind in the classic movie, The Evil Dead, wherein it's a low rolling pitch that gradually builds up. I can only compare it to that scary movie 'wind' because I just can't properly describe it otherwise.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It usually builds up and then after a minute or so it dissipates. I thought everyone else could hear it and just thought it was normal and ignored it, but it's not like an airplane taking off and when I tried to compare the sound to a scary movie other people didn't hear the sound in the first place.<br>

<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> Poway is reasonably seismologically stable compared to the rest of California.  The city is mostly a suburban residential zone at an elevation near 500 feet above sea level with a few hills poking above 1000 feet and a small set of mountains to the east rising above 2000 feet.  There are two small reservoirs to the northeast (Lake Poway and Lake Ramona), a medium reservoir to the northwest (Lake Hodges), and two large reservoirs to the southeast (San Vicente Reservoir and El Capitan Reservoir), one of which is currently undergoing the largest dam raise in United States history (This almost certainly has nothing to do with the hum.  I have checked this—someone standing at the hum location reported above was hearing it while I was near the dam and heard nothing.).<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The hum sounds like the earth is vibrating, the closest sound I can describe is when you're in the city and you hear transport trucks at high speeds far away. Where I am is rural, and the nearest highway is more than 10 km away. So when I first heard the hum I thought that maybe it was the highway. But as I continued to hear it each night at times where maybe there wouldn't be heavy truck traffic (3 or 4 am), I realized that it couldn't possibly be the highway. 
My mom listened to it too, and she described it as the earth vibrating.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> When I hear this in the summer hum I hear it between ~22:00 and ~6:00. Only sometimes and only when there is no other loud sound noices around me. First I thought it was my heartbeat but thats definately not it because it lacks the sound of the heart when it pumps blood around the body. Stangely enough its turned around in the winter and I can hear the sound during the day. In autumn and spring I dont hear the sound at all<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes, its only some periods of the day and night I hear it. I'm hearing this sound for +3 years now and strangly enough I noticed that in the summer I hear this hum at night and in the winter its during the day and never the night. I dont know what it is and most of the people dont even notice it to the degree I think its something with my hearing. But my hearing is fine. 
If you would hold me at gunpoint then I would say this sound is coming from space. BVased on the fact that we turn around the sun would explain the difference between summer and winter and when I hear nothing in the spring/autumn. The sound get less when I get closer to my wifi station (it seems to interupt the hum and not causing it like I previously thought)<br>

The owners of the voltage line told us it was not high voltage but middle voltage. No Hum could possibly come from there.

Some know of it, others tell you to get your ears examined . We did. No tinnitus but still the Hum.

The Hum seems louder outside when the humidity in the air is high.
That's why we thought it could be the voltage lines.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Its like a rumbling, i have a subwoofer i use to listen to music and movies and recently i have been keeping it off at night with my roommates new bed time. At around 2 am it will begin and go in and out. I keep a window open as i smoke in the sunroom i am in and whenever i go to listen i know its coming from outside yet it gets quieter the more i feel like i proceed toward said source. There are also times when booms occur, in that i mean like a hard kick drum sounding boom with minimal high tones interrupts the drone like humming.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Oscillating sound, deep and low vibration, not just a sound. If I put silicon earplugs in or earbuds and music I can still feel the vibration. Sometimes it oscillates and other times it is a steady, higher pitched hum. 

I hear it and feel it in the car when the engine is off, and in the house. 

I hear and feel it in the daytime as well, but there is more ambient noise in the house during the daytime, so it is less bothersome<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes. At first I thought it was worse in the winter when leaves were not on the trees. Then I discovered that this wasn't the fact. The hum was very common last year, and less so this year. It went from happening most of the day and night, to about 7 nights per month recently. 

I contacted the city and was told that there is no department to handle such issues.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Around once per second on average<br>

<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> No<br>
<b>Please list any unusual geographic, geological, or other features in your area:</b> There are caves. 

There is fracking going on, drilling for oil too.<br>
<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Left<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> My husband does not sense it. 

I can feel the pressure waves as a slowly oscillating pressure vibration. 

A hospital went in about 5 blocks away around the time that the sound started. There is a freeway there as well. I thought it might be road sounds, but then during very slow traffic time or during snow storms when the roads are pretty much empty, the vibration may still be present.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> a really low frequenzy humming, like 10 trucks idling in a distance. first i thought its from a generator or pump on a cronstrcution site across the street, then i thought its caused by a railway bridge or some kind of other work site. i got up in the middle of the night to find the source but everytime i opened my window or my door the hum was gone. back in the bed i could hear it again. however if i go to another room during the night (my beedroom is the most north room of my flat, living room most south), the humming is way more subtle than in my bedroom.
i first noticed it around september 2012, then it disappeared and came back. there is no pattern behind it, its either there or not. usually the hum starts around 1:30 am to 2:30 and ends around 5am, mo-su. there can be several breaks during the night but usually it starts and doesnt stop. again no pattern.
another idea was a newly built tunnel underneath my feet but the appearence of the hum did not match neither the start of the drilling nor the official opening. (actually they started to build the tunnel like 4 years ago so it cant be it). i now can sleep because i open a window during the night. because of the ongoing noise of the city i cant notice the hum anymore.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> yes it does. its pure chance that its there and so is the end of it.<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> what you should ask:

- if people actually went to a doctor because of this. i was close to it before i discovered this site by pure chance thanks to the TIL section of reddit.
- if people are capeable of hearing transistors. you can easily hear them if you mute a new flatscreen tv. (only the led type, plasma is a projection, they work different) they still make some noise if muted, these are the transistors. if you switch channels you hear them even better. you should ask this because it requires a certain kind of attention, so in my opinion you can reduce false positives with this question. 
- a checkbox grid with ideas/sources that people thought is causing this. like "what were the sources you thought of: construction site, railway, fans etc"<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> A low hum, like a machine, can be closely replicated by a man humming E flat. (I know this because I can replicate the noise very closely by humming as low as I possibly can, and with a piano the note is e flat.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Yes. It is not constant. I've only ever heard it at night. It has never woken me up, as it is not loud enough. Indoors it is loudest, and it is almost imperceptible when I move around to look for the source. I have to stop moving and there must be silence or near-silence in order to hear it. When moving it dulls, and when someone else talks it is usually drowned out. I have had my hearing checked and it is close to perfect, and I do not have tinnitus. When outside it is much quieter and when in a vehicle it disappears.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>

<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> <br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> None.<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I would just like to point out that in terms of credibility, I am quite credible as I have heard it many times when no one else could. There is no history of mental illness in my family and I have near-perfect hearing. I have searched for the source of the noise and found none, which is what brought me here today. I am quite curious as to what could be the cause, amnd mnow I am quite elated to learn that it is not "just me".<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I don't live there any more, so I have to do this from memory (moved out a year ago, lived there for four years and heard the humming all that time). Just a very deep humming, kind of like heavy machinery in a distant room.. but maybe more like... ok, this needs some explaining: in my parents house the bathroom was all solid concrete, and really echoed. It has this funny feature that if you hummed at just the right pitch, you would hit some kind of resonance frequency that very loudly amplified it. This always reminded me of that, like a room amplifying the noise.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It didn''t happen every night, only some. It fades in and out over the course of tens of seconds at unpredictable intervals, but persisting for at least a few hours (it has never kept me awake longer than that).<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> Little effort<br>

<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> Sleep disturbances<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> Sudden deafness in the left ear, with tinnitus, but in the middle range of tones (not the range where I heard the hum). Also, the tinnitus is only noticable in quiet environments, and there is a clear correlation between exposure to loud noises during the day and intensity of tinnitus before going to sleep. I have never found any correlation between it and the hum, though.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Extremely low humming sound noticeable in every room and every floor of the house, including basement. First noticed about a year ago. Thought it might be hearing sensitivity late at night when ambient noise is at its lowest level. The hum disappears as soon as I step outside. Ruled out any running appliances. Thought it could be just constant flow of electricity to all outlets in the house causing low hum through wires. Have not yet cut all power at the main breaker to test this theory. Haven't noticed the hum anywhere other than my home.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> Not sure because I'm not always listening for it. Seems like it's not always present though because it is just so noticeable at other times. No one else in my home can be sure if they have ever heard the hum. They say they don't hear it when I seem sensitive to it.<br>

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Shortly before I started hearing the hum, there was road construction, involving a jackhammer, being performed outside my bedroom window. With the windows closed the hammering was reduced to a gentle hum. I woke up one day around 4 am, heard the familiar humming and complained to my girlfriend that it was unreasonable for the workers to be using a jackhammer so early in the morning. She informed me the construction was completed and she heard nothing. I opened the window to check on the site, and she was right, there was no work going on whatsoever.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Like a constant reverberation. sometimes it has a rythm -more of a pattern- and that's when it becomes annoying because I can notice it more. For the longest time I thought it was the aquarium pump. I have an aquarium downstairs and it uses a 700 gallon per hour pump. I thought maybe its vibration, as quiet as it is, was probably propagating through the walls all the way to the second floor. My wife thought I was crazy as she said she never hears it. The day that it really hit me was when the power went completely off due to a downed power line. We were without power for over 8 hours and absolutely nothing was on at the house, and I could still hear it at night.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> This is the part that I don't really know. Let me say it in terms of, I can't FEEL it during any other time except for night time. As if I have to be relaxed and in bed in order for me to hear it. Therefore, maybe it's there all the time and I don't feel it due to the conditions and other noises around me, or maybe it is only perceivable at late night.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> More than twice per second<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> In house upstairs<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>

<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> None. As matter of fact, last time I was tested at a lab experiment over at GaTech, I was classified as having above average hearing (2 points below the lowest frequency detected by average population)<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> Not at the moment, except that I am VERY glad I found this site as I have stopped telling people about this thinking I was the only person who could hear it or if I was having a some sort of psychological problem.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> The sound itself is like a beehive but less sharp sounding and more purr sounding, if that makes any sense. The description on the other page mentioned it sounds like a truck to some people, I can understand that comparison but it sounds different than a truck to me. Similar, but not quite the same. I'm not sure it sounds like anything else I've heard before.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> It sets on quickly, like driving into a thick fog. Suddenly it's very loud and I sit upright to hear it better. No matter what I'm doing, I notice it. Usually once I hear it, I start listening for it then I sort of lose track of it and it fades away. Even then I hear it for a minute at a time, usually a few times a day, and more times at night or after dark.<br>

<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> it was around 1:00AM, Friday June 21st....it was stormy (rain, wind and lightning), I don't recall hearing thunder. The ac was on which makes a sound. All of a sudden I heard a noise a tad bit louder than then ac. I listened carefully, and to me it sounded like a plane but I knew it couldn't be a plane at that time, so I thought maybe it was a helicopter, but it wasn't getting louder or quieter, it was constant. It kind of freaked me out because it wasn't going away, so I woke my boyfriend up and asked if he could hear an engine and he said no, he didn't hear anything. I don't know how long it lasted because I eventually fell asleep after 30 or so minutes of waiting for it to go away.

Second time which is happening at this very moment at 11:30AM Sunday June 23rd, sounds the same as the first time.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It is a dull 'hum' but a powerful sound nonetheless.  I have been describing it to my girlfriend that it is the sound of night. I have always remembered this sound at night, although I only remember hearing it in my town in northern Minnesota.   The sound is peaceful, but somewhat eerie as to the origin of it. I associate the hum more with the summer months.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> <br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very distracting low hum, similar to a distant lorry engine, and definitely more clear inside my house than when I go outside.<br>

<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> I never really thought anything of it at first- assuming there was some sort of thing happening every night with a lorry maybe round the corner, but when i realised it stopped when i went out for a smoke, i started searching for what it was inside, or if the walls were vibrating or humming, and then asked my brother if he could hear it and he couldn't hear a thing. Then i thought i had something wrong with my hearing and basically tried to ignore it- until i saw a post about 'The Hum' on Reddit.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Deep throbbing hum. It pulses slowly, and sounds kind of electric. It's quite near some power lines, but I've investigated, and it doesn't appear to be directly coming from them. It's also quite near at train yard, but it's not coming from there, either.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I have heard two separate and distinct noises over time.  One seems to match the description of the massive diesel engine in the distance.  It was loud enough for me to consider calling the police to report it.  I assumed there was a massive municipal project that needed to be accomplished at night, and tried to forget about it.  I was alone at the time of the incident, and had nobody else in my proximity to verify the noise.  It was more than loud enough to keep me awake.

The second noise I have heard, a noise that was also heard by another 19 year old male friend of mine is more frequent.  It is a higher pitch than the noise described above.  It sounds like a very faint tornado siren(I understand this noise is different in many areas).  We have heard this particular noise on many occasions.  I can not confirm the weather in these situations, but on a gut instinct, I would say it was generally overcast with no rain.  I have no specific memory of ever hearing this noise on a clear or rainy night.

Noise 2: - various locations including but not limited to
Hall Road and Utica Road
Shelby Township, Michigan<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I only hear it in my kitchen, which is on the ground floor, and my office on the second floor, and it's a sustained wwwwWWWWWWUBwwwwwwWWWWWWUB sort of noise. It sounds like distant ongoing bass or vibrations, though I never feel the corresponding sensation that accompanies bass. 

I never heard of the hum before reading a random story about it, and I had never heard the hum before moving into my new house back in August, 2012. We have some noisy neighbours who like to play loud music, so at first I though maybe they were playing something quietly, but it goes on for hours or days.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It began as an annoyance; we've experienced issues with our air conditioning unit and I originally assumed it was our unit. However, the sound was louder near the front door of my apartment so I did some investigating.. I turned off all appliances, electronics and the a/c. I still heard the Hum, and it resembled what a large fridge or deep freeze sounds when it runs. Very low pitched and very soft. My partner could not hear it.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I've heard this on several different occasions. It's a throbbing hum, almost a gyrating sound, like a point is spinning and causing the ebbing sound. As that point spins in a circle it gets farther away but comes back around to be louder. I'm sorry the wording isn't the best, but it's what the sound reminded me of. Sort of like a bottle on a string being swung around in a circle, but not fast, just enough to get a steady sound. I was watching Netflix when the sound started, so I looked out the window, it was really dark outside, not much wind. I stepped onto my balcony and it got quieter, so I went back into my room and there it was, just as loud. It was a beautiful night though. And I'd heard the sound at previous locations all around Alberta though I can't remember the exact locations.<br>

It makes it so that I can't sleep while its going though... I automatically focus too much on it.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> <br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It is a humming vibration that has a quick frequency that randomly changes the speed of frequency at a minor but noticeable scale. It is quite Low, but the pitch rises up when the speed of frequency changes, it usually throbs and that also changes the pattern of the hum.<br>

<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> I'm not a robot for sure, heheh. Human ? With days like today in society, no one is a human. Well I always hear the Hum whenever I'm in various areas of Florida orlando, mostly in my home and at school and at parking lots or after getting off elevators. It is very strong when I'm inside a building, and at Night it is a rarity for the hum to not happen, the times that the hum most likely at night is 7-8 pm or 12- 2 am. It use to be very common and almost happened once a day when I was younger, my memory is spotty but, I'm sure this started after Third grade. Now I believe the reason for the hum to not affect me as much today, is only because when I wear headphones and play music, usual blends with the hum and I get to focus on other things other than paying attention to it, so actually it's as common as ever, just not paid attention to. It happened me last night as well, and I've noticed that the way I tilt my head changes the sound and sometimes 'scares' it away. The throbing parts of the hum gives me headaches, and I am already naturally suicidal but I will not hold back that the hum makes it easier to feel 'dead' and not in control, but the hum is a short happening the max time I ever experienced it was ten minutes. That's all I believe I can share with you.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> It's a year-round droning/rumbling sound, and it's easier to hear during winter.

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low humming sound, like a diesel train engine running at moderate to full speed.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I find this is most noticeable laying in bed, probably because it is the most quiet then. The sound will momentarily stop when other noises overtake it (wife talking, moving head on pillow). As soon as that noise stops, the hum increases in volume again. Note that the hum doesn't actually continue during this secondary noise event... it actually pauses (like muting a TV) and resumes when the noise stops.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> I have heard industrial electrical transformers, or electrical motors make a similar noise. If you've ever heard the windings on a motor vibrate, usually if the motor is just starting to rotate, or is jammed stationary, this would be the closest analog I could use to describe it.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> I only notice it at night, or early in the morning, in my bedroom. The sound drops significantly as you move away from that corner of the house. I've investigated the PIG transformer on the pole next to my property, the drop and meter to my house (the electrical drop is right next to the bedroom window), the breaker panel, in my garage (below my bedroom), and my neighbor's AC condenser, which is on the side of her house next to mine, and my bedroom. None of these things produce any significant vibration in the air or the ground, or to the touch, that matches the hum. The neighbors AC condenser has been ruled out because the hum can be there without the condenser running.

I've also eliminated my tinitus, as my fiancee hears it too, at the same time as I.

I don't notice it during the day, ever. Windows open or closed has no effect. I haven't heard it outside, but I haven't investigated outside at night.

I do notice a lot of distant vibration does effect my house, such as trucks or traffic from about 1/4 mile away, while lying in my bed. With one ear down on the bed and a window open, I can match vibration through the ground and sound from the distance.

I've noticed it the year I moved into the house, winter, 2011. The house is a raised ranch built around 1976. The hum is omni directional when in the north west corner of the house. It fades drastically when you move away from there.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>

A few times, including this morning, it has been so loud as to wake me up..but the sound is not in the room, it is inside my head. I asked my (adult) son if he could hear it and he said no..I raised my hand when I could hear it and lowered it when it stopped but he couldn't hear anything. I do not hear it in the garden or at work, or anywhere else. Trying to go to sleep is hard as it seems so loud from the pillow.  Feel rather relieved to have come across this as I felt rather worried and alone.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> At night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Low hum, as if a distant motorized generator is running.  It can vary sometimes, and not remain constant.  At first, it was barely discernible.  But as the years went by, it got louder and now it can be heard during daytime but infrequently.<br>

<b>When is the sound the loudest?:</b> Same day and night<br>
<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Very loud hum resembling a B-52 flying overhead or a large cruise ship engine. The hum seems to come from a swath of space approximately 60 degrees in width, sometimes seemingly eminating from the mountains themselves, sometimes sounding like it is coming from the air directly above the mountains. At some points in time/locations the hum sounds like it is coming from all directions.

The hum is always there, only this one particular spot in the mountains. I've visited the location around 10-15 times and have spent time from sun up to sundown there, always with the hum.

The hum loudness will fluctuate slightly throughout the day, estimating something between 60% of volume to max of 100% volume.

No matter how close I get to the apparant source I can never locate it.

If I place earphones over my ears (with no sound coming from the earphones), the hum will deaden, or reduce in volume by approximately 50%.

I'm fairly certain the vibration from the hum can be felt throughout my body.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever stop? Please tell us about this.:</b> The sound has never stopped during any period I have been in the area.

The hum will however dissapear fairly rapidly as I move from the general area. It only seems to occur in about a 1-2 sq mi area.<br>
<b>Does the sound ever &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;throb&quot;?:</b> Steady tone/hum<br>
<b>Where is it the loudest?:</b> Outside<br>
<b>Have you tried tracking down the source of the noise?:</b> With great effort<br>
<b>When did you start hearing it?:</b> 2011<br>
<b>Can you provide a precise date when you first noticed it? (If &quot;No&quot;, then leave blank):</b> no<br>

<b>Does your home have a &quot;smart meter&quot;?:</b> Not sure<br>

<b>Which is your dominant hand?:</b> Right<br>
<b>Your gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Please enter your age (just a single number, no words please):</b> 30<br>
<b>Medical complaints from The Hum (check all that apply):</b> none<br>
<b>Please list other cities where you have heard it:</b> no other cities. I travel almost year-round throughout the western US and have never encountered the hum either before or after this discovery.<br>
<b>Do you have any medical issues with your hearing?:</b> no<br>
<b>Did we forget to ask anything? Do you have any other information or details for the project?:</b> This hum is very noticable. Much more so than most other reports I have read. It is not near any sort of human interference, and extremely remote.

It should be possible to record this hum quite clearly due to it's volume and consistent nature.

Please contact me at prospector1745@hotmail.com if you need further info or investigate it personally. I've been extremely curious what the sound is. I have a BS in physics and a good bit of geologic self taught knowledge so I may be of assistance.
Located on the northern slope of the Mohave Mt's, apprx 10 NE of Lake Havasu City, AZ in a large canyon/dry wash bed. No human habitation or features nearby. Extremely remote and rough terrain, accessible only by 4x4 up a dry wash. Very few people access this particular area, despite being relatively nearby to a city - due to remoteness, steepness, and lack of roads or hiking trails.<br>

<b>Please describe the sound:</b> Usually it's a low, resonating hum. But the sound is different when it's overcast during the day, it's very tonal and harmonious on those days. But it's harder to hear and the sound pulses: it gets loud and then quiet but at an even pace.<br>
