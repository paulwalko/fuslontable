<b>Summary:</b> Costa Rica’s Banco Popular (or BPDC by its Spanish acronym) is a public-like cooperative bank that is worker-owned and controlled, with the mission to serve the social and sustainable welfare of Costa Rican. Its clients include workers, peasants, micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, and communal, cooperative, and municipal development associations. Any worker holding a savings account for over a year has the right to share ownership. BPDC has a democratic assembly made up of 290 representatives selected from among the bank’s member-owners. The assembly advises on strategic direction and selects four of the seven board members, with the other three appointed by the government. The bank also requires that 50 percent of board members are women.  BPDC combines commercial and developmental functions such that earning financial returns is placed on a par with serving the environmental and social good. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://neweconomics.org/2017/05/cabfair" target="_blank">Cabfair: a cooperative owned alternative to Uber</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Cabfair is a proposed driver-owned minicab firm and ride-hailing app being created by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) that will provide an ethical, co-operative alternative to Uber. This platform is just one of many Uber alternatives being created across Europe and the US. It can be seen as part of the broader platform cooperativism movement which aims to decentralize the power of apps, protocols, and websites, allowing low income communities to benefit from the shift of labour markets to the Internet.

<b>Summary:</b> Malawi Tea 2020 was developed by the Tea Association of Malawi (TAML), Oxfam, IDH (the Sustainable Trade Initiative), and GIZ (German Development Agency) to bring together stakeholders from across the entire tea value chain to create a just tea industry that can sustain living wages for workers and living incomes for smallholders, while remaining globally competitive. In total, 21 actors entered a Memorandum of Understanding in 2015, and are working towards a common roadmap of activities across the sector. Achievements include: a new wage-setting process with worker representation through collective bargaining between TAML and the Plantation Agricultural Workers Union (PAWU); wage increases for tea workers, which are now 40% more than the minimum wage; local savings groups in tea communities to provide additional income to smallholder farmers; as well as non-financial benefits, such as improved nutrition. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> The Ethical Trading Company (Etico) is an association of small farmers, companies, consumers and charities aimed at producing high-quality products while improving the quality of life of producer communities through fair trading practices, joint analysis of costs, sharing of information, and trusting relationships.  Cooperatives and charities are invited to buy shares of Etico, giving farmers an opportunity to own a portion of the supply chain. Profits from the business operations are reinvested in smallholder farmers through the charities and cooperatives.  These investments assist farmers in improving quality of produce, infrastructure, and social and ecological sustainability. Some examples include construction of cupping laboratories for coffee growers, loans to enable land ownership, facilitation of honey production to avoid deforestation and reduce pesticide use, and cattle purchases to diversify livelihood strategies.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> SEWA Sangini Child Care Workers’ Cooperative (SCCWC) was developed as a response to SEWA workers’ requests for quality childcare provision. SCCWC child care centres are owned jointly by the care providers and the mothers of the children. The board of SCCWC is comprised of cooperative members and is elected every 3-5 years. The board manages activities and any issues that arise during the parent-teacher meetings or care provider meetings; ensures that financial regulations are observed; and sets nominal fees which parents pay each month, but operation costs are subsidised by SEWA, donors and local government. The SCCWCs are also unique in the fact that they offer an integrated care approach so that children receive basic education and social skills, adequate nutrition, and health services. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://cles.org.uk/tag/the-preston-model/" target="_blank">Preston Model</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> After the financial crisis of 2007/8 Preston, a city in Lancashire, UK, lost half of its government grants and nearly a billion pounds (US$1.3 bn) in private investments. In order to revitalise local businesses, Preston reoriented its plans towards a community wealth project. In partnership with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES), the project is centred on several large anchor institutions (e.g. the local hospital), who shift their procurement practices from external to local sources, bringing money back into the Preston economy. Simultaneously, the project developed worker cooperatives to create enterprises to address identified gaps in local supply capacity, supporting a local cooperative economy. Preston continues to explore alternative ways of bringing wealth back into the community, such as through a windfarm for local energy generation and redirection of pension investments to the regional economy. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> Catalan Integral Cooperative (CIC) is a network of consumer and service cooperatives based in Catalonia, Spain as well as an activist project. CIC integrates economic alternatives, such as peer-to-peer exchange, social currency, protection of economic activity between the associate cooperatives, and reduction of individualised liability. Liability is reduced through the legal cooperative framework: individual debts of the members cannot be claimed from the cooperatives and the debts of the cooperative cannot be claimed from the members. Furthermore, the CIC has set up a series of entities, whose legal form allows its self-employed members to issue invoices, usually a process requiring a prohibitively expensive license. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> Launched in 2008 Cleveland-based institutions (e.g. the Cleveland Foundation, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the municipal government), the Evergreen Cooperative Initiative creates living-wage jobs in six low-income neighbourhoods of Cleveland. Rather than training workers for employment that doesn’t exist, it focuses on building a local economy by catalysing new cooperative businesses. Examples include Evergreen Energy Solutions, Green City Growers and the Evergreen Cooperative Laundry. The initiative thus starts by creating jobs, and then recruiting and training local residents to fill them. The model has been successful in creating new cooperatives, redirecting local profits to local communities, preventing outsourcing, giving ownership to employees, and further consolidating profits within the community.

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="http://botswanawatch.org/?p=500" target="_blank">Marange Development Trust</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> In 2008, the Zimbabwean government and private companies began mining in the Marange diamond fields, displacing communities throughout the region. In 2015, several of these companies were united to form the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC). With the help of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA), two communities founded their own organisations to combat the negative impacts of mining, including the Marange Development Trust (MDT). They began by monitoring the mining companies’ operations and gathered information on violations. In August 2017, the MDT filed a lawsuit against the ZCDC, on the grounds that it had not conducted an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The lawsuit was ultimately successful, with the ZCDC forced to halt operations pending approval of an EIA certificate, and to enter a memorandum of understanding with the affected community. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://www.fsg.org/publications/shaping-inclusive-markets" target="_blank">Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited (GCMMF)</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Gujarati smallholder dairy farmers, once exploited by milk traders, now control one of India’s largest food product businesses. Starting in 1945, dairy farmers, with help from the leaders of the Indian Independence movement, started to organise. Through public protests, the farmers gained rights to supply the Bombay Milk Scheme and formally registered as the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union. Further successes include leasing of part of a government creamery, which secured market access, the lobbying of the government to limit butter imports so that the Union could supply the local market, and the development of other milk products under the “Amul” brand. In 1973, the Union joined with other cooperatives to form the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited (GCMMF), which inherited the Amul brand. Since 1940, dairy farmers have successfully negotiated so that they now receive over 70% of market price of dairy products. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> Over the past 60 years, Kenya’s tea industry has transformed from large estates to smallholder farms. Smallholders pooled their resources through strong federated bodies to build economies of scale and succeed in competitive markets. They organised to analyse the value-chain; identified areas of perceived weakness; and addressed and rebranded their product in response. They were aided by a combination of new technology platforms, such as mobile money, and a supportive political environment—a nationalist government that halted the expansion of larger multinational players, creating space for the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), the smallholder tea initiative. Kenyan tea now commands a price premium compared to international competitors; it constitutes a major part of foreign exchange earnings; and 70% of the export value of tea is distributed to smallholders at the community level.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> The Bronx-based, worker-owned Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA) employs more than 2,200 staff, originally unemployed women or low-paid workers, and stands as the largest worker cooperative in the United States. Eight employees are represented in the Board, thus, taking part directly into decision-making processes through their home care experiences. CHCA also employs ‘peer mentors’ and trains its supervisors to be coaches rather than disciplinarians. With its affiliate PHI, CHCA provides free trainings to hundreds of women trainees each year and guarantees secure employment. By doing this they counter an industry paradigm that regards direct-care staff as temporary, low paid and easily replaceable. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> Once Again Nut Butter is a 100% employee-owned company with an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The company is also governed as a worker-owned cooperative. The company functions on the basis of fair compensation: income that is generated in the business is distributed at a 4:1 compensation ratio of highest to lowest paid employees and profit-sharing bonuses are distributed equally to all owners. The employee-owners meet on a regular basis and have a vote on how the company is managed. Company meetings address the company policies, operational issues, and financial strategies. Committees are also formed to help resolve issues, which are subject to a final company vote (1 person = 1 vote). At upper management, there are at least 3 employee-owners sitting on the Board of Directors. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> The Buen Vivir Fund seeks to promote financial models and practices that support communities’ holistic wellbeing, as opposed to focusing on maximizing capital accumulation. In early 2018, the Buen Vivir Fund launched its first round of investments to support nine unique projects led by organisations across Latin America, North America, Southern Africa, and South Asia. The Buen Vivir Fund investment model identifies lending practices developed by grassroots groups that are already proving effective on the ground, and then working collaboratively with them to uplift and apply these practices to the level of a global investment fund. Investors and on-the-ground experts have equal voting rights in decision-making; loan terms shift risk away from the small grassroots groups investees; borrowers make a solidarity contribution of their choosing based on the rate of growth and success of projects<br>

<b>Summary:</b> LETS - Local Exchange Trading Systems or Schemes allow people to exchange goods and services with one another in a local, co-created currency which can only be spent within the LETS group. Each group trades in its own currency and a record of transactions is kept by an accountant.  The balances, which always add up to zero, are made available to the members with a listing of what is offered and wanted within the network.  Detailed rules are decided by elected officers, who also carry out all the other tasks and planning. There are several LETS throughout the UK. For example, in Brighton, UK, skilled tradespeople and community members trade skills, services and goods through the Bright Exchange.  “Brights” is the local currency, managed online, and each service is worth a certain number of “Brights”. Feedback cites a more cohesive and inclusive community, with opportunities to learn and share skills. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> Banco Palmas is one of the early examples of what has been termed solidarity finance. Emerging from an urban slum in Brazil, this initiative is based on three key pillars: small, community-sanctioned loans; local currency (to keep wealth circulating within the neighbourhood); and professional training (to generate local entrepreneurship and a skilled workforce). Banco Palmas created participatory deliberative and decision-making spaces: Local Socioeconomic Forum, Management Council, and Block Councils. The impact of Banco Palmas has gone well beyond Conjunto Palmeiras; it has prompted the creation of a network of community-based banks across Brazil and is at the forefront of technological innovation on e-currencies and other financial instruments such as credit cards backed by social currencies.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> In Liberia, the Citizen Helpdesks work to address accountability challenges related to large gold mining concessions. Community Frontline Associates selected by communities and led by local journalists are trained in community engagement, constructive dialogue techniques and methodologies for data collection and analysis.  They work with affected communities to understand key issues and community concerns in relation to mining operations, and assist communities in acting upon Mineral Development Agreements (MDAs).  MDAs establish incentives, payments, and responsibilities between the mining company, the government, and the community, but the language is legalistic and technical, and ordinary citizens have little knowledge as to what they permit and restrict. The goal is to use the information generated from community members to better inform future decision-making, ensure fair treatment of community members, and build trust and accountability among communities, government and the mining company.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> W. L. Gore and Associates is a privately-held multinational company founded in 1958. Since its founding, it has operated through a "lattice" system of employee self-management which is said to verge on true workplace participatory democracy. Key features include a flat hierarchy in which the CEO is elected, self-managed work teams with small team sizes to secure ownership in collective decision-making, and free information flow. "Associates" (as the workers are known) step forward to lead when they have the expertise to do so; a practice referred to as "knowledge-based decision-making".<br>

Based on an alternative currency, the Puma, the scheme supports collective decision-making, localised consumption and the redeployment of under-utilised skills and competencies. Since no interest is paid on 'pumas', the system encourages exchange rather than accumulation and wealth maximisation.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> Jubilee 2000 was a highly successful global campaign to bring about debt relief for developing countries, which galvanised activists into a shared global project and brought them into negotiations with creditors. The Jubilee campaign lodged the concept of odious debt in the public consciousness. Its successes proved that debt relief was not only economically and politically feasible, but also could lead to desirable social outcomes.

<b>Summary:</b> The People’s Credit Cooperative Society (Koperasi Kredit Rakyat (KKR)) was founded in 1975 in the rural town of Batang Berjuntai, Malaysia, to improve the socio-economic status of estate and mine workers through their increased involvement in economic activities. Funds are mobilised through members’ savings, and support KKR’s economic projects such as group insurance schemes, income generating activities, and community credit unions that provide financial services to members.  KKR therefore links savers and borrowers in the same community. Members participate in the governance of the credit unions through the Area Committee and its sub committees, which meet on a monthly basis. At the annual General Meeting members have a chance to elect members of sub-committees and voice any concerns with the wider cooperative community. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="http://www.csm4cfs.org/the-csm/" target="_blank">Civil Society Mechanism to the UN Committee on CFS</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> The Civil Society Mechanism (CSM), an autonomous unit of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), is the largest space for civil society organisations working on food security and nutrition. Civil society has a formally guaranteed right of participation, rather than just observer status, including representatives of: smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, agricultural and food workers, landless, women, youth (among others). Policy working groups (WGs) provide a space for dialogue and information exchange amongst these organisations, to develop strong policy positions. Of particular relevance is the Connecting Smallholders to Markets WG, which provides information on the experience of small-scale producers’ organizations, consumers and the urban poor, and has highlighted the importance of informal, territorial markets (rather than assuming all smallholder farmers needed to be connected to more distant formal markets). <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://practicalaction.org/renewable-energy-for-refugees" target="_blank">RE4R</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Renewable Energy for Refugees (RE4R) was developed to reduce the cost of energy provision for refugees living in displacement camps in Jordan and Rwanda. The majority of refugees and displaced people do not have access to reliable energy sources and those that do typically have to spend a large portion of their yearly budget on fuel. The RE4R project helps refugees and their communities to access finance, training, technology, and expertise to develop their own renewable energy sources.  The aim of RE4R is to enable entrepreneurs to grow and move from reliance on aid to economic independence by making renewable energy a key element of services provided to displaced communities. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/integrated-waste-management-brazil/">Engagement of informal workers’ organisations in policy-making</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> The integration of the informal waste workers (catadores) of Belo Horizonte within the city's selective waste collection scheme began with the founding of the first association of catadores, ASMARE, in 1990. While initial NGO support was catalytic, the catadores were then able to form their own collectives and voice their own demands. The change from working in the streets with no organization into the semi-formality of associations supported empowerment, improvements in working and living conditions, and greater self-esteem; foundations for later development including a formal role in policy and ownership of recycling facilities.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> The Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Markets (ESFIM) programme aimed to support national farmers' organisations (in Benin, Bolivia, Costa Rica, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Peru, Philippines, Uganda, and Uruguay) to use evidence in their advocacy processes. Through the programme, farmers identified their advocacy objectives, set up an action plan, and gained access to local experts to analyse key issues and strengthen the evidence base of their proposals. These processes were carried out in a collaborative and participatory way with the members of the farmers' organisations.<br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="https://www.sparkmicrogrants.org/" target="_blank">Spark MicroGrants</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Spark MicroGrants was founded in 2010 to promote community-driven development. The Spark Approach is based on six key phases: community building, goal setting, proposal development, technical advisor review, implementation, and future envisioning. Each Spark process begins with a local university graduate who enters the facilitator fellowship programme. Over the course of two years, each facilitator works with seven communities through the phases. The community, facilitator, and external experts work together to design and implement a community development plan using a microgrant from Spark, with projects in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, enterprise, education and health. In the last phase, communities generate a plan for continuing their project independently. Part of this final phase also includes networking and relationship building with local governments, NGOs, and businesses. 94% of Spark MicroGrants projects are self-sustaining and demonstrate the success of the approach. <br>

<b>Case Title:</b> <a href="http://www.csplatformghana.org" target="_blank">Economic Governance Platform </a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> The Economic Governance Platform (previously known as Civil Society Platform on the IMF Bailout) is a coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) that came together to advocate for civil society inclusiveness in major public financial management issues and in particular the IMF negotiations as well as the implementation of the final agreement. The initiative was supported by Oxfam in Ghana, who believed that ordinary Ghanaians should not shoulder the burden of needed structural and economic reforms. Through the platform, a diverse coalition of CSOs and think tanks worked together to facilitate a participatory deliberation process to agree on common advocacy messages; supported civil society monitoring of public sector spending; and also linked to global initiatives as levers for top-down influence. It led to CSO consultation being instituted as an integral part of the negotiation process, protection of pro-poor spending and the setting of transparency and accountability measures to address the underlying causes of indiscipline in public spending. <br>

<b>Summary:</b> RSF Social Finance is an innovative public benefit financial services organisation dedicated to transforming the way the world works with money. RSF offers investing, lending, and giving (i.e. grants) services to individuals and enterprises committed to improving society and the environment. Since 1984, RSF has given out more than $285 million in loans and more than $100 million in grants. RSF is unique in that it holds quarterly pricing meetings for its borrowers and investors to discuss and influence what the interest and spread rates should be, rather than use the commonly-accepted LIBOR rates. Each participant discusses their interests—investors talk about their motivations, borrowers talk about their use of the loan, and RSF discusses the resources needed for them to work as an intermediary, and together the group gains insight into each other’s financial needs, priorities, and plans.<br>

<b>Summary:</b> The Citizens' Economic Council Programme explores how citizen voice can be embedded in macro-economic policy processes such as setting interest rates or making budget decisions. Deliberation processes, educational tools and technical support build people's understanding and strengthen their voice. Economically excluded communities are reached, through an 'economic inclusion roadshow', with access support, e.g. for people with disabilities or those who face language barriers.
