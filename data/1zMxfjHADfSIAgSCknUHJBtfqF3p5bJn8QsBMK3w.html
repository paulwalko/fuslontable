<b>Country:</b> Argentina<br>
<b>Description:</b> Facing the place where new land will rise in the Atlantic Ocean, between the tips of South America and Africa, when the Antarctic plate tips to accommodate compression of plates in the Pacific during the hour of the shift, Argentina will find itself with a great deal of displaced water eeking 
its level. The flood tide will assault the coastline, under the immense pressure that a large volume of water can produce, not a wave but a body of water at a high level, and thus taking some time to disburse.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Uruguay<br>
<b>Description:</b> We have described a rush of water coming toward this part of the S American coastline during the shift, due to the tipping up of the Antarctic Plate to form new land between the tip of S America and South Africa. Uruguay is lowland, and with tides 500-600 feet would suffer even without this added rush of water<br>

<b>Country:</b> Bolivia<br>
<b>Description:</b> Bolivia lies at the heart of the South American plate, thus is old rock not likely to shatter. This will be pushed higher in altitude during the shift, but not by much, and the latitude will not be much more distance from the new equator after the shift than before, so life will continue much the same for survivors.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Chile<br>
<b>Description:</b> Chile rises high along the coast of South America, but it is precisely because of these steep cliffs that tidal waves will be unexpectedly large during the pole shift. The water will have nowhere to go, so the press of water behind the lip of the wave will press the water up along the cliffs.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Peru<br>
<b>Description:</b> Peru rides high in the Andes, and will ride higher after the shift due to increasing subduction of plates under the current mountain building ridge. The elevation causes thin air, which many of its residents must already deal with, and as during the hour of the shift some of the Earth's atmosphere gets stripped away temporarily, this may be may be increased to the point of suffocation in the high elevations.<br>

For Panama, of course, there can be no question as it is already threatened by rising seas. Higher points in Central America, the mountains of El Salvador and Nicaragua, are riddled with volcanoes, which will be regularly erupting as the shift approaches and will explode violently during the hour of the shift itself.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Bermuda<br>
<b>Description:</b> It's well known that tidal waves rise up as they approach shore, due to the increasing shallowness of the seabed. The water simply has no where else to go. So it would be assumed that boats could ride out the tidal waves, which ordinarily are simply a larger wave out at sea. However, the drama going on within the oceans during a pole shift is different from normal storms.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Honduras<br>
<b>Description:</b> The lands between the south of Mexico and north edge of Columbia will not fare well during the coming pole shift, due to several factors, all of which are essentially fatal to those living there. First, this fragile land mass separates two oceans, which will be heaving to and fro. The water will wash over and nearly wash away the land due to this. Second, the plates under this land are small and will not hold up well under pressure from nearby larger plates, thus will be subducted or fractured. Third, as the Atlantic widens, the Americas will pull apart, leaving the small plates without their normal supports so that they will sink.<br>

Guatemala lies on the border between the N American Plate and the Caribbean Plate, and thus when either of them move, there is shifting of the ground there.<br>

Where much of Mexico will remain intact after the pole shift, but those portions close to Central America will experience the same destruction from fault line crossing and plate crumbling that Central America and the Caribeaan will experience.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Greenland<br>
<b>Description:</b> Greenland will become a more temperate land after the pole shift, being moved into a position equivalent to the border between Canada and the US today. The glaciers and the massive amount of ice still remaining on Greenland from its days as a former pole will melt, steadily, but will take some decades to completely melt. Meanwhile, the force of rushing water will make habitation there tenuous, but coastal settlements such as fishing villages, high above the rushing rivers and with access to the sea, will fare well.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Iceland<br>
<b>Description:</b> As surprising as it may sound, when Iceland rides on a fault line and today has active volcanoes melting the glaciers with their increasing eruptions, Iceland will not suffer unduly from earthquakes and volcanoes during the shift. This is due to the spread of plates, rather than compression, in Iceland's part of the world during the shift. In the scripted drama that emerged during the hour of the shift, Europe and Africa has been pulling east during the week of rotation stoppage, causing the coastlines along the Atlantic to sink.<br>

<b>Country:</b> United Kingdom<br>
<b>Description:</b> England has traditionally fared well during pole shifts, due to its underlying rock structures. Stonehenge attests to this, sustaining a few sharp jolts but avoiding extended jiggling that is often more destructive of heavy structures. However, the Atlantic is anticipated to widen greatly during the coming pole shift, and this will affect England as well as the islands lying to the west of her. During the week of rotation stoppage, lands bordering the Atlantic, due to the stretch that will occur as the Earth continues to pull East, attempting to continue turning and resisting the stoppage, will drop. In England this will results in a permanent drop of 75 feet. England, however, will not go completely under the waves, but in addition to the stretch, wave action during the shift must be taken into account. At first, during the Earth's rotation stoppage, the waters surrounding England may move north toward the pole. Then, during the shift, the waters will dramatically drop as the Atlantic widens. Here is where the danger lies, as within hours there will be a return of the water, with uncontrolled sloshing and the overall drop in sea level will be apparent! Stay on high ground for at least a day. (Scotland/Wales: http://www.zetatalk6.com/info/tinfx133.htm)<br>

<b>Description:</b> Norway has the same high ground advantage as Sweden, but by bordering the coastline will be assaulted with both tidal waves from the Atlantic's sloshing and higher tides at the poles while the Earth stops rotation for a week.

<b>Description:</b> Hungary lies within several mountain ranges, which will shelter it from waves in the sloshing oceans and seas, and from the howling winds which occur during the shift itself. But the Hungarian peoples will find themselves distressed during the pole shift, as their land is riddled with rivers and small lakes, a factor of being in the foothills of the Alps, draining in major rivers the runoff from these mountains, and being in the main lowland where water pools.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Switzerland<br>
<b>Description:</b> During the hour of the shift there are several forces which will push water across France all the way to the foothills of Switzerland. Since the waters of the mediterranean will also slosh, there can be a clash of water under pressure at the point they are likely to meet, again at the high land of Switzerland. Residents are advised to move inland away from the ravines that could experience tidal bore under these circumstances, into areas where such bores will be countered and blocked and thus iminished in intensity. Switzerland will be well above the waves in the Aftertime, so survivors returning to their homes after the hour of the shift will find themselves positioned to take up ocean fishing on their new island home.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Where ordinarily above the waves, when the waves get larger, Spain will find that land once considered safe is no longer so. During the hour of the shift, stretching of the Atlantic will pull Spain down some 50 feet, so that the coastlines will find flooding and high tides, and water flowing inland along rivers. Many will flee to the mountains in northern Spain, but due to the stretch the Atlantic will undergo, this land will sink, and those flocking there will be living on top of each other after the shift with nowhere else to go.<br>

It is a narrow Peninsula poking into a sea which will slosh, repeatedly, during the shift.

<b>Country:</b> Israel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Israel will suffer during the coming pole shift, but no more than what other countries fringing the Mediterranean suffer. As during the prior pole shift, when the Jewish Exodus occurred, Israel will be on the side of the Earth facing the sun and directly in the path of the 12th Planet's tail as it lashes the Earth - hail, red dust, and the terrifying view of a passing object, slightly glowing.<br>

<b>Description:</b> As with all of Africa, surviving the pole shift is but a small part of the survival picture. Mauritania will fare well geographically after the shift, stretching out along the new Equator, so that it is comfortably in a warm temperate zone. Geological, the land is high enough above sea level so that almost all of Mauritania remains above sea level even after the existing poles have melted. Migrants from the Middle East or Europe may find their way into Africa, seeking a warmer Aftertime climate or more land area as the melting poles swallow much of Europe. All the more reason to stay out of sight and with a low profile, to avoid possible confrontations with avaricious travelers.<br>

Weakened by year of inadequate nutrition, the seed and livestock depleted, they have little to fall back upon. Add to this the numbers barely hanging on due to imported aid, which will stop, and the death rate will be immense and swift. Those to the south will find their numbers increasing due to migration from Europe and Arab lands, pressing survival there on all fronts.

The outcome of these types of battles, in normal times, depends upon how well supplied an army is, but in lean times migrating mercenaries do not fare well.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Mozambique<br>
<b>Description:</b> With access to the ocean, survivors will soon find their best source of food to be in the oceans. After the shift, the burping volcanoes put CO2 into the atmosphere, which is best pulled into vegetation in the great kelp beds in the oceans. Water migrates, spreading nutrients and fish in all directions, so all the oceans eventually rebound, and heartily. Survivors are encouraged to plan for this outcome, becoming familiar with fishing practices, and planning to move toward the coastlines after the shift.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Madagascar<br>
<b>Description:</b> The primary problem Madagascar will experience will be assaults during the shift itself from the Indian Ocean, which will first rise slightly as the week of rotation causes water to migrate toward the pole from the equator, then receive a steady flood tide from the Pacific which will empty it's water from the shortening Pacific into, among others, the Indian Ocean, then sudden drops as India goes under the Hymalayas, and all this turmoil causing roiling waters throughout. Thus, massive flood tides running the water up into the highlands via tidal bore, even to washing over the mountains to the lands on the Africa side of the island, will occur. Many will be washed out to sea, and drown.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Indonesia<br>
<b>Description:</b> Indonesia fares poorly during the coming pole shift, but most of the residents will already be dealing with disasters by the time the shift arrives. As low-lying land, in the main, the steadily softening polar ice will create inundation that the country is poorly prepared to deal with. Now and then a hurricane ravages a coastline and dumps rain inland; now and then a volcano goes into an active burping stage; but overall, most of Indonesia during these times - functions.<br>

<b>Description:</b> New Guinea has high mountains which will remain above water even during the worst of the sloshing that the Pacific can inflict, including the rush of water from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean during the compression of the Pacific basin.

<b>Country:</b> Namibia<br>
<b>Description:</b> The coastline along the volatile Atlantic will find itself well positioned for trade inland. Fishing along the coast will provide a source of food, when dried and salted, to be taken inland. Migrations from Europe, perpetually seeking to find the better life that must be somewhere around the bend, will migrate down the coastline all the way to S Africa, and thus will pass through. This will bring an multi-cultural aura to the area, making the seacoast communities a delight for the young, who will learn from their visitors, many of whom will settle.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Botswana<br>
<b>Description:</b> The highlands of Botswana and Zambia will be considered ideal by those wanting the safety and climate of Africa during the Aftertime, and with enough funds to do this in style. Close to the industrialization of South Africa, at a distance from the steaming equatorial humidity of the Congo, these lands seem dry, arable, defensible, and accessible from a country friendly to the colonialist attitude, South Africa. Thus, these countries are likely to find well stocked and serious visitors preceding the shift, intent on being the dominant force in the region after the shift.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Swaziland<br>
<b>Description:</b> Swaziland is far enough from the coastline and with a high enough elevation that the western 2/3 of the country will do well through both the pole shift tides and the Aftertime rise in sea level to 675 feet above today's elevation. After the pole shift, this small country will find that the ocean front has arrived at its door, so ocean fishing will be an option for the populace.<br>

<b>Country:</b> Australia<br>
<b>Description:</b> Australia will be in a good and bad situation re the pole shift. The western 2/3 will go suddenly under water, due to the plate shared with Indian sliding under the Himalayas. However, the eastern 1/3 along with New Zealand will benefit from this, raising slightly out of the water, gaining land above where the melting ice caps will place sea level within two years after the pole shift.<br>

<b>Country:</b> New Zealand<br>
<b>Description:</b> Where New Zealand will remain well above sea level after the shift and polar melts, it will be subject to the same forces during the shift as all other lands. Tidal waves will assault its coastlines, and where cliffs or mountain ranges lie along a coastline, tidal bore can occur, bringing rushing water to a height not expected. As New Zealand is a land of mountain ranges, stay well inland during the shift, returning to the coastlines only some days after the shift has occurred and the sloshing oceans and high tides have settled.<br>

<b>Country:</b> South Africa<br>
<b>Description:</b> South Africa will fare well after the pole shift, due to it's close location to the new equator and high ground. Being relatively remote as an industrialized country, it may also fare well in retaining some of its technology, being used to relying upon itself rather than others. Some electricity will most likely be generated, and road repairs done. Imported food stuffs will stop after the shift, but with an improved climate and distance from volcanoes, some crop growing will succeed.<br>
