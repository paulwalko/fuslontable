<b>title:</b> One West Palm<br>
<b>narrative:</b> 550 N. Quadrille Blvd. $250 million, 30-story two-tower project with 209,000 square feet of offices, 328 luxury apartments, hotel, retail. Approved by city, awaiting OK by Federal Aviation Administration because these would be tallest buildings in the city. Greene says he is ready to build but that he would cancel the project if the city changes height restrictions and allows a competing office tower on a site zoned for 5 stories near the waterfront.<br>

<b>title:</b> Sail Club<br>
<b>narrative:</b> At the former Sail Club site, 11 acres along Clear Lake, beside the Okeechobee Boulevard approach to downtown, Greene is considering high-rise apartments. He was waiting for the market to harden, as the 330 low-rise Cameron Estates apartments he built next door fill up. The sail club project would cater to a relatively affordable market, he said.<br>

<b>title:</b> The Whitney<br>
<b>narrative:</b> Greene paid just under $25 million in April for the Whitney Building, at 410 Evernia St., which has 139 apartments. The 10-year-old building underwent substantial renovation because it was built with Chinese drywall that turned out to be toxic. Because it was purchased at a discount, he plans to rent out the building at rates competitive with nearby apartments now under construction.<br>

<b>title:</b> Opera Place<br>
<b>narrative:</b> In late 2015 Greene <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/business/palm-beach-billionaire-jeff-greene-buys-opera-plac/npRLf/">snapped</a> up the Opera Place site, a prime, 3.2-acre site at 419 Lakeview Ave. at the entrance to the city, once planned for condos. He paid $24 million for the site, which is zoned for tall, twin towers featuring 1 million square feet of offices, residences, a hotel and shops. So far, no plans in place for it, though.<br>
