<b><i>About a Boy</i></b><br><br>
Rather than teach vocabulary through what she considered boring, unnatural, and ineffective sentences, Sarah Miller,  a teacher of an after-school language enrichment program, decided to read students Nick Hornby's <i>About a Boy</i>.  Because she deemed it important to the plot, Miller did not to skip a scene in which the main character is mocked for not knowing a common euphemism for fellatio.  The children questioned her about the term, and she explained, "It has to do with sex; it involves these two body parts; and [you will] not have to worry about it for a very long time."  She was eventually let go after a parent complained bout her saying "inappropriate things" in class.  Afterward, Miller wrote that "one person's discomfort is another's salvation. No one has ever died from discomfort."<br><br>

<b><i>Kaffir Boy</i></b><br><br>
After a parent complained about a scene in Mark Mathabane's book <i>Kaffir Boy</i>, Burlingame Superintendent Sonny Da Marto ordered teachers to immediately stop teaching it and to collect all copies.  The contentious scene depicts Mathabane running away from a group of starving young boys lined up to be sodomized in exchange for money.  "Resisting peer pressure is one of the toughest things for young people to do...That is the lesson of the prostitution scene.  It's a lesson that seems to be lost on the people who want to censor my book," said Mathabane.  On the district's blog, a mother of an 8th grade student wrote that her child was disturbed by the passage. Superintendent Da Marto ordered copies of the abridged version of the book, which was created specifically for middle school students and excludes the objectionable content.  "I'm very concerned about the morals of our society and that children who don't have support are not prepared emotionally to read it...They're already exposed to violence and sex.  As a public agency, are we going to contribute to it?" Da Marto said at the board meeting following the ban.<br><br>

Parents complained about a policy by which they were allowed to opt their children out of R-rated movies shown in class. Parents felt that the policy led to the harassment of children who were opted out of the viewings. In response to the parents' concerns, the Falcon School District passed a new policy which banned the showing of any such movies. The new policy would allow parents to opt their children in to seeing excerpts of R or PG-13 movies. Mary Louge, co-president of the teacher's union, said that she didn't understand  the "need for extreme censor(ship)," and teachers complained that the policy would make it hard to use films like "Schindler's List" to bring history to life.<br><br>

Despite protests from critics, including many historians and academics, some of the changes include removing Thomas Jefferson from the legacy of the Enlightenment, replacing "free enterprise" with "capitalism," and portraying muckrackers and reformers negatively.<br><br>

A video of Sand Hill-Venable Elementary School students chanting "change has come" and "yes, yes we can," shortly after President Obama's inauguration incited outrage when it was posted on YouTube.

<b>More Climate Change, Less History?</b><br><br>
North Carolina's 2010 curriculum review involved a possible deemphasis of U.S. history and the introduction of a new course dealing with issues like climate change. Some teachers expressed concern that such a move would leave students with a deficient understanding of history. "If our students don't know what happened in world history, and if they don't know what happened in U.S. history from George Washington's presidency all the way up through the Civil War, then they will not be able to grasp the big picture," said Mike Belter, a history teacher. Rebecca Garland of the Department of Public Instruction said, "We are certainly not trying to go away from American history. What we are trying to do is figure out a way to teach it where students are connected to it." The revised standards that emerged did put an emphasis on environmental literacy, but still included two courses of U.S. history.<br><br>

The revelation of emails between former governor Mitch Daniels and his staff prompted allegations that Daniels favored suppressing some viewpoints in schools. Of particular concern, according to an email Daniels sent to the Associated Press, were books authored by controversial historian Howard Zinn. "Zinn, by his own admission a biased writer, purposely falsified American history. His books have no more place in Indiana history classrooms than phrenology or Lysenkoism would in our biology classes or the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' in world history courses."

The organization's lawsuit was joined by 15 parents who want their children to believe that "life is a creation made for a purpose." Said attorney John Calvert, "The state's job is simply to say to students, 'How life arises continues to be a scientific mystery and there are competing ideas about it.'"

<b>Both Positive and Negative Speech?</b><br><br>
Students in many Sacramento-area schools were disciplined in the last week of April 2006 -- the same week that other students were participating in a "Day of Silence" to support gay and lesbian students -- for wearing T-shirts expressing disapproval of homosexuality. "I want other people to know the truth," said Anna Choban, a San Juan High School sophomore who was punished for refusing to take off a shirt with an anti-homosexual saying. San Juan High Principal Dave Terwilliger defended his decision to discipline Choban.

<b>Censorship through Reassignment?</b><br><br>
"In a span of four months, they all but stripped me of my professional existence," said Darryl Adams, who was removed from his positions as newspaper advisor, basketball coach, and football game announcer after he refused to obey his principal's order to remove an editorial from the student newspaper. In response to administrators reassigning and disciplining journalism teachers due to articles in student publications, California passed a bill prohibiting administrators from retaliating against employees who support student speech that administrators dislike. State Senator Leland Yee, who proposed the bill, argued, "Allowing a school administration to censor in any way is contrary to the democratic process and the ability of a student newspaper to serve as the watchdog." Administrators, however, believe they need to be able to maintain discipline in their schools. "(We) have heard numerous situations whereby a teacher has used poor judgment under the guise of freedom of speech," said Laura Preston, legislative advocate for the Association of California School Administrators.

The night before, a classmate and a group of other 8th graders had posted a YouTube video calling her "spoiled," "a brat," and "a slut." After consulting with the district's attorneys, school officials cited "cyber-bullying" concerns, and punished the girl who posted the video with a two-day suspension.  That student took the case to federal court, claiming that the district had violated her free speech rights.  A U.S. District judge ruled in her favor, saying that "to allow the school to cast this wide net and suspend a student simply because another student takes offense to their speech, without any evidence that such speech caused a substantial disruption of the school's activities, runs afoul (of the law)."<br><br>

<b>Stars and Bars Barred</b><br><br>
Harby Junior High School officials confiscated a Confederate flag and a similarly-themed belt buckle from Robert Kaufmann and Marshall Alexander, respectively. Parents questioned why the students could not have Confederate flag items, since the school itself had a display case that held two items with the flag upon them. The items--a pin and a United Daughters of the Confederacy membership certificate--belonged to Grace Ward Harby, for whom the school was named. In an attempt to avoid offending anyone, the school removed the items from the display case. "She wanted those items in that school and she wanted students to ask questions about them so their teachers could teach them about what they meant," said Ron Strybos, who had known Harby.

A student at Cary-Grove High School was arrested after he wrote an essay with a reference to a shooting for a creative writing class. Although there were no specific threats, Allen Lee was charged with disorderly conduct after his teacher became alarmed reading the "disturbing and inappropriate" essay. Lee's father was not happy with the decision to arrest him. "We think they have been too harsh," he said. "Every story has two sides." The arrest came two weeks after the infamous Virginia Tech shooting, and some believed the arrest was driven by that. "You have to wonder whether (the charges were) an overreaction, given the events at Virginia Tech," said Ed Yohnka, a representative of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. Another issue was that Lee was arrested for turning in a homework assignment, something that has historically fallen under "protected speech." Lee was released after police decided he was not a threat.<br><br>

<b>Gay-critical T-Shirt</b><br><br>
Two students at Neuqua Valley High School took their school to court to fight a policy that banned shirts saying "Be Happy, Not Gay." The Alliance Defense Fund argued that "the school cannot silence speech merely because some people find it offensive." School district attorney Jack Canna responded that the policy was intended "to preserve the notion that kids shouldn't make negative or derogatory comments about other students." U.S. District Judge William Hart ruled in favor of the high school, but Alex Nuxoll, one of the students fighting the ban, filed for an injunction. In April 2008 the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Hart's decision. "People do not have a legal right to prevent criticism of their beliefs or for that matter their way of life," said Judge Richard Posner.<br><br>

A few weeks before the speech was to be delivered, however, the district announced it was cancelled. District officials maintained that the cancellation occurred because YAF refused to provide a copy of the speech to the district ahead of time. YAF suspected the cancellation was due to Santorum's conservative views on gay marriage and public education. When the district felt assured that Santorum would focus on leadership and community service, it allowed students to attend to speech with the permission of their parents.<br><br>

Tanya Dixon-Neely, a teacher at North Rowan High School, was suspended without pay after she allegedly verbally attacked a student for criticizing President Obama. The incident sparked a national debate when a video of it went viral. The class was discussing reports that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had bullied a classmate in high school. One of Dixon-Neely's students commented that President Obama had also bullied someone while in school. Eventually, Dixon-Neely asked the student, "Do you realize that people were arrested for saying bad things about Bush?" Many observers interpreted that question as a threat.<br><br>

After the ACLU threatened to sue, an agreement was reached that allowed Ferrell to distribute her materials in the schools.

<b>Anti-Gay Adoption Column Prompts Censorship</b><br><br>
Brandon Wegner authored a school newspaper column which argued against gay adoption. Among other potentially inflammatory statements, Wegner pointed out that, according to the Bible, homosexuality is a sin and that gays "shall surely be put to death." When parents Nick Uttecht and Michael McNelly saw the article, they were appalled. "This is why kids commit suicide," said Uttecht, who first saw the article after his 13-year-old son asked about it. Uttecht talked to the superintendent, who apologized for the column and said, "Proper judgment that reflects school district policies needs to be exercised with articles printed in our school newspaper. Offensive articles cultivating a negative environment of disrespect are not appropriate or condoned by the Shawano School District." The school administration also started removing the column from newspapers. However, there was concern about the implications of the administration's decision. "Hopefully, student journalists don't have to fear they'll be squashed if they take a controversial view...Freedom of speech includes speech about religious viewpoints...Any controversial issue is a lightning rod for censorship," said the First Amendment Center's David Hudson.<br><br>

<b>"I (Heart) Boobies" Bracelet Battle</b><br><br>
Kollin West started wearing a bracelet with the breast cancer awareness message "I (Heart) Boobies" after witnessing women seeking treatment for the disease while his father underwent chemotherapy. Some teachers thought the message was inappropriate, and they expected students to turn their bracelets over in order to hide the words. When West wore his bracelet with the words showing, he was sent to the office of Laramie Junior High's principal, Kelly Carroll. "We could take the expression that's on this wrist band, and used inappropriately, I (sic) could make a very uncomfortable environment for girls, for women, for whomever," Carroll explained. Kollin's mother Tina West thought Carroll was wrong. "(Kollin's) supporting a good cause," she argued. "(With) everything we've been through since November (when West's father was diagnosed with cancer), I think wearing the bracelet is a way he can express himself, to support it, but not have to be very vocal."

<b>Judge: Religious Flyer Distribution Allowed</b><br><br>
Judge A. Richard Caputo of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania decided that an 11-year-old student must be allowed to hand out religious flyers at her school. The flyers that prompted the case invited students to a Christmas party at a church. School officials initially prohibited the student from distributing the flyers, but her father filed a lawsuit which alleged that the school's actions violated his daughter's First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Caputo came to his decision by applying a precedent from <em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em>. According to that precedent, schools can only restrict student speech that causes a substantial disruption or invasion of the rights of others. "Here, defendant's generalized safety concern over solicitation does not serve as an adequate justification to ban all materials which may contain personal student expression," ruled Caputo. John. E. Freund III, the district's attorney, argued that the judge had "misapprehended the law."

"I'm going to bring to (the student government) a concern of a student they represent, and let them debate and discuss and come up with a proposal, or not," Cahall said. Jack Price wrote in his school's newspaper, "If you support the team and want them to keep the name, you are racist. But that doesn't mean that the Wilson administration should be allowed to ban students from wearing team gear, or anything for that matter."<br><br>

<b>Debate: "Inspirational Message" at Graduation</b><br><br>
The Florida legislature passed a law which permits school boards to "adopt a policy allowing an inspirational message to be delivered by students at a student assembly." Because of the new law, some residents wanted St. Johns County School District to plan on having a prayer at graduation. "You can allow it and you can vote on it," Kim Kendall wanted to tell the school board. There was a prayer at Nikita Storey-Burch's high school graduation in 1992, but she lamented the fact that her son's 2012 graduation had gone "the atheist way." However, board chair Tommy Allen worried about exposing the district to a lawsuit and giving students a platform upon which they could say something controversial. Board attorney Frank Upchurch agreed that adopting an "inspirational message" policy could raise constitutional concerns and put the district in a position where it was powerless to control what students said. The Freedom from Religion Foundation said it would sue the district if an "inspirational message" policy was adopted. The Liberty Counsel countered by saying it would a provide a pro bono legal defense to the district if such a lawsuit were filed.<br><br>

Participants take a daylong vow of silence to raise awareness about bullying and harassment of LGBT students. Hatcher had sent a letter to Principal Shannon Fusco asking for permission to participate. "Peaceful protests are against district policy," was Fusco's response. Hatcher appealed the decision to the school board, which denied her appeal, and Fusco warned Hatcher that if she chose to participate in the DOS anyway, "there would be disciplinary consequences." Hatcher took part in the protest and was sequestered in the school's intervention room as a consequence.

Rebecca  Markert, an attorney for the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said, "It is wildly inappropriate for the religious beliefs of a few school board members to be pushed on a captive audience of public school students." Kohls later explained that she thinks school choice programs would be the best thing for parents who want their children to receive a religious education.

On the grounds that the subject is too controversial, the North Dakota High School Activities Association said it would not make intelligent design a debate topic. "We were going to exclude kids from the state and public forum debate if we stayed with intelligent design," explained association spokesman Bob Hetler. "Some schools were afraid parents wouldn't allow their kids to do this one." Hetler said about 5 of North Dakota's 15 schools that offer debate programs took issue with the topic. Mandan School District superintendent Kent Hjelmstad said, "The message is that you want the experience of an academic challenge, but you don't need to have objectionable discussions to get that challenge." Others were struck by debaters dodging such a heavily argued subject.

Governor Deval Patrick said that a controversial teen-targeted sex education website would stay. Opponents of the site had called for its funding to be pulled because of the site's allegedly misleading discussion of abortion and sexually explicit terminology. One legislator said, "I am very disappointed. I think maybe he didn't take the time to look at the website himself. If it was his young child that could have access to it, he'd be a little bit more concerned." The governor's spokeswoman, however, said, "The Department of Public Health has been clear that the information available on this website is medically accurate."

<b>Sex Ed as an Elective</b><br><br>
A proposed bill would have bundled all sex education in public schools into an elective course and eliminated the requirement that parents be notified prior to scheduled discussions of sexuality. Many parents noted that the existing law rarely worked because schools failed to provide notification and thought the proposed legislation would give them more control over what their children learned in school. Some also supported the bill because they thought it would curb the agenda of gay advocacy groups that they felt were trying to control sex education. Groups like Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts, in contrast, argued that making sex education an elective would lead to students learning too little. "If we don't teach kids how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, we will see higher numbers (of both)" said spokesman Angus McQuilken.<br><br>

<b>Teacher Fired over Facebook Photo</b><br><br>
Pocatello High School girls' basketball coach Laraine Cook was fired after a photo of her boyfriend touching her breast was posted on her Facebook page. Cook's boyfriend, Tom Harrison, is the high school's football coach. Harrison was reprimanded, but allowed  to keep his job. Parents of girls on the basketball team met with Superintendent Mary Vagner to express their dismay over Cook's dismissal. "They wanted (Vagner) to consider reinstating the coach, with some specific guidelines in place," explained district spokeswoman Shelley Allen. However, the district stood by its decision, and eventually sought to have Cook's Idaho teaching certificate revoked. Cook noted that the district has no social media policy, and said, "I can't say that I think it's fair, because of that picture that I never thought was immoral, for me to lose my job and possibly my entire career that I worked for."<br><br>

As educators, sometimes we can talk a lot about a particular topic, but for the students to actually experience it, that's the greatest teacher." However, some students became emotional during this exercise, and parents grew concerned. There were reports of students throwing things and calling each other names during this exercise.

The bill (and its counterpart in the House) was a response to American Indian activists' request that the state's Human Rights Commission ban Indian mascots which the activists have deemed offensive. Sen. Bunch believes that that power should reside with the legislature. The bill passed both houses and was signed into law by Gov. Phil Bredesen.<br><br>

<b>Racial Slur in "Teachable Moment"</b><br><br>
A 6th grade student at Creswell Arts Magnet Middle School described something as "gay." Her teacher, Stephen Henry, overheard this and attempted to take advantage of what he described as a "teachable moment."  He told his student, "Regardless of what one means, when emotionally charged words are used, the intent of the speaker is often never heard or understood by those who actually hear the offending words." To illustrate, he asked the student how she would feel if he called her a "n-----." The mother of the girl, Anzora Lee-Starks, said her "daughter was very hurt...I think he made a very poor choice in trying to explain something that is over their heads and using the n-word in the way he did."

<b>"Busing," "Neighborhood Schools" Advocates Clash</b><br><br>
Before 2005, Racine Unified School District policy stipulated that no school could have a minority student population 10 percentage points below or 15 percentage points above the percentage of minority students enrolled district wide at that school's level. This policy was implemented through the busing of white students to predominantly black and/or Hispanic schools and vice-versa. Some Racine residents advocated for the reinstatement of the busing program in order to promote diversity in schools. "There is a lot to gain by kids from different backgrounds being in the same school," said Jennifer Cook, a sophomore at Racine Horlick High School. The NAACP presented the school board with a petition signed by over 1,000 people who supported the busing policy, and the organization "urge(d)" the board "to make the student bodies as diverse as possible." Opponents of busing argued in favor of "neighborhood schooling," a system in which students attend schools near where they live. Proponents like County Supervisor Ken Lumpkin argued that neighborhood schools promote community cohesion and interest in children's education. Moreover, he felt that the idea that a black child's education is enhanced if he is in a predominantly white school is harmful to the black child's self-esteem. School Board member Brian Dey pointed out that earlier surveys had shown that families in the district favored neighborhood schools.<br><br>

<b>Districts Choosing Mascots is Free Speech?</b><br><br>
Gov. Scott Walker (R) said that he would likely sign a bill making it very difficult for the state to order school districts to change racially or ethnically charged team names and mascots. Saying he understood concerns about the offensiveness of some mascots, Walker added, "the counterbalance to that that I'm looking at is...from a free speech standpoint...where do you draw the line on free speech?" Attorney Brian Pierson, who had defended current law, said that districts are controlled by the state, and a district "doesn't have a First Amendment right to adopt an Indian mascot."

<b>Library Declines Controversial Book Donation</b><br><br>
Forty-some students attempted to donate more than 100 books critical of homosexuality to West Springfield High School, but the donation was turned down. District library official Susan Thorniley said the books were rejected because they had not received two positive reviews from professionally recognized journals. Other librarians said the books had too much scripture, too little research, and might make homosexual students "feel inferior." Student Elizabeth Bognanno said, "Censoring books is not a good thing...We believe our personal rights have been violated."<br><br>

<b>Conroy Books Controversial</b><br><br>
Several parents of Nitro High School students found Pat Conroy's books (<em>The Prince of Tides</em> and <em>Beach Music</em>) to be inappropriate for classroom use. "I could not read (<em>all of Prince of Tides</em>). I found it very offensive," said parent Leona Tyree. She pulled her son from the class for which the book had been assigned. Karen Frazier objected to <em>Beach Music</em>, saying, "If you want to stop violence...start in the schools." Teacher Steve Shamblin defended his use of Conroy's books and pointed out, "As long was we stay in a 1950s utopian mind-set, we're not going to get past the 20th century." Terri Baur of the state ACLU chapter also weighed in: "Parents may have a fundamental right to send their child to a public school, but they don't have a fundamental right to direct the way public schools teach their child." In response to complaints, a review committee was formed. The committee approved the books with the condition that alternative selections be offered as well.<br><br>

<b>No <em>Electric Kool Aid</em>, <em>Prep</em></b><br><br>
Parents complained about the inclusion of <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em> and <em>Prep</em> on school reading lists. The complaints led to the former being removed from the lists altogether and the latter being moved to a reading list for older students. The books contain depictions of sex and drug use that some parents considered to be inappropriate. "This isn't censorship, this is common sense...A government should not be recommending explicit sexual content to minors," school board president Charles Ballard said of the challenges brought against the books. "I think you guys should teach something better than this crap," said grandparent Giuseppe Martelucci, referring to the controversial books. Another parent, Eric Adams, questioned the judgment of those who approved the books in the first place. However, some parents were skeptical of the "censorship." "You don't have to ban the book, just warn the parents," said Megan Slifka. Isaiah Zukowski commented, "In the grand scheme of things, I think books are the least of parents' problems."

<b>Worshiping at Public School Buildings</b><br><br>
For nearly two decades, efforts by the New York City schools to cease renting space to churches on weekends worked their way through the courts. In December 2011, that process seemed to come to a conclusion when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a ruling that upheld a ban on renting school space (for the purpose of worship) to churches. Renting the space appears to tear down the wall of separation between church and state, argued the ban's supporters. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the rentals had "an unintended bias in favor of Christian religions," since Christian churches worship on Sundays, when the buildings are most readily available.

Oxford University Press's "An Age of Voyages: 1350-1600" included a picture of a 19th century painting of Sikh founder Guru Nanak with closely cropped facial hair and wearing a golden crown. Sikh leaders found the picture inaccurate and offensive. They believed it made Nanak look Muslim. "Advocacy groups deciding what images should go into the book, I think is dangerous ground," said Tom Adams, director of curriculum with the state Department of Education. Sikh leaders asked publisher Casper Grathwohl to replace the image with a contemporary picture of Nanak with long facial hair and wearing a turban.  Grathwohl refused, arguing that the proposed picture was historically inaccurate. The State Board of Education asked Grathwohl to remove the image from the textbook, and to cover images included in textbooks already printed with stickers that either explained the controversy or contained an alternate picture of Nanak. Sikh leaders were not pleased with the deletion, which they argued downplayed the significance of Sikhism.<br><br>

<b>Disputing Hindu History</b><br><br>
Hindus across California expressed great discontent with history books approved by the state that they said misrepresent Hinduism--and as a result, Indian history--by focusing on the caste system and the oppression of women. Those are common smears, they said, dating back to British rule over India. California Hindus called for new, more evenhanded books adopted by a special commission charged with approving California textbooks. Many historians disagreed with their complaints, however, arguing that right-wing Hindus were trying to whitewash history. Historian Meenakshi Jain summarized the problem, saying, "there is no such thing as an objective history."<br><br>

<b>State Funded Bible Classes</b><br><br>
A new law required that the Georgia Department of Education give districts the option of offering taxpayer-funded Bible history classes. The law was the first in the country to mandate that the board of education create classes revolving around the Bible, but the board let districts choose if and how they implemented the classes. Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association, said, "What we have is an attempt to meet the mandate of the law, but to just be so, so careful to not step out and make it look as though they're designing a religious course." Some people argued that the potential for injecting religion into the schools was huge. "They didn't put in any outlines describing what they can and can't do constitutionally. The same traps are there for teachers who decide to teach the class," said the ACLU of Georgia's Maggie Garrett. However, countered one teacher, "I don't think you can understand Shakespeare, that you can understand a great deal of literary allusions or that you can understand a great deal of Western civilization without understanding the role of the Bible."<br><br>

<b>Church Group Feeding Football Team</b><br><br>
Ridgeland High School football coach Mark Mariakis arranged for a different church to provide a free meal to his team each week. The meal was often accompanied by blessings from church pastors. The Freedom From Religion Foundation, acting on behalf of a local individual, asked the Walker County superintendent to launch an investigation into Mariakis's actions. The FFRF also alleged that the coach prayed with the team, used motivational Bible verses in speeches and on team shirts, and had the team participate in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. The district determined that the coach was only giving motivational speeches to bolster student character, but did not dispute that churches were providing meals. A Facebook group supporting the coach surpassed 10,000 members.<br><br>

<b>Whose Holidays?</b><br><br>
Oak Lawn school district officials convened in October of 2007 to discuss whether they should cancel or rename school holiday traditions, most notably Christmas and Halloween. The administration acted after a Muslim parent questioned why the district, with a 30% Arab-American population, did not recognize Muslim holidays. The school originally decided to celebrate fall festival rather than Halloween and Christmas, which upset many parents. Said parent Brenda Elvidge, "It's not fair to our kids. This is America and that's an American tradition." The district decided to keep Halloween and Christmas, but added Ramadan. When a Muslim mother asked for her children to be separated from others during Ramadan, some parents fired back. "If Muslims want the school holidays, menus and school traditions to become tailored to their needs or beliefs, then they should go to private school next to their mosque," said Brian Shapiro, a local resident.<br><br>

The controversy took a turn when the Obama Department of Justice decided to represent Khan.

"It sounds like a very dubious judgment and a legal reach," said Michael Mukasey, attorney general under George W. Bush.  DOJ assistant attorney general Thomas Perez, however, said that the case was about "the religious liberty that our forefathers came to this country for."

<b>A Moment of Silence</b><br><br>
In 2007 the Illinois legislature passed a law mandating a moment of silence in public schools every morning. The law thrust the state into the national spotlight, which mainly focused on whether it broke the First Amendment separation of church and state. After state legislators overrode Governor Rod Blagojevich's veto of the law, there was protest about its implications for religion in public schools. Abby Ottenhoff, a spokesman for Blagojevich, said that "We don't believe requiring time for reflection is the role of government."

Mitchell said that the assignment was intended to instill empathy for Frank. "If you're not wearing it, you're not getting the full awareness of Anne and her family," he said. Thirteen-year-old Samantha Gage, a student in the class, objected so vehemently to the assignment that she wrote a letter about it to the <em>Concord Monitor</em>. "Many people won't learn anything except that their religion (if they're not Jewish) isn't good enough," she wrote.

"I think students are really aware they can express their opinions, and I think teachers are really aware they should allow students to express their opinions. I'm not sure that a piece of legislation is going to help students or teachers understand that better," she said.<br><br>

<b>Ten Commandments: Historical or Religious?</b><br><br>
The Giles County School Board voted to remove a display of the Ten Commandments from Narrows High School. The decision followed a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of a student who felt "genuinely disturbed by the Ten Commandments in the school." The student and the student's parent argued that the display amounted to an endorsement of a religion. Before relenting, the Giles County School Board had initially argued that the Ten Commandments were hung as part of a historical (rather than religious) display. The Liberty Counsel, which represented the school board, argued that the plaintiffs were "attempting to require that the school board sanitize any religious reference whatsoever from district facilities.

One of those students, Tayshawn Edmunds, commented "The church owns the building, so they call the shots...But I don't see why they get to control what we're doing at our school." Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that the prohibition on sex ed lessons in buildings leased from the church has not caused any problems. "We have dozens and dozens of sites with the diocese and archdiocese, and that's predicated on being responsible and following the tenets of the church," he explained. Diocese of Brooklyn spokeswoman Stefanie Gutierrez said, "It is an arrangement that has been working well for both sides for years." However, parent Lisa Smith voiced her skepticism of that arrangement. "I can't see how a church is going to tell you about what to teach," she said.<br><br>

<b>Teacher's Religious Expression Restricted</b><br><br>
Cheektowaga superintendent Dennis Kane sent teacher Joelle Silver a letter which ordered her to remove all religious items from her classroom. Those items included inspirational messages on sticky notes, a poster emblazoned with a Bible verse, and a Ronald Reagan quote: "If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God, then we will be a Nation gone under." A student had complained about the displays to the Freedom From Religion Foundation. That organization's threat of a lawsuit prompted Kane's letter. However, Silver, with the help of the American Freedom Law Center, sued the district in response to what she felt was an infringement upon her religious liberty. "Ms. Silver does not cease being a Christian nor does she shed her constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate," said Silver's attorney, Robert Muise. Kane explained his decision to a local television station. "In this case, you have two interest groups that are diametrically opposed to each other and you have to make certain decisions...And if one side doesn’t sue you, the other side probably will," he said.<br><br>

<b>Teacher's Firing Upheld</b><br><br>
In 2007 teacher John Freshwater used a Tesla coil to make a mark on a student's arm. Freshwater said the mark was an "X" that would go away, but the student thought it was meant to be a cross. His family sued. In response, the school fired Freshwater, who chose to fight his firing in court. In the legal proceedings, it was revealed that Freshwater had shown creationist videos and distributed religious handouts to his classes. He also refused to remove certain religious books and a poster from his classroom. Freshwater, who received support from many students and parents, argued that he was fired for his religion. The case wound its way all the way to an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after lower courts found both that district actions such as requiring Freshwater to remove a Bible from his desk violated his First Amendment rights, but that he was also insubordinate for not removing items like a poster of George Washington praying.

<b>Anti-Harassment or Pro-Proselytizing?</b><br><br>
A policy intended to protect homosexual employees from harassment and discrimination was expected to pass easily. However, it passed only narrowly when Jefferson County School Board member Linda Duncan changed her vote. Duncan's switch came after she heard that a lesbian teacher had pulled aside a student who had spoken offensively about lesbians and shared her sexual orientation with the student. For Duncan, the incident substantiated fears expressed by others that changing the policy would give teachers the green light to discuss their sexual orientations with students--and perhaps even proselytize to them. Duncan said that teachers "can't cross the line and discuss (their) sexual preference with a student--it's just like religion, you can't take a moment and discuss it in school, it's not appropriate." Kat Crawford--the teacher in question--countered that she is a good math teacher and does not proselytize. However, she also said, "When students make slurs and derogatory comments to each other or about other groups of people, I respond."<br><br>

<b>Which Bathroom for Transgender Student?</b><br><br>
The Asa C. Adams Elementary School was accused of discrimination by a student&#39;s grandfather because it was letting a 10-year-old boy--Nicole Maines--with &quot;sexual orientation or gender identification&quot; issues use the girls&#39; restroom (the school would not let the man&#39;s grandson do the same). The grandfather opposed the use of a girls&#39; restroom by a biologically male child. In 2009, the Maine Human Rights Commission ruled against the grandfather. &quot;Little boys do not belong in the little girls room, and vice versa,&quot; the grandfather said. &quot;This isn&#39;t just about my kid. A lot of children have come up to me and said that this isn&#39;t right.&quot; The commission also ruled that it was discriminatory to not let the transgendered student--who for a time was required to use a single-stall faculty bathroom--use the girls&#39; restroom. In 2012, a Superior Court judge found against the transgendered child in a suit against the district, stating that the district did not discriminate by requiring the student to use the faculty bathroom. In June 2013, the Supreme Judicial Court heard Maines&#39; case. &quot;(Maines&#39;) testimony was that she experienced the school picking her out of the crowd and putting her in a completely separate space, making her feel like an abnormal kid,” explained Jennifer Levi,  with Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders in Boston. In February 2014 the court ruled for Maines, saying all public schools in the state must allow children to select a bathroom based on their own gender identity. In December 2014, the Penobscot County Superior Court ordered the district to pay Maines&#39; lawyers $75,000.<br><br>

<b>Discussing Sex-Change Operations</b><br><br>
Emer O'Shea reported that her 8-year-old daughter asked her, "Is it possible for a man to have an operation to become a woman?" O'Shea's daughter heard about the subject in the classroom after another student thought a picture of a woman was "a man who had a sex-change operation." The student who asked the question has a father who underwent such an operation. The social worker who answered the question was Laura Perkins, a former board member of the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network. Principal Cynthia Marchand backed Perkins, and Superintendent Jeff Young portrayed the discussion as a "teachable moment" in response to a child's "random questioning." State law mandates that "parents must be informed whenever anything of a sexual nature occurs in the classroom," but Young concluded the topic was not planned and therefore responding was appropriate. O'Shea eventually transferred her daughter to a private school.<br><br>

"The subject matter communicated in the play is a topic that Austin believes should be examined by parents/guardians who will discuss with their elementary school age children at a time deemed appropriate by the parents/guardians," said Greg Goodman, fine arts director for Austin schools. Jonathan Saenz of the conservative Texas Values group was supportive of the district's decision. "We define marriage very clearly in the state of Texas. So if you have a play that tries to push and promote a different marriage definition, which is clearly illegal, it leads students to ask questions about it, and it leads to the discussion of sex," he said. Freeman argued that, according to state standards, her play should have been allowed. "The play is about different families...I can't see the argument that it's not age appropriate for kids in second and third grade." Parent Carmel Drewes hoped her son would get to see the play. "The more that kids are encountering various symbolism and representations of family structure, the more normal it becomes," she said.<br><br>

<b>Gender Identity and School Bathrooms</b><br><br>
Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill allowing students to choose which facilities they use and which sports they play based on each student's personal sense of gender identity (rather than biological gender). "Now, every transgender student in California will be able to get up in the morning knowing that when they go to school as their authentic self, they will have the same fair chance at success as their classmates," said Masen Davis, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. "This is a very radical idea. You're going to have first-grade boys going to the restroom next to first-grade girls without any supervision," said Karen England, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute. "Just because a boy wakes up one day and says he believes he's a girl--they shouldn't be allowed access to the girls' locker room," she added.

Coy's parents removed Coy from the school and filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, which found that the school district had violated a state law protecting transgender people from discrimination.

Allende's book includes depictions of rape and execution, but is also a best seller recognized by the International Baccalaureate organization as a world literature study book. The ACLU joined a community rally in support of keeping the book in the curriculum. "We’re proud to join students and parents from Watauga County in urging their local officials to do the right thing and not go down the slippery slope of banning books that promote critical thinking and classroom dialogue," said Chris Brook, legal director of the ACLU-NC Legal Foundation. The Watauga County School Board voted to keep the book in the curriculum.<br><br>

<b>Hoops Haircut Requirement Unconstitutional</b><br><br>
Greensburg High School boys' basketball coach Stacy Meyer required his players to have their hair cut above the ears, eyebrows, and collar, as a means to promote team unity and project a wholesome image. The U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of parents Patrick and Melissa Hayden, who said that the haircut policy violated state and federal laws, and whose son said with short hair "just didn't feel like himself." The court noted that there were no similar grooming standards in place for girls. "Coach Meyer’s policy...compels all male basketball players to wear genuinely short hair. In 2014, it is not obvious that any and all hair worn over the ears, collar, or eyebrows would be out of the mainstream among males in the Greensburg community at large, among the student body, or among school athletes," read the ruling.<br><br>

The elective course is designed to teach the narrative, history, and impact of the Bible on Western Civilization. However, some observers are skeptical that it will be delivered "objectively as part of a secular program of education" consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Abington School District v. Schempp. "When he gets the school board to act as a sovereign entity from the government, it’s not free speech, its theocracy and that’s unconstitutional,” said University Of Oklahoma law professor Rick Tepker.<br><br>

<b>Bible Confiscated</b><br><br>
A teacher at Hamilton Elementary School confiscated the Bible a second grader was reading during "read to myself time." The parents of the girl, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted the Liberty Institute about the incident. Michael Berry, senior counsel with the Institute, pointed out that the school's library has copies of the Bible. "If it's appropriate for their own library, why on Earth would it not be appropriate for their own students?" Berry asked. At least one parent supported the teacher's decision. "There should be a definite separation," the parent said. Cy-Fair issued a statement saying that the incident would be investigated and that students are required to read "just right" books, meaning books appropriate for children's abilities and consistent with the genre being taught.<br><br>

<b>English-Only a "Hostile Environment"?</b><br><br>
A 2014 U.S. Department of Education investigation determined that the Adams County School District, which has moved to an English immersion language-teaching model, created a "hostile environment" for Latino students, families, and staff. "The evidence demonstrated that the district knew of ongoing complaints of discrimination against Hispanics and failed to properly investigate or to take corrective action from the 2008-09 through the 2011-12 school years," reported J. Aaron Romine, a DOE official. In one instance, a student was injured on the playground, but a teacher was dismissive of the student's complaints because he spoke in Spanish. The district's new superintendent, Pat Sanchez, said that changes had been made since the period the investigation covered. "Very honestly, it starts with training all the adults to view our kids for all the beautiful gifts that they bring...Sixty percent of our kids come to us with the ability to speak Spanish.

<b>Sexually Explicit Book Leads to Arrest</b><br><br>
Many Gilford High School parents were upset that their children were assigned Jodi Picoult's <i>Nineteen Minute</i>, a book containing an explicit description of sex between teenagers.

Another parent, William Baer, was arrested at a school board meeting for speaking out of turn about the book. Baer did not feel that his concerns were being taken seriously. "It was basically you make a statement, you say what you want, and you sit down and shut up. That's not how you interact with adults," he said.

<b><i>Paper Towers</i> Cut</b><br><br>
John Green's <i>Paper Towers</i> was cut from Dr. John Long Middle School's eighth grade summer reading list. The removal was prompted by a parent's complaint about strong language and sexual content in the book, while Superintendent Ken Browning insisted that the book had not been banned. "The title was simply eliminated from a teacher's summer reading list of possible books for students to read over the summer," he explained. National Coalition Against Censorship executive director Joan Bertin was skeptical. "A book does not have to be censored everywhere to be censored somewhere...Any action by school officials to restrict access to a book because some object to its ideas or content offends fundamental First Amendment principles," Bertin wrote.

<b>Anti-Evolution Cartoon</b><br><br>
Some parents were upset that an anti-evolution drawing -- part of a PowerPoint presentation on an Atlanta Public Schools filesharing service for teachers -- was shown to a Grady High School biology class. The cartoon associated evolution with racism and pornography, and appeared to show evolution attacking the foundations of Christianity. "I'm pretty horrified by the idea that my children heading off to Grady might experience this. I think it needs to be addressed by the larger community," wrote a concerned parent. APS seemed to agree. "When the district learned of the PowerPoint presentation and worksheet that is in question, the lesson and supporting documents were reviewed, and they were immediately removed," said APS spokeswoman Jill Strickland Luse.

Coyne, a vegan and animal rights activist, said that she suffered a hostile work environment, that her free speech rights were violated, and that she was transferred to another school against her wishes. She filed a lawsuit against the school district. "Basically this is a woman who has a passion for animals...It’s been very stressful for her," said Coyne's attorney, Cheryl Konell Ruggiero. The district would not comment on the dispute. However, in an e-mail to school staff, Newport Harbor principal Michael Vossen said that the dissections were "a necessary skill in preparing our future surgeons."<br><br>

<b>Books Removed, Returned</b><br><br>
The Highland Park School District removed several books from the district's list of approved reading materials, including <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i>, <i>Song of Solomon</i>, <i>Siddhartha</i>, <i>An Abundance of Katherines</i>, <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>, <i>The Glass Castle</i>, and <i>The Working Poor: Invisible in America</i>. The move was prompted by complaints from parents who felt the books' sexual content and references to abuse made them inappropriate. However, some parents felt that the controversial content actually made the books more valuable. "We're doing a disservice to our students if we don’t broaden their minds and let them know more about the outside world," said Laurie Steinberg. Highland Park superintendent Dr. Dawson Orr eventually reversed the ban. "I made the decision (to ban the books) in an attempt to de-escalate the conflict, and I readily admit that it had the opposite effect," Orr said. The debate over how readings are assigned and challenged, however, continued, and one parent suggested the district assign such books as Ayn Rand's <i>We The Living</i> to replace <i>The Working Poor</i>.<br><br>

<b>"Redskins" Ban Quashed</b><br><br>
Student editors of the Neshaminy High School newspaper The <i>Playwickian</i> banned the use of the term "Redskins" in the paper, and the school's principal reversed the ban. The school's nickname is the Redskins and all students are required to publish at least one article in the newspaper. Principal Robert McGee believed that students shouldn't be banned from using the word. Frank LoMonte of Student Press Law Center defended the editors. "It's exactly what we tell young people in the abstract we want them to do: use their voices in positive ways to bring about social change," he said. Principal McGee summarized the problem: "I see it as a First Amendment issue running into another First Amendment issue." In June 2014, the newspaper received a letter to the editor repeatedly using "Redskins" and the editors blacked out each use. In response the school board increased the district's editorial oversight and suspended the papers' student editor and faculty advisor.

<b>Worry over Common Core, Islam</b><br><br>
A special event at the Fountain of Life Bible Church accused the State of Tennessee, through what speakers believed to be a Common Core-aligned curriculum, of promoting Islam. Said Craig Honeycutt, one of the speakers, "If you want to teach a few days of Islam in a historic aspect, I'm fine with that. What you're going to find...is anything but historic. It's indoctrination, it's religion, it's theology, it's philosophy, (and) it's how to convert." The curriculum, however, also contained a large amount of material on Christianity.<br><br>

<b>Choosing Teams Based on Gender Identity</b><br><br>
The Minnesota State High School League drafted a policy that would allow students to participate on sports teams based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex. Said Rob Dunkelberg of the group Transforming Families, "When my son was transitioning I had fears...What you are looking at passing here will give him the support he needs."  The Minnesota Child Protection League criticized the policy, claiming that in addition to transgender students playing “on the team opposite their biological gender,” the policy would necessitate that students of different biological sexes “shower with each other, dress with each other and share hotel accommodations.”<br><br>

<b>Contentious Social Studies Texts</b><br><br>
As the Texas State Board of Education worked to approve social studies textbooks, numerous contentious issues came to the fore, including the treatment of Islam, Moses, and the Founding Fathers. A four hour report by the Truth in Texas Textbooks Coalition, for instance, identified instances of what it labeled  “pro-Islam and anti-Christian” biases and errors in several books.  On the flip side, some proposed books "exaggerate and even invent claims” about the influence of Moses on the country’s origin, said Jennifer Graber, a religious studies professor at the University of Texas at Austin.<br><br>

<b>Teacher Removed from Committees for Core Opposition</b><br><br>
In February 2014, teacher Brad McQueen penned an op-ed taking the State of Arizona to task for adopting the Common Core national curriculum standards. Soon after, he was removed from several committees on which he had served, advising the state Department of Education on issues such as standardized testing, and he received a call in response to the article from Sarah Gardner, the state's testing director.  In December 2014, the Goldwater Institute filed a suit on behalf of McQueen, saying that the state had violated his speech rights by punishing him for his op-ed. <br><br>

<b><i>Nutcracker</i> Christmas Tree Too Religious?</b><br><br>
The PTA at Butler Elementary School in Belmont quietly cancelled an annual trip to the see <i>The Nutcracker</i> because some parents claimed the presence of a Christmas tree on stage was overly religious. "In the past years there were parents' complaints as the <i>Nutcracker</i> has religious content," said PTA co-president Barbara Bulfoni. After a broad outcry the PTA reversed the decision, but parent Laurie Manjikian said she feared the same thing would happen again next year.<br><br>

<b>Bus Driver Says Homosexuality is a Sin</b><br><br>
A bus driver for the East Baton Rouge school district reportedly told a student that he would go to hell because he was homosexual. She also reportedly told him to go to church to overcome his "sinful ways." The ACLU of Louisiana subsequently wrote to district officials on the student's behalf,  and  the district replied that the driver had received some discipline but that training on discussing subjects such as religion and homosexuality was not something drivers received. The ACLU objected that the driver continued to drive the bus the aggrieved student takes to school.<br><br>

<b>Separating Girls and Boys</b><br><br>
Charles Drew Elementary School segregates about a quarter of its classes by sex, based on the belief that differences between boys and girls affect how they learn. Teachers “recognize the importance of understanding that Angeline learns differently from Angelo,” said Angeline H. Flowers, principal of Charles Drew.  The school is one of several in Broward County that offer some single-sex classes.  Critics claim there is little evidence the practice helps, and dividing children by gender can reinforce stereotypes.  “You say there’s a problem with sexism and instead of addressing the sexism, you just remove one sex,” said Rebecca Bigler, a psychologist at the University of Texas.<br><br>

<b>Supe Apologizes for Tweet</b><br><br>
The superintendent for St. Paul Public Schools apologized  for a Twitter comment she made after a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer for shooting an African-American man in Missouri. "No indictment for officer Wilson," read the tweet. "Very sad day in America. How do I explain this to my black students?" The remark offended people on many sides of the controversy. "After 200 hours of examining the facts, the grand jury ruled no bill. We cannot understand how a leader of education could possibly post something so irresponsible and disturbing without complete knowledge of the facts," wrote David Titus, president of the St. Paul Police Federation. Student Charlotte Richardson-Deppe said she disagreed with the grand jury decision, but also objected to the tweet, saying, "It is something that  everybody needs to be aware of, and it sort of felt like she was singling out the black students for that." Superintendent Valeria Silva eventually responded to the firestorm, apologizing for the tweet and saying  her intent was to express "sadness" about the situation. She also noted that "the amount of time that people spent questioning my tweet and the time I spent responding underscores that race still matters in this country." <br><br>

<b>Protest Poster Removed</b><br><br>
Students at Lewiston High School wanted to protest two grand jury decisions to not bring charges against police officers accused of wrongfully killing black men. At first they wanted to join a national student walkout, but, said senior class president Muna Mohamed, they were told that if they walked out they could face “unintended consequences,” including possible suspensions. “We were told that other students might feel uncomfortable and it could lead to other demonstrations,” Mohamed said. Instead, students created a poster that said "#blacklivesmatter," but it was removed by school officials. Student Chandler Clothier said the school's principal told him the poster would have to say "all lives matter" to remain. "They keep saying they want students to raise their voices, but they want to define the students' voices," Clothier said. Superintendent Bill Webster said that the issue wasn't the content, but failure to get approval for the poster.<br><br>
