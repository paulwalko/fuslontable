<b>Details:</b> A 2006 memo from then city Administrator Robert Bobb outlines the District of Columbia’s intention to publish its data, previously only accessible to city staff through an intranet site, to the public website. The effort was closely aligned with the <a href="http://www.govtech.com/magazines/gt/Quantifiable-Improvements.html" target="_blank">DCStat program</a>, intended to provide real-time metrics to help better manage city operations. Data sets included in the initial effort were service requests, property information, permits and licensing, and crime incidents. Today, the District’s Data Catalog includes 495 data sets, accessible in multiple formats.<br>

The document was issued by Office of Management and Budget Director Peter R. Orszag, responding to direction from President Obama earlier that year. Formally establishing a “presumption of openness,” the document set deadlines for executive departments and agencies to advance their own open government plans, and publish data sets online. A May 2013 executive order defines White House open data policy more explicitly, setting the new default for government data as open and machine-readable. Broadly cited as an impetus for many open data policies that followed, the federal policy brought forth an improved <a href="https://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> site built on open source, and today hosts more than 85,000 sets of data.<br>

<b>Color coding:</b> 1<br>
<b>Details:</b> Through a resolution on Jan. 29, 2013, San Mateo County’s manager and CIO were directed to develop an open data policy, with the resolution declaring that each department would provide appropriate data sets for inclusion on the <a href="https://data.smcgov.org/" target="_blank">portal</a>. Signed on March 7, 2013, the policy outlined the county’s transition toward an open government. In addition to providing data sets, the county departments’ responsibilities include conducting quarterly reviews of the quality of their data, progress in providing access to data sets requested by the public and inclusion of new sets. An Open Data Committee was also created to establish rules and standards for implementing the policy and keeping the portal up to date.<br>

<b>Details:</b> Utah’s open data legislation, passed in March 2013, calls on the Transparency Advisory Board to develop plans, make recommendations and determine what information state and local agencies will provide. Comprised of a well rounded group of people — including legislators, technologists, local government representatives and two members of the public — the board was tasked with making recommendations for the state’s <a href="http://www.utah.gov/open" target="_blank">open data portal</a> and released its <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/188701154/Utah-Transparency-Advisory-Board-Report-Final-As-submitted" target="_blank">first report</a> in November 2013. Recommendations from that document said the open data portal should prominently feature: financial transparency, open access to public data repositories, and a single point of access for government records requests.<br>

<b>Details:</b> In 2013, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the state Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) to create an open data website that would be a “one-stop” source for publishable data from all state government entities. Cuomo’s executive order also established a state chief data officer within ITS and directed all state entities covered by the order to appoint a data coordinator. The state open data site also is open to local governments, and Cuomo directed ITS to offer technical help and other resources to localities interested in posting data to the site. More than 1,100 data sets are now available on the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us" target="_blank">New York state open data portal</a>.<br>

<b>Details:</b> Hawaii’s open data policy was passed in 2013, a year in which the movement gained considerable momentum in state and local government. The legislation references former CIO Sonny Bhagowalia’s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/e-government/Hawaii-Embarks-on-a-Tech-Transformation.html" target="_blank">Business and Information Technology/Information Resource Management Transformation Plan</a>, a multifaceted initiative that called on the state to publish its information on a public portal to further transparency efforts, engage citizens and encourage innovation. The portal pre-dated the state’s adoption of a formal policy and now hosts a wide variety of data sets, some of which have logged nearly 15,000 views apiece.<br>

<b>Details:</b> New Hampshire’s open data policy stems from 2012 legislation that also directed state agencies to consider open source software when purchasing new technology. The bill directed the state CIO to develop a policy to make all public data available — unless subject to privacy, security or other limitations — in a machine-readable format. In addition, the bill specifies the release of primary data “with the highest possible level of granularity” and that the information should be downloadable by anyone without a registration requirement.<br>

State departments had 30 days from the signing of the order to identify an agency data officer who was tasked with proposing which data sets from his or her organization should be posted on the state’s website. The agency data officer also is responsible for ensuring that the data sets do not contain protected information. Connecticut’s chief data officer was charged with managing the open data portal and implementing the executive order.<br>

<b>Details:</b> Pittsburgh added its name to the list in March 2014 by finalizing its open data addition to the administrative code of ordinances. Open data is identified as a means of improving service to citizens, and enhancing collaboration between city departments and its external stakeholders.
