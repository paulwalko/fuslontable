<b>Location:</b> Alberta<br>
<b>Description:</b> Alberta is one of the Canadian provinces that will fare well during the coming pole shift, and be positioned for a temperate climate in the Aftertime, as will Sasketchewan. When the bow afflicting the N American continent finally relaxes, following the New Madrid adjustment, it will not affect these Canadian provinces as much as it affects those West Coast regions crossed by the San Andreas and abutting the Juan de Fuca Plate. Mountain building and volcanic eruptions will occur closer to the coast, in British Columbia, than inland. The land is high land, above the waves in the Aftertime, and established agriculture that will support survivors. This said, are these provinces attractive to the elite, and likely to be taken as enclaves of the elite prior to the pole shift?<br>

<b>Location:</b> Anhui<br>
<b>Description:</b> The provinces along the coastline of the Yellow Sea will suffer from tidal bore that will roar up into the bay until it drowns Beijing. Cities such as Shanghai will find the combined high tide and tidal bore more than they can stand. Even those clinging to boats will suffer in the swirling waters. Those above Beijing will find themselves hosting sputtering politicians, who will attempt to made demands and expecting subservience. Their climate will remain similar to today, however, so survivors will have less adaptation required.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Baja<br>
<b>Description:</b> During the shortening of the Pacific, water first washes in from the Pacific, over the peninsula, and then inland along the coast, having been buffered to some degree by the slowing of flow over the Baja land. The water then wants to slosh back, seeking its level, and starts a return toward the Baja peninsula. On the return trip, which is a bit slower than the ocean at large as the tidal trust was diminished by the original trip over the Baja landmass, it will meet with water once again sloshing inland from the Pacific, as this slosh has a higher frequency.<br>

<b>Location:</b> British Columbia<br>
<b>Description:</b> British Columbia will experience some of the plate subduction problems troubling the western part of the United States, but with a difference. Canada, in this area, will be stretched, with it's upper part attached to the all the way over the North Pole, into Russia. As the western United States is pushed and crumpled, the lands it is attached to will be stretched. This tends to alleviate any crumpling that occurs due to the subducting Pacific plate, a trade-off. Nevertheless, this makes for a rugged ride, as these adjustments are never smooth, here crumpling, there stretching, so being on solid rock to lessen the impact is wise.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Connecticut<br>
<b>Description:</b> As part of the New England complex that will benefit from the St. Lawrence Seaway ripping open, Connecticut will have a higher sea level after the shift than it enjoys now. However, leading into the shift, it will be subject to waves from the sloshing Atlantic that will drown the coastline. Residents hoping to find their homes above water after the shift should leave, moving inland for the shift itself, and then returning to the coastline to pick up the pieces. Homes at an elevation of 500 or more feet will be the only ones remaining after the poles melt. However, ocean fishing, an occupation of the residents today, will continue to be a source of food for the survivors, and the climate should, if anything, be milder than today.<br>

The climate will be more moderate than today, especially after the ice of Greenland melts and the near proximity from that great meltoff no longer creates cold tides on the shore of Quebec. The greatest concern that Quebec will have after the shift will be migrating survivor from the population centers of eastern half of the US.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Rio de Janeiro<br>
<b>Description:</b> Rio de Janeiro will suffer great trauma during the hour of the pole shift.

<b>Description:</b> The wave that will rear up from the new land rising between the tip of S America and Africa will create a huge amount of water seeking to find its level. This is not the pole shift tide of 500-600 feet, caused by sloshing. This is a displacement of water caused by the edge of the Antarctic Plate rising up at this point, to create new land. This will affect coastal areas all the way to Rio de Janeiro. Rio Grande do Sul has highlands aplenty, but at least 1,000 feet should be sought during the hour of the pole shift. Stay out of ravines, where tidal bore will occur, and do not leave your high perch for at least a day as the water that poured inland will be looking for an outlet back to the sea.<br>

But during the hour of the shift, those who would survive are advised to go to the highest points in the mountain ranges in the area. Our general advice to be 100 miles inland and 200 feet above sea level does not apply in areas destined to experience tidal bore. Even the high points close to the coast will find water pouring over them.

<b>Location:</b> Alps<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Alps have steadily grown during the periodic cataclysmic geological changes that pole shifts produce, due to the nearness of the fault line that runs through the Mediterranean. Where the Atlantic widens, stretching the lands in western Europe away from the Alps, and where the African Rift Valley pulls Arabia away from the African mainland, it would seem that anything but mountain building would occur in the Alps. But just as ripping cloth causes wrinkles just above the top of the rip, the separating Rift Valley in Africa causes pressure in the Mediterranean on either side of the rift. Thus, land is pushed up, north of the Mediterranean and into the Alps, to relieve the stress west of the Rift Valley, as land along the plate edge to the east of the Rift Valley is sliding along as well as subducting under, the Eurasian Plate.<br>

As with Mongolia Volcanic ash will not sweep the area, which will enjoy clean air. Mountain building will not occur, nor has it for many eons, as this mountain range is far enough from the Himalayas and is participating somewhat in the stretch that the Eurasian Plate will sustain.

Where relatively isolated now, those living in these mountains will find themselves increasingly crowded with survivors who will be forced to move inland to escape the rising waters.

<b>Description:</b> The Canadian Rockies have an advantage during the coming pole shift, in that the portion of Pacific plate that will be forced under them during the shortening of the Pacific is less, overall, than the portion of plate to be thrust under further south, along the western coast of the US, for instance. Thus, only the land within 500 miles of the coast, in the Canadian Rockies, will experience subduction with consequent hot earth and the rock and roll of mountain building.<br>

<b>Description:</b> We have already stated that the Cordoba range would be a safe zone, safe from the tidal waves rushing in from the Atlantic. Hot springs appear in many places around the world, where the crust is thin, primarily due to stretching. Argentina, at Buenos Aires, will experience stretching as the top part of S America is pulled to the west while the tip of S America is nailed firmly at the Antarctic Plate. The bay at Buenos Aires will rip open, as we have stated. Thus inland, in San Luis, there are hot springs. This will not result in volcanic eruptions during the pole shift.<br>

<b>Description:</b> The effect of tidal waves on land have been documented and even recently observed, and are less of a mystery than the effect on those in boats out to sea.

<b>Description:</b> Southern cities on the East Coast, such as Atlanta, Georgia, at an 800 foot above sea level height, will watch a flood approach. This is due in part to the timing of the stretch and rip, as the stretch will be sustained for the better part of an hour during a time when water will rush from the poles, where it has moved during the stopped rotation, and will have the push of on-coming water behind it as it flows up against the coastline. Atlanta, stationed between the Gulf and the Atlantic, will also find itself at a place where two floods, both with their own timing of ebb and flow, clash. This has the potential of heightening the water, forcing it up to an astonishing degree, where the clash occurs.<br>

Combined with crumbling buildings, which will scarcely withstand the jolting as the Red Sea and African Rift separate further during the initial moments of the shift hour, nor the crashing as the moving crust stops at the end of the hour. The danger in tides moving inland is that many structures considered on solid ground will find the ground melting under them, and falter. Thus, residents may be trapped even in buildings that withstand quakes, and drown as the water rises. Others, injured during the quakes, will be unable to stay afloat when the tides drag them back into the Mediterranean.

But after the pole shift, these lands will shift to have a climate more akin to the current sun belt of the US, with rich soil and good drainage. The roads through the mountains west of the Continental Divide, and lands some 60 miles to the east of the Continental Divide will be torn up and unusable, but the eastern portion of Montana may find its roads repairable.

During the shift itself, the greatest danger comes from local torrential rains colliding with a backwash coming up from the Mississippi. Survivors will find themselves moving into the Appalachian mountains over time, pushed there by a widening Ohio River that will cut off access in all directions within months of the shift.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Fairbanks is positioned inland far enough that tidal waves will dissipate their force before reaching the city. However, it lies low enough that melting poles will cover the city shortly. The river basin that Fairbanks sits upon will suffer during the shift from several sources. First, being at a relatively low altitude, the land may be inundated during the rotation stoppage due to water draining from the equator and pooling at the poles. This will only affect land close to the poles, such as Alaska. Second, during the shift itself, when the North American continent is pushed north and under any water in its path, this water will be pushed into the river basin from the ocean,<br>

<b>Location:</b> Moscow<br>
<b>Description:</b> The heart of Russia, Moscow, will not fare well during the coming Earth changes. A city of old structures, massive stone and old brick, it will be subject to easy destruction during any earthquake beyond the trivial that strikes during the shift, and strike they will. The broken link effect will apply block by block, as old plumbing will burst, old walls collapse, and old wires will snap. Every resident of Moscow can expect to be isolated, no ability to communicate, no assurance that one will be rescued from a collapsed wall or building, and certainly no hope the infrastructure will be repaired, ever.<br>

<b>Description:</b> New York City is one of the most heavily populated areas, and by being a coastal city, has additional strikes against it. Thought the Atlantic will recede at first during the pole shift, due to the Atlantic widening and the waters having in general flowed toward the poles when the Earth's rotation stops, wave action and reaction will find all shorelines bombarded with sloshing water at some point. For many, on islands along the coast supported by a system of bridges that have been torn apart, they will have no escape.<br>

<b>Location:</b> North Bay<br>
<b>Description:</b> North Bay, Ontario is an example of an inland lake region that will change as a result of the shift. Due to the widening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, with release of tension along the banks of the seaway, this land will pop up and rise in elevation in relation to the surrounding land. North Bay currently drains into the Great Lakes, and will continue to do so, but will find more water coming from the direction of land along the seaway than from its current drainage configuration from the mountains inland. Thus, a larger lake, with more tributaries, as a result of the Shift. Fishing in this inland lake should be good, and the climate warmer than today.<br>

Buildings constructed with only gravity and earthquakes in mind do not withstand being covered by a flood tide, something the engineers did not think of. Foundations erode, and water soaked walls crumble, so that the weak link theory applies and they crash, one by one, often into each other. All cities should be avoided during the shift, due to these types of problems. Mount St. Helens will activate, violently, during the shift, and spew for some decades afterwards, so living downwind from this volcano will find any survivors struggling against constant dust. Thus, moving to what is now north, toward Canada, or clinging to the coast line which will afford good fishing, is the best option for Aftertime living.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Seoul, South Korea, will find itself in a migration dilemma. Given the assaults from water that the peninsula of Korea will experience, a low expectation of survival, those who would survive should consider migrating before the hour of the shift. Tensions between North and South Korea are notorious, and due to get worse, not better, during the forthcoming tense years.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Singapore<br>
<b>Description:</b> Singapore is unfortunately located from several standpoints, and will suffer both during the pole shift and during the years after the pole shift. Being on low land and along a coast, with the potential of tidal waves from almost all sides due to its prominent location on the tip of a peninsula, it will surely be wracked by high tides which will wash most of the city away. Any survivors will find themselves in near-freezing temperatures, as the pole shift will place them closer to the new South Pole than the equator. The land will then be subject to inundation during polar melt, with the only escape route along an increasingly narrow peninsula.<br>

Tidal waves will likewise not reach this far inland. The greatest dangers come from high winds, which will blow inland from the Pacific as it shortens, and the danger in low lying areas of heat from the subducting plates.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Although situated on the bed of a salt lake and thus stable from a standpoint of being hard rock unlike to crack and heave during mountain building pressure, the inland valley in California has geography below the former salt lake bed floor. We have stated that river bottoms are situated along areas of a plate that are thin, and have thus sunk down, thus becoming a river bottom. Stockton considers itself at the headwaters of the delta area, but the great San Joaquin River flows past it, and Stockton is thus situated along a river bottom region. Where former salt lake beds are unlikely to crack during Earth plate stress, the rock strata beneath it can adjust, producing earthquakes.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Toronto<br>
<b>Description:</b> Toronto, Canada is situated on the edge of high drama that will occur during the Pole Shift. Those of faint heart are advised to move inland for the duration of the drama. The St. Lawrence Seaway is due to further its split during the shift, widening the Seaway to what will become an ocean bay. During the split the bordering land will not sink. The release of tension of connectedness to plates in the Atlantic will be stretched and drawn downward as the Atlantic widens, and then when the rip occurs the lands bordering the Seaway will bob up somewhat. However, the action will be heart stopping. In general, this section of Canada as all of Canada will have a good climate in the Aftertime, a temperate climate.<br>

As improbable as may seem, the hardened soil, which creates flash floods in the desert, will give this desert area water problems both during the shift and during the almost perpetually rainy years afterwards. Tucson is surrounded by mountains, which will run rainwater into the lowlands. With rising sea levels pushing back on the rivers, rivers will empty more slowly, and thus flash floods can become lakes.

<b>Description:</b> For Vancouver, the issue is not being positioned after the shift, but surviving the shift itself. The West Coast in general will suffer from rapid subduction that will melt the rock in low lying places, due to heat from friction, and many local Indian tribes have tales and myths of such times. Tidal waves will assault the area, and volcanoes up and down the coast, dormant and active alike, will explode. Those who would survive might consider moving inland for the shift itself, and then returning. Be advised that bridges and roads will not be passable, so the return trip should be anticipated to be essentially on foot.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Caribbean Islands<br>
<b>Description:</b> The islands in the Caribbean will be utterly devastated during the coming shift, hit from several sides. When the Americas move into the Pacific, shortening the distance around the Pacific Rim and widening the Atlantic, the giant continents of North and South America will not simply drift evenhandedly westward. Moving plates move in the direction of least resistance, which in this case is toward the middle of the Pacific hole. Central America loses in this crunch, as do the smaller plates supporting the Caribbean islands. Any island surviving this crush, where smaller plates will subduct under larger giants, will have to deal with tidal waves washing over them and exploding volcanoes. Going to sea in boats will scarcely be an answer, as the turmoil the water will be undergoing will create vortexes that will capsize large and small boats, and even dash well built submarines in deep water. Surviving in the Caribbean, during this violent shift, will be the exception, and will require luck, not planning.<br>

The Crimea, surrounded on most sides by water, is also vulnerable to sea level changes, including influx from the melting poles which will cause the oceans of the world to rise over 650 feet above their current levels. Due to the forcible thrust of the India/Australian plate under the Himalayas, there will be some lifting of the land affecting even the Crimeas, so some land will remain above sea level even after the poles have melted. However, this will likely be a series of islands, not continuous land, compounding the problems facing any survivors who will be less able to wander to more hospitable lands.<br>

<b>Description:</b> The Pacific Plate is assumed to be a single plate, but it is not. Hawaii, which rides higher after every major adjustment in the area, is rising, and this can only be the case if there is subduction of a plate somewhere, pushing the plate that Hawaii rides on up. The Society Island are on a chain that forms a line with the Hawaii Islands, and such a rise is not a coincidence.
