All the time i have lived in Launceston (North Cornwall) UK, have i ever seen queues for petrol until tonight, where normally the petrol stations would be deserted. But now we have people panic buying, and because we live in a small town, the next petrol station is miles away.
So if we run out, we are doomed.

I was just visiting my local Esso Garage in Bromley Road garage to buy my husbands some cans of beer.  As I approached the garage, I was met with a queue of cars to the entrance.  As I drove past, I could see the forecourt was jam packed.  I parked my car in a nearby road and walked to the garage.  When I drove past the queue, I noticed it had got even longer.  This garage is usually empty at this time of night, so it was definately a panic buying situation.<br>

I work 17 miles from home and have got home with less than 5miles of fuel! Tried Tesco Expressd Garage in Bridgnoth, Shropshire,  Low town as last resort and queue were causing chaos..couldnt take chance only to find out none left. Again no signs! Do the owners of the petrol stations think we will pop in for some over priced sweets if no fuel? Hope its resolved tomorrow and ive just been unlucky with the amount of topping up!<br>

I'm not panic buying but simply trying to fill up as normal - my petrol gauge is already 'in the red'.

There was panic buying at the local supermarket this afternoon, with long queues.  I decided to leave it to later to fill up.  Now I wish I hadn't.  Tonight, I did a tour of six local filling stations all of which had run out.  It looks as if there's no fuel left in the town.

I hope new supplies arrive soon; I need my car to get to work and I've only enough fuel left in the tank for one day's travel.<br>

Yesterday queues for petrol blocked the entrance road to the supermarket preventing people from getting in to shop (unlees you were prepared to join the queue). I rang to complain about this today and the duty manager said he had to queue for 20 minutes today to get in to work. He also said people were buying small amounts of petrol (sometimes Â£5 or under)so 'topping up their tanks' as the government has advised!! The road layout is not able to cope with this excessive queuing and the City Council may consider altering the phasing of traffic lights to cope with the problem.<br>

Passed a garage in Newbury this morning. Normally it has 1 or 2 cars at about 9.00. Today there was a queue of about 15 cars down the A4 which blocked the road at times.

Also similiar at a garage in Tadley(RG26), about 6.00pm last night. Queue out down the road when there isn't normally one.

However I was able to fill up my car at 9.00pm. All diesel pumps were closed which suggests they ran out of diesel.<br>

Yesterday I almost ran out of fuel for the first time in my driving history, thanks to panic buying in the South Wirral area.  

Having driven from some distance away it was inevitable that at some point during the day I would need to re-fuel, but this hadn't caused me any concern as I was aware that no fuel strike had actually been planned.  Unfortunately I had not banked on people having panic bought in the local area.  I had to drive to five petrol stations (each a distance away from each other) before I finally found one which had any unleaded petrol left.  Even then, I was only able to fill up after enduring a long queue that blocked up the nearby roads.  Speaking to the petrol station staff they could see no reason for this ridiculous situation other than that people who did not in fact need fuel at that point were panic buying.  I saw people walking out of the petrol station with two jerry cans each and putting them in the boots of their cars.

The Government's advice has been completely irresponsible.  It has created a crisis unnecessarily, put drivers who genuinely need to top up at risk and encouraged people to store dangerously flammable fuel at home.<br>

tempers getting frayed to the point that the police turned up in a riot van! i saw a woman of a certain age do a u-turn in front of a double decker in order to join the queue - totally oblivious and almost causing an accident. passed 5 stations on my (walking) journey and every one had the same story. what is wrong with these people? can't help wondering how many of them really need petrol and how many are panicking because they are worried they may actually have to walk somewhere!<br>

<h2>Formby, Merseyside, UK, L37</h2><br>
All three petrol stations in Formby have clearly been affected by panic buying. The forecourts of all them have been very busy, leading to shortages at the pumps. It at least one case all of the petrol had gone leaving only diesel fuel available. Twitter reports suggest that the Tesco petrol station had needed traffic wardens to marshal the ensuing queues. The three companies concerned are Tesco, BP and Texaco. Local twitter reports on @formbyvillage and #formby will continue to be monitored locally while the question of fuel supply remains in question.
During the day tomorrow there will be regular live updates on formby.n0tice.com<br>

Queues and queue rage; motorists exclaiming within earshot, at the slowness and apparent rationing of pumps and fuel. Tesco staff, although probably pleased at much business, as opposed to poor, had to skip around forecourt consumption to identify purchases at the till. It was repeatedly reported in the media (in my case BBC Radio 4) that strikes require 7 days notice. Prematurely, motorists sounded ready to blame hard working people, for a scenario that they had created.<br>
