<b></b> Smugglers find many places to hide in the neighborhood surrounding East Street just north of the border fence. There are several ravines and wooded areas nearby, and residents have found crossers hiding on their porches and in their garbage cans. Border Patrol vehicles drive quickly through this area where there are often children playing in the street.<br>

<b></b> Much of Nogales, Sonora, sits higher in elevation than the United States.
