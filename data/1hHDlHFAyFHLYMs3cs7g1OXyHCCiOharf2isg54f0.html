<b>Location:</b> St. Augustine, FL<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Summer Day at Over-Fork<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1955<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham paints from memory, leading to altered appearances from real life and the inclusion of symbols favored by him. An example in this painting are wells for drawing water. Recognizable by the arms for raising and lowering buckets, they are consistently present in other paintings, such as Spoonbill Point which is also a location in St. Augustine.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Boothbay Harbor, ME<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Gabriel Overlooking Boothbay Harbor<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1960<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham's interpretation of Boothbay Harbor imparts a sense of serenity which mimics its real life counterpart. Although the exact shapes of the shorelines do not match, and the real version is home to significantly more vessels, Cunningham manages to capture the essence of Boothbay Harbor in its expansive nature. He also includes boats with sails that can be found throughout his paintings.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Everglades, FL<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Seminole Everglades<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1945<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham represents the Everglades as a serene location, and his paintings correlate to the numerous paintings and written accounts of the lives of Seminoles and their environment. The brown water and the long shadows are consistent with accounts that were widely available at the time. In this case Cunningham combines his tendency to add his own elements to real locations.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Ashepoo River in Spring<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1930<br>
<b>Significance:</b> The Ashepoo River empties into the Saint Helena Sound between Charleston and Beaufort. As a direct nod to the fertile lands of South Carolina, Cunningham paints the lands golden, and the image of the shore is completed with pines, fruit trees, birds, and a boathouse. One of Cunningham's quirks, however, presents itself in the presence of a Native American in the regalia of a Plains or Woodlands tribe.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Folly Beach, SC<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Red Sky Over Folly's Beach, S.C.<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1975<br>
<b>Significance:</b> One of Cunningham's most dramatic paintings, the red clouds loop over the upper left and right corners, mimicking stage curtains, and the water and sky are separated only by thin yellow lines. The sense of coming dawn, coupled with the waters calm enough to reflect the schooners, reflects the serene atmosphere Cunningham experienced at the beach, if not its actual appearance.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Dismal Swamp Canal, Chesapeake, VA<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Carolina Canal<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1945<br>
<b>Significance:</b> As consistent as Cunningham's irreverence for painting true-to-life landscapes of real locations is his tendency for non-local color. Non-local color is the use of colors that would not have been realistically present in the scene the artist observed. The pink river exemplifies this tendency, and can be found in other paintings by Cunningham. Additionally, this painting shows Cunningham's melding of the water and sky, with only a couple yellow lines as separation.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Castillo de San Marcos, FL<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Summertime at Fort San Marcos<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1970<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham painted locations, often with figures and wildlife, and included recognizable elements delineating different Native American tribes. It is unusual for him to have painted a specific historical moment, as he seems to have done here. The fort itself is constructed differently in reality, but it seems Cunningham wanted to illustrate the time when Osceola was imprisoned here. A figure can be seen in nineteenth century military regalia, and the fort in the painting has a heightened jail-like appearance.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Goose Rocks Beach<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Goose Rock Beach, Maine<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1960<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham's sense of location was strong, though it's difficult to reliably determine how much time passed between his visit to these locations and painting them. This time and distance leads to changes in visual appearance. Many beach scenes were painted during a hard time in his life, and in the case of Goose Rock Beach, it's one of the many scenes and locations he painted which show harbors, inlets, and islands which offer protection.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Ogunquit, ME<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Safe Harbor - Perkins Cove<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1930<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Open to the northeast, the cove turns and opens into a basin that protects during storms. The cove and the cove in Cunningham's painting resemble one another, but the topography of Perkins Cove is different. Alterations in the scale, island positioning, and distance between land masses are attributed to compositional reasons, as well as painting from memory.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Canton, GA<br>
<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Etowah River Dock<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1928<br>
<b>Significance:</b> The Etowah River flows through eastern Georgia and empties into Allatoona Lake. Cunningham wasn't interested in painting an inland waterway, so he instead added a ship with sails and relocated the mouth of the river to the edge of the ocean. Once again, Cunningham has reordered the elements of the composition to better comprise a scene rather than paint true-to-life. Photographs of that location were found in Cunningham's possession with writing on the back: "found lots of things here."<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Approaching Squall at Boothbay<br>
<b>Year:</b> no date<br>
<b>Significance:</b> As Colonial Williamsburg's director of museums Carolyn Weekley notes in her catalog essay, "Cunningham's use of color for sunsets, nights, bright sunny days, coming storms and the like seem[s] grossly exaggerated and unnatural. Some probably are stronger, brighter and deeper in tone than they could be in nature. But these passages were real to the artist, and they were carefully constructed from his memory as personal experiences with the natural world as it seemed to him at specific times" (Earl Cunninham's America, 2007).<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1940<br>
<b>Significance:</b> This work was presented to President George W. Bush by Michael A. and Marilyn L. Mennello in a ceremony at the White House, and is currently on display at Camp David. Although the painting depicts typical Floridian scenery, and the serenity matches that of his Everglades pieces, the work is hard to place to one existing location.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Chief Osceola<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1962<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham regularly painted locations, but seldom real people or historical events. His painting "Summertime at Fort San Marcos" depicts true historical regalia, but this work specifically delineates Chief Osceola. This underlines Cunningham's interest in the Seminole people and way of life, as both works seem to be a focus on his life, as it is here, and his death, as represented in "Fort San Marcos."<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> The Everglades<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1960<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Although Cunningham stated that this painting was purchased by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House restoration, based on a letter sent to Cunningham by her social secretary, Letitia Baldrige, thanking him for the painting it is more likely he gifted the work. Possibly, the First Lady or an associate admired the work and he gifted it as a result. The acceptance of the work demonstrates the esteem of art reflecting America. In 1961, it hung prominently in the White House, where it could be glimpsed during presidential television interviews.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Everglades Settlement, Dawn<br>
<b>Year:</b> no date<br>
<b>Significance:</b> One of Cunningham's most notable skills is his use of light and color to create atmosphere in his works. Dawn, as created here, storms, and other weather conditions are all created with mastery and perhaps more vibrancy than nature truly allows.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Gathering Clouds Off Little River Inlet<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1962<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham was born in Edgecombe, Maine, not far from Boothbay Harbor, Maine, where a hub of folk-artists lived and worked. It was here that Cunningham began to take on the title of "Primitive Artist." This piece in particular is reminiscent of fellow Maine native Marsden Hartley.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Hilton Head<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1938<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham almost exclusively uses a bird's-eye point of view, and frequently painted his horizons on a curve. Once, when asked why the horizons were curved, Cunningham viewed the question as criticism and responded that they must be one of those people who believe the earth is flat.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Houseboat at Oyster Keys<br>
<b>Year:</b> no date<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham painted with his own personal transformation of scale and color palette, which contributed to his "folk Platonism." This Platonic painting style stems from an on-going debate between followers of the philosophers Aristotle and Plato regarding the truth of the concrete world versus the transcendent view which can only be experienced through art.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Springtime at Bay Point, Georgia<br>
<b>Year:</b> no date<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham seems to have been particularly interested with evenings and dawns, and seasons of the year. This is reflected in the intense color choices he was fond of, as well as the titles he assigned to the works, such as this one Springtime at Bay Point, Georgia, and others included here.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1950<br>
<b>Significance:</b> There is reason to believe that Cunningham's art served as a way for him to integrate himself with the world and reconcile his youthful adventures with the trials of old age. In recreating these locations, Cunningham allowed himself some room to play: elements slip from one geographical location to another, resulting in New England houses on the shores of South Carolina or New England scenes with pink flamingos.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Norsemen Discovering the New World<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1930<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham took liberties in his recreations of historical events, such as here where Viking ships share the water with Native American canoes. Drawing on his imagination and real life observations, he populated waterways with Native American canoes, Norse vessels and late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century sailing ships. Additionally, the Indians shown paddling wear feather headdresses that look remarkably like those worn by the Passamaquoddy residents of Pleasant Point, Maine. He grew up hearing tales about Norsemen exploring the Americas, had a special affinity for Indian culture and artifacts, and was familiar with a variety of sailing vessels.<br>

<b>Significance:</b> Born in Maine, this work demonstrates Cunningham's fond memories. He paints ships, pine trees, a striped lighthouse, coastal structures, and fishermen on the docks.

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Busy Day at Frompton Inlet<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1952<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Due to Cunningham's tendency to paint from memory, and far removed from the location, the idiosyncrasies between his paintings and real life are easily explained. This also explains why his titles sometimes contain misspellings. In this case, the name of the real life location is FrAmpton, rather than FrOmpton.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1945<br>
<b>Significance:</b> In art, symmetry is a traditional element and seeks to bring order to a chaotic world. For Cunningham, symmetry is the way he brings his personal experiences into a universal language, although it is not rigidly followed. Rather, Cunningham is more interested in finding a balance between all corners of the canvas as seen in the variety of repetition found in this work.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Warm Afternoon at Broad Cove<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1955<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham painted with a collection of artist paint as well as commercial paint, such as housepaint. He was known to purchase cans of paint from yard sales, and have as many as twenty to thirty cans in his studio. It's possible that the pinks, greens, and yellows so prominent in his works, such as this one, are commercial paints.<br>

<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham often plays with the abstract power of color, which can be viewed in this work. This use of color is seen in Symbolist works, a movement including artists Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. In this way, Cunningham claimed for folk art various avant-garde concepts permeating popular culture.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1970<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham painted on Masonite, a naturally smooth material which allowed for enamel-like surfaces for his final products. He also worked to enhance this smooth surface through a variety of techniques: scratching through paint, feathered brushstrokes, underpainting, and heavy impasto. His preference for scratching and underpainting places him with Henri Matisse, as Matisse also made use of these techniques.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1955<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham had a strong desire for order, in his antique shop and his paintings. The limitations in his paintings, however, also provided him with the opportunity to play. His use of symmetrical themes allowed him to play with scale within the canvas itself, and make the elements he was most interested in larger, i.e. the birds, schooners, or plant life. This also gives the works more emotional investment.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1930<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Although Cunningham had a great amount of detail in each work, he maintained in interest in objects serving as symbols. Often, the sea served as a symbol of change and freedom, but the openness is held in check by surrounding land.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Dry Dock at Woodpecker Hollow<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1970<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham's view of the past can be seen as whimsical, but it was very serious for him. One of the most noticeable manipulation of timelines is his inclusion of Norse Viking ships, some of which can be seen here. Although they may have a source in popular media of the time, it's more likely these inclusions stem from the popular New England folklore about Leif Eriksson.<br>

<b>Significance:</b> Color was a primary consideration for Cunningham. He often meticulously planned out his paintings through sketching and drawing. Within these sketches, he would note the colors to be used: Orange Brown Sky and Water, Blue Sky and Water Some Greenish Yellow Sun Set.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Seminole Brown Water<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1950<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Viking ships share harbors with Native American canoes and Yankee schooners, and Seminole Indians shown paddling wear feather headdresses that look remarkably like those worn by the Passamaquoddy residents of Pleasant Point, Maine. Such juxtapositions suggest Cunningham's idealized view of an integrated nation, where life was simple and elements of modern life were absent.<br>

<b>Year:</b> 1950-1955<br>
<b>Significance:</b> A recurring theme in Cunningham's otherwise idyllic works is a bit of tragedy. Typically, as in this work, this appears in the form of fallen trees. These trees have been sawed rather than felled by natural means, and this is meant to symbolize human destruction.<br>

<b>Significance:</b> "In each painting, the Everglades represents a place of security and cultural purity, free of the incursions of modern civilization that for many meant the pollution of an ideal and peaceful world," observes curator Virginia Mecklenburg in "Earl Cunninham's America" (2007). She posits that Cunningham admired Seminoles because they, like himself, elected to live on their own terms.<br>

<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham was aware of his critics and was sometimes hurt by the remarks made about his art. One such criticism regarded the scale of his birds, particularly the flamingos, in relation to the houses and people, but he was not inclined to change this aspect of his paintings. He took comfort in Picasso's freedom of expression, which he often compared to his own.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> The Barbecue-Seminole Indian Style<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1960<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Cunningham felt a kinship with Native Americas, yet felt free to disregard tribal distinctions. In his works, Seminoles were just as likely to be shown in the customs of Plains Indians. In Maine, where Cunningham was born, tribal distinctions had disappeared and this may have led Cunningham to feel a similar kind of freedom.<br>

<b>Associated Artwork:</b> Seminole Village, Deep in the Everglades<br>
<b>Year:</b> 1965<br>
<b>Significance:</b> Around 1950, Cunningham was commissioned to create a now-lost series of works of Native Americans which were sold individually for large sums. This may have encouraged Cunningham to consider his works in terms of related ideas, and incentivized him to develop themes - like Maine, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina - which could provide more range and appeal for museums. It also allowed him to sustain his imaginary journeys away from the Over Fork Gallery.<br>
