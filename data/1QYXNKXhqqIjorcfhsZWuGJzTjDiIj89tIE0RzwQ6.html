<b>Name:</b> Bernard Veljacic<br>
<b>Age:</b> 42<br>
<b>City of residence:</b> Felida, Clark County<br>
<b>Party:</b> Non-Partisan<br>
<b>Relevant Experience:</b> I have protected our community as both Judge and as a Prosecutor. In 2009, while a prosecutor, I also began issuing decisions while on an administrative board. I tried cases in District, Juvenile, Superior and Federal District Court; I handled cases at the State and Federal Courts of Appeals.<br>
<b>Current occupation:</b> Clark County Superior Court Judge, Dept. 5     <br>
<b>Education:</b> Whittier College; J.D. - Seattle University; Trial Advocacy I, II – US Department of Justice National Advocacy Center<br>
<b>Top endorsements:</b> Clark County Sheriff Garry Lucas, Retired Clark County Prosecutor Art Curtis, 2013 Clark County First Citizen Bob Schaefer, Former Camas Mayor and Chair of Clark County Freeholders Nan Henriksen, Majority of Washington State Supreme Court Justices.<br>
<b>Amount of campaign money raised so far:</b> approximately $10,000 as of the end of July<br>
<b>Why do you believe you are a better choice than your opponent?:</b> I currently serve as Superior Court Judge because I underwent an exhaustive non-partisan, merit-based vetting by the Governor’s Office; I prevailed over my opponent and three others because I have prior experience presiding over cases, extensive litigation experience including complex federal trial work, and importantly, a calm and respectful demeanor.<br>
<b>As a judicial officer, which quality is more important: legal knowledge of judicial temperament? Why? (Please choose only one.):</b> A Judge really needs both.  Legal knowledge is important, but using that knowledge through an appropriate temperament, goes far to engender the public trust and provide access to justice.  On the contrary, a short tempered, impatient judge does very little to give a person their “day in court.”<br>
<b>What is your biggest criticism of the existing Superior Court bench?:</b> We have seen a huge increase in self-represented parties in Clark County (and state wide). These cases require more time and energy and they take longer to bring to trial; we lack the funding to provide assistance to the parties to prepare the cases for trial.<br>
<b>What do you foresee as potential challenges unique to the Clark County Superior Court in the next 10 years? What can be done to address those now?:</b> As population increases, we need to keep pace. We can anticipate more cases filed, increased demands on the judiciary, and a continuation of the upward trend in self-represented parties. Add to this that we will have and serve a more ethnically diverse and older group of litigants.  
We can implement a long-range plan that would identify several tools to address the issues raised above: technology to streamline court processes; improved relationships among state judicial officers to foster idea sharing; and education for judges, court administrators and clerks, all with the goal of doing more with limited resources.<br>
<b>Is there ever a scenario in which you would reject a plea deal negotiated between a prosecutor and defense attorney? Why or why not? What factors would you consider in making your decision?:</b> I would reject a deal if it did not meet standards for resolving cases.  One reason I am a judge is because I exercise discretion in the interests of justice and community safety. Ethically, I am barred from discussing a particular case, but the system depends upon judicial review.  
I would consider the facts of the case, and whether they satisfy the elements of the crime the defendant is pleading guilty to, victim input, the amount of discovery engaged in, as well as the similarity of the plea deal to like cases involving defendants with comparable criminal histories, among other factors.<br>
<b>How much would you assist those who don&#39;t have an attorney to represent them and are unfamiliar with the paperwork, processes and procedures of the court system?:</b> Judges are prohibited from giving legal advice and cannot put self-represented litigants in an advantageous position over the other party.  But I can point to helpful resources that are available: for example, The Clark County Volunteer Lawyers and Modest Means Programs, indigent defense counsel in certain cases, and Northwest Justice Project.
