<b>TERM:</b> Gender Identity<br>
<b>DEFINITION:</b> A person's internal sense of their gender. For transgender people, their own internal gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.

<b>TERM:</b> Gender Expression<br>

<b>TERM:</b> Transition<br>
<b>DEFINITION:</b> Altering one's birth sex is not a one-step procedure; it is a complex process that occurs over a long period of time. Transition can include some or all of the following personal, medical, and legal steps: telling one's family, friends, and co-workers; using a different name and new pronouns; dressing differently; changing one's name and/or sex on legal documents; hormone therapy; and possibly (though not always) one or more types of surgery. The exact steps involved in transition vary from person to person.
