That being said, we run 3-4 environmental science classes a year so I would like to be able to do this lab with every class, the only problem is that our school has very limited to no funding for this course so any sponsorship is very greatly appreciated! Thank you!

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> I would like to know if the water in our classroom is safe to drink. I have had parents and students ask the same question and I cannot positively tell them the answer! At the level I teach, I'm focusing on proper scientific procedure and the steps involved in proper testing. We have also recently had newspaper articles about the safety of the drinking water and this seems like an activity that will provide peace of mind for my students while also advancing the curricular goals. Seems like an engaging activity that would be informative in helping kids understand the importance of water quality.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> I think this will be a very interesting project for my students. We have been surrounded by forest fires for the better part of three months so it would be neat to test some water from different areas of town (the local lake, the marsh, a creek that runs through town, a river that runs through a piece of land that burned during the fires, tap water from different communities in the city, etc.). It will be interesting to see the different water and how the forest fires have affected it.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Water pollution is important, especially in Saskatchewan. Our students seem to know so much about endangered species, etc, but they typically don't know much about water pollution. It is an issue that affects us directly, especially as some of our reserves are under boil water advisories for years at a time. Would like to try it out first. Kits fit the curriculum and are hands-on. I received a kit last year, and used it with 2 of my classes. We did 6 or 7 of the lessons provided on your website. The students were very engaged and I found this to be a valuable resource. One student actually went on to do her major project on access to clean drinking water. Most students are unaware, for example, of drinking water issues on reserves. I would like to continue to use this learning resource and would like to have a second kit, so that more students can share and use the pH and TDS meters instead of having to wait and share just one.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Although I stated above that I teach at St. Lorenzo, the truth is I teach at twelve schools within the Greater Saskatoon Catholic School Division. St. Lorenzo is technically my home school. I teach students who are gifted in these twelve schools both in small groups and within their classrooms. With these kits, I can model the use of the kits and related lesson plans to the teachers with whom I collaborate. I am also excited to incorporate aspects of the Operation Water Spirit lesson plans as these support inclusion of an Indigenous perspective of water. Thank you for your time. It would be great to teach our students about Water Conservation and Sustainability. Fresh drinking water will be a sparse thing to come by in the future so we need to start preserving what we have today. We need to get the students thinking about this now.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Our school is located in a very diverse community with a relatively high proportion of new immigrants and students from various backgrounds. We strive to expose our students to all fields of science as much as possible as soon as they arrive in grade 7, to spark their interest and foster a love of science in general. Our school is also home to the only High School Specialization program in Sciences across our whole school board, if not the region, which means students apply to be part of an acclaimed, dynamic and efficient program that aims for excellence and enriches the education of highly motivated youth interested in biology, chemistry, health, etc. Being able to provide kits to our grade 7 and 8 kids enrolled in ``préconcentration scientifique`` is another example of how we can instill a desire for learning in the science field, how we can reach all youth, no matter their background. Being able to provide kits to our high school students is another example of how we can deepen their connection to the reality of current matters in class, how we can always provide first-hand experiences to ground their education.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We want to show our students the good quality of water that we get from our own taps, and hope that this discourages them to continue to drink bottled water. Our school's eco-team's focus last year, and again this year, is to reduce first, reuse second, and recycle last. We hope that this investigation will help them "buy out" of over use of bottled water. Four of the five classes participating are grade 7 and 8 students and we want to impact them so they can be leaders and positively influence the rest of the student body to go back to the tap!

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> The kit is an excellent fit for use when I teach the Water Systems unit that is part of the grade 8 Manitoba science curriculum. Two of the outcomes addressed in the unit are as follows: 8-4-15: Explain how and why water may need to be treated for use by humans. 8-4-17: Identify substances that may pollute water, related environmental and societal impacts of pollution, and ways to reduce or eliminate effects of pollution. Performing the water tests is an authentic way to learn real-life skills including measuring, testing, making observations, collaborating, etc..that are an important part of many jobs. Plus, any day the students get to wear their science lab coats and act like real scientists is a good day!

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We regularly attend the Water Festival in Essex County. This would be an incredible addendum to our study of water. We are located on a man-made lake that has supplied water to local areas. Part of the year, water that feeds the lake is diverted from the Bow River, which is the main water source for Calgary and our city. The diverted water passes through an industrial area, as well as some farm land. All the storm sewers from our city are dumped in the lake. It will be fantastic if we have the opportunity to measure and report the impacts of various factors that could impact the quality of the lake water. We will take samples from various locations along the water's journey to reach us. We will be able to compare the quality of the lake water to our drinking water and explore the process of converting it to make it safe.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Our school has begun to focus on sustainability as part of our broader exploration of Canadian waterways. As part of our curricular program, we are exploring Lake Winnipeg and the watershed (including the Red River) which feeds this major waterbody. Our focus will be on exploring short-term and long-term effects of elements, chemicals and pollution in our lakes and rivers, and the ways in which we can plan for our ecological future. Students will be comparing and testing local river water with freshwater aquarium water, as well as lake Winnipeg water. Students will also be developing filtration projects as part of our STEM initiative to remove harmful pollutants from the water. This would be an excellent opportunity for students to become engaged with their local community!

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> When I presented the opportunity to apply for these kits, my class excitedly brainstormed for about twenty minutes about what we could test. They would like to test water from the city (Windsor), the county (Amherstburg), rain water collected in a barrel, bottled water from a store and, finally, water from a Brita. They would like to chart, graph, compare and analyze the results and then try to investigate why any differences occur (looking at geology, source of water (Detroit River, ground, well, spring, tap, history of land use, etc). They would also like to use this project as an opportunity to apply the lessons completed during their "Solutions" unit which we will be starting in two weeks. I believe that as they progress through this process, they will come up with more ideas to explore. I would also like to say that I truly hope we can receive all of the kits requested as I believe the more science activities the students are exposed to, the more they will enjoy science and this will lead to a greater possibility that the students will persue a science career in the future. We are quite excited about this opportunity, we thank you for this opportunity and we hope we will be selected to receive these kits. Thank you!

Our science department has developed numerous hands-on activities for the grade 9 curriculum involving watersheds and ecological stewardship. Each year we run an average of 8 sections of grade 9 science. These kits would allow us to do a more in-depth study of our water sources which would be otherwise not affordable for the school. As a school we have launched a new International Baccalaureate (IB) program this year and these resources would allow these students to do valuable research into the tools and techniques in the field of environmental science.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We have become a STEAM school. We want to encourage students to be curious about their environment around them. We have also made a rule that students cannot bring in plastic water bottles so testing the water would prove educational.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Anytime I can get the students into the field and actually doing what we talk about, it is a bonus. I also like to introduce them to potential careers in science so they don't think that science is just sitting in a classroom, memorizing facts. Our students come from a rural setting, and several are avid outdoors enthusiasts. I want them to be aware that there are several science fields that would work well with that.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Unfortunately, our school has a limited budget for science supplies and resources. In the past, we have participated in local field trips offering water quality testing, but these trips often have to be cancelled due to inclement weather (fall and spring).

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> We are located on a man-made lake that has supplied water to local areas. Part of the year, water that feeds the lake is diverted from the Bow River, which is the main water source for Calgary and our city. The diverted water passes through an industrial area, as well as some farmland. All the storm sewers from our city are dumped in the lake. It would be fantastic if we were to have the opportunity to measure and report the impacts of various factors that could affect the quality of the lake water. We will take samples from various locations along the water's journey to reach us. We will be able to compare the quality of the lake water to our drinking water and explore the process of converting it to make it safe

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> The curriculum in Saskatchewan has many outcomes that are based on water properties, water quality, and water treatment/care. Water resources seem to be something we are short on and this is being reflected in how little our students know about water, water systems, where we get our potable water, and why it is important to care for and preserve our fresh water sources.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> This links directly with the curriculum in many science courses but also links directly to students' lives because we all depend on clean water to survive. This is such an important topic and the more we can make it relevant and real to students the more concerned and active they will become about preserving our water sources for future generations. It is imperative that our students understand the drinking water crisis; there is safe drinking water for all individuals across the globe. It is dire that our students not only are educated and gain a deeper understanding of the government regulations and their effectiveness/ineffectiveness toward safe drinking water, but also be able to evaluate the importance and apply laboratory techniques in the quantitative chemical analysis of water quality. With these kits, students will have the ability to conduct inquiry based learning, using the available technology or chemical tests, to detect the presence of inorganic substances in various samples of water. They will be able to not only evaluate and detect these inorganics in water samples, but also make predictions as to what natural process and/or human activities may have caused the results obtained. This process will allow our students to be critical thinkers; gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of the impacts of natural and human caused effects on the safety of our drinking water. I believe they have the potential to become citizens of change through this opportunity.

These kits would help us in the analysis of local water bodies and in providing students with the practical connection to their drinking water. Thanks for your consideration! We do not have good water. My dog will not even drink the water out of the tap (even though it is deemed safe to use). I have to use Brita filters. We buy bottled water. It stains our shower curtain, so I have to bleach it periodically. I would like to show the students why we are trying to get a better filtration system for our town. Our town administrator has received a lot of grants to fulfill this requirement.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> The Grade 5 team at Westmount this year is coming together to do a critical inquiry project on water. We are combining the science units of weather and wetlands along with the social studies focus on Canadian people and places to focus in on water usage and availability. We will study our local wetlands in Okotoks, their impact on our community, and our impact as humans on wetlands. We will find out the amount of water used by our school as well as each student's home and discuss the inquiry question "Is our water usage sustainable?". This will also connect to the very hot, dry summer we just had with water usage bans in place and forest fires all over British Columbia and parts of Alberta. Having the ability to test our water with these kits would allow us to incorporate grade 5 science- classroom chemistry concepts into our unit as well and further students' understanding of water and its importance. Being able to compare our water with that of other communities across Canada would allow students to see the need for clean drinking water and how privileged they are to have such easy access to clean drinking water. This could start a conversation about First Nations communities in Canada that do not have clean drinking water even though they are part of a first world country. Wouldn't it be neat if some schools in those communities received kits as well for us to compare our water quality?! The final goal of our inquiry would be that students take action in some way to educate others about water usage, cleanliness and respect for the water around us while being able to connect many of the learning outcomes for social studies and science together making their learning deeper and longer lasting.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> To be used with the Water units in grade 8 and the environmental unit in Sc 30 (and funds are short!). We live in an area of Alberta that has a lot of small lakes around that are prone to cyanobacteria. It is often a topic of interest among students. As a biology and chemistry teacher, I enjoy cross curricular activities and lessons where students can apply and use their knowledge from both subject areas. It enables students a deeper understanding of the content with hands-on learning. Since our school is located in a fairly rural area, we have a variety of water sources from well water to treated water to test. I think this would be a fantastic learning opportunity for students!

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Currently, we are building up our science program and spent monetary resources on glassware and chemicals. At this time, there aren't additional funds for additional supplies. We would be very appreciative of any kits that you can provide. Our budget does not allow us to purchase many science materials so our labs are limited. We spend a whole unit on water. It would be so wonderful to make this a hands-on and engaging experience for our kids. Also, because we have such a large student body, other organizations that offer field trip opportunities will not take us. We would have to break up our students and staff over multiple days and this is just not feasible in junior high. This would give us a great opportunity to reach all of our kids in a smaller setting with each individual teacher presenting it. Thank you so much for this opportunity.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Without receipt of the sponsored kits, we will not be able to do as extensive hands-on coverage of the related content (as we do not have funds to access to purchase the kits ourselves). Giving our children the ability to experience both the process and ability to do this testing themselves will greatly enhance not only their understanding but their appreciation for, and connection with, the subject matter.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> I teach a group of teen moms, helping them to achieve their high school diploma in order to better their lives and the lives of their children. I teach everything: English, math, science, life and parenting skills, social justice, and much, much more. In order to reach these students - who are high-risk students with many learning challenges, and who have experienced trauma - I use hands-on, real-world activities to engage them. These water testing kits are relevant, immediate, and authentic learning, which would greatly benefit and interest my students.

<b>Why do you want to receive sponsored kits?:</b> Our school is on a First Nation Reserve, where our tap water is currently not potable, and has never been in the 10 years I've taught here. We don't use it for drinking at all. Currently, our water plant is being upgraded to improve our water quality. Access to safe water is an ongoing issue in First Nations, and I think should be "on the table" more in our classrooms--everyone here takes the non-potable water as status quo. (For example, I haul my own drinking water for the Teacherage from an Artesian Spring that is 1.5 hours from here.) I'm teaching Grade 4/5 this year, but we have a 5/6 and several other classes at the high school end who'd be interested in this issue also. We are a Nursery to Grade 12 school with about 250 students. (I am asking for kits for several other teachers, which I will forward to them.)
