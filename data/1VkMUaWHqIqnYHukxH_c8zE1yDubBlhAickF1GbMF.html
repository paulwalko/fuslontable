I shared an airport shuttle with other attendees. The shuttle driver dropped off everyone else at their hotels, then asked me, "Sister, could I show you my neighborhood?" It was late, nearly dark, and he drove me around for 15-20 minutes, on a ghostly tour of destroyed homes, streets where all you heard was crickets and all you saw was the shining eyes of critters scuttling along, past cars that had been pushed up onto porches by the Katrina floodwaters and were still there, nearly a year later. It was eerie and sad and shocking, and it was right here in America.</a><br>

We spent most of our time here in high school as it was located so closely to the beach. I couldn't believe how it looked once I returned after the hurricane. The property and the street it was located on were completely unrecognizable and I had a hard time even finding where the house once was since all of the familiar landmarks were gone.</a><br>

With street signs blown away and no houses left on the street, it was hard to tell exactly where things use to be. I would drive down streets I knew my entire life and had no idea where I was because everything that was familiar was now gone. This photo shows how people began spray painting their addresses on debris to help people know where they were.</a><br>

The cottage was washed away by the 30+ foot storm surge that hit her neighborhood. The van is sitting where the cottage was and we have no clue who the van belongs to. Many of the people in Waveland, MS did not evacuate and stayed in their homes during the storm. Anyone who lived "south of the train tracks" where this cottage was located was actually visited by the local police department who enforced a mandatory evacuation, obviously for good reasons.</a><br>

This meant no A/C in late August and September. This photo was taken after my brothers and dad had cleared some of the fallen trees in the yard. My brother made a make-shift hammock out of fallen trees and a fishing net. This helped him stay cool at night while he slept and also allowed him to guard our home from looters. </a><br>

My youngest brother opened the front door of our home once the water stopped rising in the house in the hopes of speeding up the process of getting the water out of the house. When he finally was able to open the door, there was such much water trying to rush out of the house through the front door that it created a current that started to sweep him away and out of the house. My other brother was able to grab him and pull him back into the house in time and the water soon receded from the house.</a><br>

As you can see, the refrigerator turned into a flotation device and began floating all throughout the house. Unseen in this photo is the china cabinet that was kept in the corner of the kitchen. In the bottom of that china cabinet were storage cabinets where all of my brother's and my baby photos were stored. When the house first began to fill with water, my family rushed to try and save the baby photos. A good number of them were thrown into the blue storage bin in the photo but most were lost in the water. </a><br>

It was three stories high with a pool and a pool house and was the most impressive home my high school friends and I had ever been in. Since it was the largest home I knew of in our home town, I passed by the property a few weeks after the hurricane. I couldn't believe that there was absolutely nothing left where this massive home once was. There wasn't even any debris on the property. The only thing left was the cement stairs that led from the front yard down to the beach.</a><br>

My colleagues and I got together on Friday afternoon at the end of our first week back in school.  No one was really talking about the storm.  I lived on Bienville in Mid City and spent the entire day, Saturday, the 27th, preparing my home to stay.  Finally around 9pm I had time to turn on the news.  When I saw the National Weather rep., the Mayor and the Governor all looking very scared as well as the satellite image of the storm taking up the entire gulf, I decided to GO.  I left my home with 3 days of clothing at 11 pm that night and drove all night to Austin, Tx.  On Tues. after the storm had passed but I saw that the levees had been breached I called my tenants.  They said the house was fine but there was water in the street!  I told them to get out and go to Lindy Boggs Hospital.  They waded there and were helicoptered out of NO from Bayou St. John.   The street had 6 feet of water, my house had 4 feet.  I had left Mid City.  It took days to find friends, many of whom had stayed and endured far more than I.</a><br>

of  algiers  to traverse across  the greater new orleans bridge  for my first and omly time in my 28 years that i livved in n o ! no  fear of arrest  by police and no real competing  automotive  traffic ..... it was pretty much...all    pedestrian  traffic  on the fabled  GNO bridge   all ferry service on the ol man river was  savaged!! when i got to the ordered destination, the now  devstated  new orleans  convention center.......... me and several hundreds or maybe a thousand or whatever were  sort of  cooped up in a less than comfortable  but  otherwise safe  bldg.  rumor had it that there was sum  breakdown of law and order and it may have been that the less nobler  facets of human  nature may have wreaked sum  havoc....... i myself   never saw of such  outrite   ugliness and i am  grateful... the superdome,new orleams  pride and joy for many  years, was allegedly  destroyed by both the storm  and the negative aspect of  human  nature,or so i  hav  ben  told!!! none of us suffereed for want....we did get  decent supplies of food, and sanitary aids!!! in good time, i  saw many  different   divisions of various  army and  air  national  guards of various  U.S. states finally patrolling  new orleanian  streets  and i was even intervued by sum  well spoken central european  journalist...i think that he was a german  newsman.  the fundamental  question facing us  katrinans  was when we were all going to leev n o, and wherer  for sum  5  long days !!!    Surprise! i didnt  haf  to  wait  up to  labor day or beyond...on  5  sept or  afterwards!!!  it would be at last day of the calendar week of  katrina,, 28  august  to  3 sept in 2005.......of  course, sat, 3  sept,in 2005!  I  was heading to a new life to the west...west of  louisiana,similar  to my ancestors in long ago  prairie wagons  one hundred   years before i  were born ... only that i were airlifted and not traveling on the ground!!!  Literally   thank  God Almighty !!!!!!!
