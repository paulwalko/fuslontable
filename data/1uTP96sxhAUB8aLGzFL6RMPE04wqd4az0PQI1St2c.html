<b>Title:</b> The <em>Man and Matter</em> series<br>
<b>Artist:</b> Peter D Cole<br>
<b>Suburb:</b> Kangaroo Point<br>
<b>Address:</b> Kangaroo Point Cliffs Boardwalk, Lower River Terrace<br>
<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.47958, 153.03332<br>
<b>Description:</b> The <em>Man and Matter</em>  series consists of 12 steel sculptures installed along the Kangaroo Point Cliffs Boardwalk. Originally, these sculptures were commissioned for the riverside promenade of Brisbane’s World Expo '88.<p>Referencing the World Expo &#39;88 theme of ‘Leisure in the Age of Technology’, Cole considers the relationships between humans and technology through simple visual symbology and the redressing of traditional limitations of sculpture. </p><p>The iconic red figures are a lasting homage to World Expo '88, and a recognition of Brisbane’s advancement into the 21st century.</p><p>This artwork has recently been restored, as part of Council’s artwork restoration and relocations works for the 30th anniversary.</p><br>

<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.471455, 153.017779<br>
<b>Description:</b> Created by acclaimed American sculptor Jon Barlow Hudson, this work is a sectional model of his <em>Paradigm</em> sculpture, which was created for Brisbane's Expo '88.<p>
The original <em>Paradigm</em> sculpture was constructed of stainless steel, measured 30 metres in height, and was a dominant feature outside the USA pavilion at the northern end of the Expo site. <em>Paradigm</em> was based on the double helix of the DNA molecule, and during Expo '88 it housed 66 aeroplane landing lights, making it a memorable feature of Brisbane's night-time landscape.</p><br>

<b>Title:</b> <em>Vision</em><br>
<b>Artist:</b> John Ladyman<br>
<b>Suburb:</b> South Brisbane<br>
<b>Address:</b> Manning Street<br>
<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.476389, 153.014648<br>
<b>Description:</b> Commissioned for World Expo '88 and now in a private collection.

<p>The marble used to create <em>Vision</em> comes from the mines around Chillagoe, a small town 200km inland from Cairns where the artist lived from 1885-1988.</p>

<p>Describing the carving process as essentially one directional decision-making process. Once acted upon, the decision to remove more material is irrevocable. For this reason, as the work develops, a heightened state of awareness develops along with it.</p><br>

<b>Title:</b> <em>The Art of Central Australia</em><br>
<b>Artist:</b> Papunya painters<br>
<b>Suburb:</b> South Brisbane<br>
<b>Address:</b> Plaza Gallery, Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre<br>
<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.476484, 153.018374<br>
<b>Description:</b> The paintings in this gallery were originally commissioned for display at World Expo '88. They represent a style of Aboriginal painting that emerged from one of the most remarkable developments in 20th century art. In the early 1970s, 250 kilometres west of Alice Springs at the Aboriginal settlement of Papunya, artists began to paint their traditional designs using modern art materials.

<p>John Truscott, the Creative Director of Expo '88, originally proposed the idea of commissioning paintings by Aboriginal artists from the central desert for an Expo display at South Bank. The 27 paintings were assembled in 1987. They were installed as part of the Expo Authority’s own pavilion and were displayed outdoors, under protective sails, in a spiral arrangement devised by Truscott. The collection was called <em>The Art of Central Australia</em>.</p>

<p>Note: The Gallery is occasionally closed for functions.</p><br>

<b>Suburb:</b> Toowong<br>

<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.479147, 152.979674<br>
<b>Description:</b> A joint project between Brisbane City Council, World Expo ‘88, Men of the Trees and Greening Australia, the Rainforest Grove is the only remanent of Expo ’88 still in its original location. Planted just prior to the commencement of Expo ‘88, the Rainforest Grove was a beautification project.
The Brisbane City Council undertook many street and park beautification projects, mostly on routes from the Airport to the CBD.
One exception was the Expo ‘88 Rainforest Grove, undertaken at Mt Coot-tha, as it expected to see a tourist influx during the Expo period.<br>

<b>Title:</b> <em>Great Planet</em><br>
<b>Artist:</b> Inge King<br>
<b>Suburb:</b> South Brisbane<br>
<b>Address:</b> Gallery 5, Queensland Art Gallery<br>
<b>Latitude and Longitude:</b> -27.472735, 153.018318<br>
<b>Description:</b> A leading Australian exponent of abstract sculpture, Inge King's <em>Great Planet</em> 1976-77 exemplifies a great simplicity of form, which belies its physical weight. When King began welding in 1959 - one of only a handful of women artists in the field - she used steel (the industrial material of her age) in an expressionist manner, leaving exposed the rugged texture of the welding. Over the years, this texture eventually disappeared and her forms became simpler and more monumental. Beyond its formally satisfying design, <em>Great Planet</em> has an air of mystery, an aura of power and a commanding presence. The sculpture was lent to Expo '88 from the Queensland Art Gallery's collection.

Note: <em>Great Planet</em> is part of the QAGOMA Geometries exhibition, on display within the Queensland Art Gallery building until 2 February 2020. Opening hours: 10am-5pm daily.<br>
