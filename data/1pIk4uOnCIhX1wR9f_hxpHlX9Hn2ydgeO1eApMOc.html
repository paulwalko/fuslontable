<b>Description:</b> <strong>Minnesota</strong><br><p> The  Dakota name Minnesota  (<a href="">Hear</a> it pronounced in Dakota)  means sky-tinted water (<i>Minne</i>, water, and <i>sota</i>, somewhat clouded), as Rev. Edward D. Neill translated it on the authority of Rev. Gideon H. Pond. The river at its stages of flood becomes whitishly turbid. An illustration of the meaning of the words was told to the present writer by Mrs. Moses N. Adams, the widow of the well-known missionary of the Dakotas. She stated that at various times the Dakota women explained it to her by dropping a little milk into water and calling the whitishly clouded water""Minne sota</p><p>In the years 1846-48, Hon. Henry H. Sibley and Hon. Morgan L. Martin, the delegate in Congress from Wisconsin, proposed this name for the new territory, which thus followed the example of Wisconsin in adopting the title of a large stream within its borders. During the next few years, it displaced the name St. Peter as applied in common usage by the white people to the river, whose euphonious Dakota title will continue to be borne by the river and the state.</p><p>Jonathan Carver, who wintered with the Dakota on the Minnesota River.  In 1766-67, was the earliest author to record its Dakota name. He spelled it Menesotor in his <i>Travels through the Interior Parts of North America</i> and Menesoter on the accompanying map. It was spelled Menesota by Long and William H. Keating; MenisothT by Giacomo C. Beltrami; Minisotah by Nicollet; Minnay sotor by George W. Featherstonhaugh; Minesota by Hon. M. L. Martin and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas in bills introduced by them respectively in the House and Senate for organization of the territory; and Minnesota by Hon. H. H. Sibley at the Stillwater convention.</p><p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

Williamson wrote, "on both sides; applied by founders to the city laid out on both sides of Rum River, and since applied to the county," of which this city is the county seat. Rev. Moses N. Adams, who came as a missionary to the Dakota in 1848 and learned their language, stated that as a Dakota word, Anoka means "the other side, or both sides."<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Artichoke</strong> is in Big Stone County <br>ARTICHOKE Township, whose first settler came in May 1869, received its name from the former Artichoke Lake, now drained, which was five miles long, stretching from section 11 south to section 36. This name was probably translated from the Dakota name of the lake, referring to the edible tuber roots of a species of sunflower (Helianthus tuberosus), which was much used by the Indians as food, called pangi by the Dakota, abundant here and common or frequent throughout this state. The village Artichoke, in section 11, had a post office, known in Artichoke Lake, 1876-1913; Nels Johnson was the first postmaster and also the town treasurer.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Big Stone</strong> is in Big Stone County <br>This county, established February 20, 1862, and organized April 13, 1874, derived its name from Big Stone Lake, through which the Minnesota River flows on the west boundary of the county and state. It is a translation of the Dakota name, alluding to the conspicuous outcrops of granite and gneiss, extensively quarried, which occur in the Minnesota valley from a half mile to three miles below the foot of the lake. The city and county building in Minneapolis is constructed of the stone from these quarries, which also supplied four massive columns of the state capitol rotunda, on its north and south sides. The Dakota name, poorly pronounced and indistinctly heard, was written Eatakeka by William H. Keating in his Narrative of Stephen H. Long's expedition in 1823, but Prof. A. W. Williamson more correctly spelled it in two words, Inyan tankinyanyan, the first meaning "stone," the second "very great," as shown by the repetition of the first word and duplication of its final syllable.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Toqua</strong> is in Big Stone County <br><p>TOQUA Township (formerly spelled Tokua), first settled in 1877 and organized March 16, 1880, received its name from the two Tokua Lakes in Graceville and the similar pair of lakes in this township, which latter were called by the Dakota, as translated, the Tokua Brothers Lakes. This aboriginal name is spelled Ta Kara on Joseph N. Nicollet's map, 1843, Ta being the Dakota word for the moose, while Kara doubtless refers to the Kahra band of the Dakota.</p><p>Nicollet also used the word Kara as the final part of other names, Plan Kara and Manstitsa Kara, given on his map to two points or hillocks of the valley bluff east of the northern end of Lake Traverse. Stephen R. Riggs, however, in his Dakota dictionary published in 1852, rejected all use of the letter r in that language, so that the name Kahra or Kara may not be identifiable in that work. Tokua (or Toqua) was the white men's endeavor to spell the Dakota name for these pairs of lakes, which Nicollet spelled as Ta Kara.</p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Mankato</strong> is in Blue Earth County <br><p>The Dakota name is retained, with slight change, by the township and city of Mankato. On the earliest map of Minnesota Territory, in 1850, it appeared as Mahkahta for one of its original nine counties, reaching from the Mississippi above the Crow Wing west to the Missouri.</p> <p>MANKATO Township was established April 6, 1858, and was organized in connection with the present city of Mankato, May 11, 1858. The city charter was adopted March 24, 1868, and the first election of the township, separate from the city, was held April 7, 1868. The first settlement of Mankato and of this county was in February 1852 by Parsons King Johnson, and on the 14th of that month the Blue Earth Settlement Claim Association was organized in St. Paul by Henry Jackson, P. K. Johnson, Col. D. A. Robertson, Justus C. Ramsey, brother of the governor of the territory, and others. Hughes writes of their choice of the name for the settlement to be founded, as follows: "The honor of christening the new city was accorded to Mrs. P. K. Johnson and Mrs. Henry Jackson, who selected the name 'Mankato,' upon the suggestion of Col. Robertson. He had taken the name from Nicollet's book, in which the French explorer compared the 'Mahkato' or Blue Earth River, with all its tributaries, to the water nymphs and their uncle in the German legend of 'Undine.' . . . No more appropriate name could be given the new city, than that of the noble river at whose mouth it is located."</p><p>Growth of the community was attributed to transportation, as four railroads met in Mankato. In 1880 the city was fourth in size in the state, with a population of 5,500, and supported a number of industries: machine shops, flour, feed, and planing mills, a woolen mill, linseed oil works, several carriage and wagon factories, four breweries, a pottery and brick yards, three newspapers, and fourteen churches. The community is the site of Bethany Lutheran College, founded in 1927; and Minnesota State University--Mankato, which began as a normal school, 1867-1921, teachers college, 1921-57, state college, 1957-75, and state university since 1975.</p><p>Hear Mankato spoken as <a href="http://www.beginningdakota.org/audio/24_15.mp3">Makato</a></p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Medo</strong> is in Blue Earth County <br>MEDO, a township of the Winnebago reservation, was named by the county commissioners April 16, 1858, but it was not organized until September 2, 1863. This is a Dakota word meaning a species of plant (Apios tuberosa), which has roots that bear small tubers much used by the Indians as food. It is common or frequent through the south half of this state, extending north to the upper Mississippi River. Dr. Charles C. Parry, with David D. Owen's geological survey in 1848, wrote of it as "Pomme de Terre of the French voyageurs; Mdo, or wild potato, of the Sioux Indians." It is also called ground-nut because its nutlike tubers grow in a series along the root. Medo, a village in section 9, had a post office, 1866-1904, a sawmill, a feed mill, a wagon maker, two general stores, and a hotel.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Minneopa</strong> is in Blue Earth County <br><p>MINNEOPA, a village in South Bend Township, section 20, was settled in 1876 and named from the falls nearby in the Minneopa River. The name is a contraction of a Dakota word meaning "follows the water, two waterfalls." A station of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway was in section 21.</p><p>The state legislature in 1905 provided for the purchase of land containing the Minneopa Falls on the creek of this name in South Bend Township, about four miles west of Mankato, for public use as a state park. Its area is about 60 acres, comprising the falls, two near together, of 60 feet descent, with the gorge below. The railway station and townsite, named Minneopa, close to the falls, were platted in September 1870.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Pleasant Mound</strong> is in Blue Earth County <br>PLEASANT MOUND Township was first named Otsego, April 6, 1858, but on October 14 of that year it was renamed Willow Creek, "probably an eastern name familiar to some old settler." There is a creek of this name in the east part of the township, flowing northeast into the Blue Earth River. A village named Pleasant Mound, first settled in 1857 in section 26, had a post office established in 1863 at the home of F. O. Marks, near a series of hills of drift gravel, called kames, in section 25, which then was moved to section 26 in the home of John S. Parks. The Dakota name of these hills, according to Hughes, was Ichokse or Repah Kichakse, meaning "to cut in the middle, perhaps from the fact that the ridge is divided into a number of mounds, or it may mean 'thrown down or dumped in heaps,' as the spelling is uncertain." September 6, 1865, this township was organized and was given its present name, on the suggestions of Marks and Parks, taken like that of the post office from the knolly gravel ridge.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

The township merged on May 8, 1967, with the village of Watertown. The city of Chanhassen, sections 12 and 13, and extending into Hennepin County, was incorporated as a village on April 25, 1896; its post office, 1854-63, began in Hennepin County and transferred to Carver County in 1857.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Rice</strong> is in Clearwater County <br>Rice Lake and the Upper Rice Lake, and the Wild Rice River, have probably borne these names in four successive languages, the Dakota , the Ojibwe, French, and English. The oldest printed reference is in the narrative of Joseph La France, a French and Ojibwe parentage, who in 1740-42 traveled and hunted with the Indians of a large region in northwestern Minnesota and in Canada northward to Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba and Hudson Bay. In the story of his wandering, given by Arthur Dobbs in An Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson's Bay, published in London in 1744, La France described the Upper Rice Lake, in Bear Creek and Minerva Townships of this county, as follows: "The Lake Du Siens is but small, being not above 3 Leagues in Circuit; but all around its Banks, in the shallow Water and Marshes, grows a kind of wild Oat, of the Nature of Rice; the outward Husk is black, but the Grain within is white and clear like Rice; this the Indians beat off into their Canoes, and use it for Food" (Minnesota in Three Centuries, 1908, vol. 1, pp. 299-302). This French name, Du Siens, seems probably to be from the Dakota word psin, meaning "wild rice."<p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Castle Rock</strong> is in Dakota County <br>CASTLE ROCK Township, organized April 6, 1858, was named, on the suggestion of Peter Ayotte, an early settler, for a former well-known landmark, a pillar or towerlike remnant, spared by erosion and weathering, of "a sandstone rock which stands alone on a prairie in that town. This geologic formation, before its partial disintegration which left it in ruins, closely resembled a castle." Nicollet's Report, in 1843, gives its Dakota name, Inyan bosndata, Standing Rock, which, he adds, on the authority of Pierre Charles Le Sueur in the year 1700, was the Dakota name also of the Cannon River. Prof. N. H. Winchell's "Final Report of the Geology of Minnesota," in vol. 2, 1888, has a good description and historical notice of Castle Rock in chapter 3 (pp. 76-79), "The Geology of Dakota County," with three pictures of it from photographs. Its height was 44 feet above the ground at its base, and 70 feet above an adjoining hollow, but the slender pillar, 19 feet high, forming its upper part, fell in about 1900. The village of Castle Rock, section 31, had a post office, first named Vermillion in 1855, changing to Castle Rock in 1858-95; it had a station of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Dakota</strong> County <br><p>This county, established October 27, 1849, was named for the Dakota people, meaning an alliance or league. Under this name are comprised a large number of allied and affiliated Indian tribes, who originally occupied large parts of Minnesota and adjoining states. The Dakota called themselves collectively by this name, but they have been frequently termed Sioux, this being a contraction from the appellation Nadouesioux, given with various spellings by Pierre E. Radisson, Father Louis Hennepin, and Robert Cavalier, sieur de la Salle , a term evidently of Algonquianorigin, adopted by the early French explorers and traders.</p><p>Radisson says (Voyages, p. 154) that the first part of the Algonquian name for the Dakota, spelled, in the translation of his manuscript, Nadoneceronons, means an enemy. Rev. Moses N. Adams informed me that the Dakota dislike to be called Sioux and much prefer their own collective name, borne by this county, which implies friendship or even brotherly love.</p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Pine Island</strong> is in Goodhue County <br>"The island proper is formed by the middle branch of the Zumbro, which circles around the present village, enclosing a tract once thickly studded with tall pine trees. . . . This spot was one of the favorite resorts of the Dakota Indians. They called it Wa-zee-wee-ta, Pine Island, and here in their skin tents they used to pass the cold winter months, sheltered from the winds and storms by the thick branches of lofty pines. The chief of Red Wing's village told the commissioners of the United States, when asked to sign the treaty that would require his people to relinquish their home on the Mississippi River, that he was willing to sign it if he could have his future home at Pine Island" (Hancock, p. 288). "Between the two branches of the Zumbro River, which unite a short distance below, there was quite a forest of pine, which could be seen for a long distance over the prairie, giving it quite the appearance of an Island in the sea" (Mitchell, p. 118).<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Zumbrota</strong> is in Goodhue County <br>ZUMBROTA, settled in 1854, organized in 1858, received the name of its village, platted in September 1854, on the Zumbro River, which flows across the southern part of this township. The Dakota named this river Wazi Oju, meaning Pines Planted, having reference to the grove of great white pines at Pine Island, before noticed; and it bears this name on Nicollet's map, 1843, and the map of Minnesota Territory in 1850. It was called Riviere d'Embarras and River of Embarrassments by Pike, 1805-6, adopting the name given it by the early French traders and voyageurs; Embarrass River by Maj. Long, 1817; and Embarras, the more correct French spelling, by Albert M. Lea's map, 1836. From the reminiscences written by Lea in 1890 of his explorations, we learn that the French name referred to obstruction of the river near its mouth by a natural raft of driftwood. Pronounced quickly and incompletely, with the French form and accent, as heard and written down by the English-speaking immigrants, this name, RiviFre des Embarras, was unrecognizably transformed into Zumbro, which is used on the map of Minnesota in 1860. The village and township name adds a syllable, the Dakota suffix ta, meaning "at, to, or on," that is, the town on the Zumbro, being thus a compound from the French and Dakota languages.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Pomme de Terre</strong> is in Grant County <br>POMME DE TERRE Township, organized July 17, 1877, took the name of the large lake at its southeast border, whence also the Pomme de Terre River, flowing from it to the Minnesota River, was named. It is received from the early French voyageurs and traders, meaning literally apple of the earth, that is, a potato, but it was here applied to the edible ovoid-shaped root of the wild turnip (Psoralea esculenta), called Tipsinah by the Dakota. This much esteemed aboriginal food plant, very valuable to these Indians, formerly was common on dry and somewhat gravelly parts of upland prairies throughout southwestern Minnesota. The old village of Pomme de Terre, in section 24, platted in 1874, was the first village in the county, then superseded by railway towns. A post office was located in section 24, 1868-79 and 1880-1902, first established in Stevens County, with a station of the Soo Line.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Wayzata</strong> is in Hennepin County <br>This name was formed by slight change from Waziyata, a Dakota word meaning "at the pines, the north." Wazi is defined as "a pine, pines," and Waziya, "the northern god, or god of the north; a fabled giant who lives at the north and blows cold out of his mouth. He draws near in winter and recedes in summer." The suffix ta, denotes "at, to, on" (Riggs, Dictionary of the Dakota Language, 1852, pp. 192, 239). The name Wayzata, originated by white men, refers to the location at the north side of the east end of Lake Minnetonka, not to pine trees, which are found nearest, in very scanty numbers, on the Mississippi bluffs at Dayton and on Bassett's and Minnehaha Creeks in Minneapolis.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Hokah</strong> is in Houston County <br>HOKAH Township, settled in 1851, organized May 11, 1858, bears the Dakota name of the Root River, which is its English translation. Hutkan is the spelling of the word by Stephen R. Riggs and Dr. Thomas S. Williamson in their Dakota dictionaries, 1852 and 1902, but it is spelled Hokah on the map by Joseph N. Nicollet, published in 1843, and on the map of Minnesota Territory in 1850. A part of the site of the village, which was platted in March 1855, had been earlier occupied by the village of a Dakota leader named Hokah. This railway village was incorporated March 2, 1871. The city of Hokah reincorporated on April 23, 1923, and separated from the township. It was first settled by Edward Thompson, who built a sawmill in 1852, a flour mill in 1853, and a dam in 1866 across the Root River in anticipation of the Southern Minnesota Railroad coming; the railroad caused the population to increase tenfold. Thompson Creek south of Hokah andMt. Tom are named for Thompson. Part of the city was called Slab Town for the houses built on slabs from the sawmill. The post office began in 1856.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Lac qui Parle</strong> is in Lac qui Parle County <br><p>This county was established March 6, 1871. Nine years earlier a county bearing this name but of entirely different area, situated north of the Minnesota River, had been authorized by a legislative act, February 20, 1862, but it was not ratified by the people. This French name, meaning "the Lake that Talks," is translated from the Dakota name, Mde Iyedan (mde, lake; iye, speaks; dan, a diminutive suffix), applied to the adjacent lake, which is an expansion of the Minnesota River. The lake, nearly 10 miles long with a maximum width of 1 mile and a maximum depth of 12 feet, owes its existence to the deposition of alluvium from the Lac qui Parle River, which enters the Minnesota valley near the foot of the lake. Its name most probably was suggested to the Dakota by echoes thrown back from its bordering bluffs. Prof. Andrew W. Williamson wrote: "It is very uncertain how it received the name; one tradition says from an echo on its shores, but it is doubtful if any such existed; another tradition is that when the Dakotas first came to the lake voices were heard, but they found no speakers; some think the word has changed its form." The Qu' Appelle River in Saskatchewan, also a French translation of its Indian name, having nearly the same significance, "the River that Calls," is similarly enclosed by somewhat high bluffs, likely to reply to a loud speaker by echoes.</p><p>Rev. Moses N. Adams, who during our territorial period resided as a missionary at Lac qui Parle, told of a very remarkable creaking, groaning, and whistling of the ice on the lake in winter and spring, due to fluctuations of the water level allowing the ice to rise and fall, grating upon the abundant boulders of the shores. At the same time these strange sounds are echoed and reverberate from the enclosing bluffs. To these "voices" he ascribed the Dakota and French name.</p><p>Keating mapped the Lac qui Parle River as Beaver Creek, adopting this name from the fur traders. His narrative adds that the Dakota called it Watapan intapa, "the river at the head," because they considered Lac qui Parle as the head of the Minnesota River, probably referring rather to the limit of favorable canoe travel during the usually low stage of water in the summer.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Minneota</strong> is in Lyon County <br>MINNEOTA, a city in Eidsvold Township, sections 25, 26, 35, and 36, which was incorporated on January 21, 1881. It was first known locally as Pumpa, so designated by early Norwegian settlers because of the railroad water pump, and then called Upper Yellow Medicine Crossing for its location. It was platted as Nordland village by the Winona and St. Peter Railroad in August 1876; when the post office was established in 1878, it was given the name Nordland, with railroad section boss Harvey D. Frink, postmaster, at his homestead store on railroad land, located on the left side of the tracks west of Yellow Medicine Creek; when the railroad built its depot on the right side of the tracks and other buildings went up nearby, the post office moved to new postmaster Nils Winther Luth Jaeger's store, and the name changed to Minneota, as suggested by Thomas D. Seals, another storekeeper. Jaeger was born in Norway in 1841, came to Minnesota in 1868 and to Lyon County in 1874, and was prominent in business for many years. The name Minneota is a Dakota name, meaning "much water." Prof. A. W. Williamson wrote of its origin, that it is "said to be so named by an early settler on account of an abundance of water flowing into his well."    <a href="http://www.beginningdakota.org/audio/24_4.mp3" target="_blank">Hear</a> it pronounced in Dakota. <p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Mille Lacs</strong> County and Lake<br>The ten southern townships of this county, Dailey, Mudgett, Page, Hayland, Milaca, Borgholm, Milo, Bogus Brook, Greenbush, and Princeton, were known as Monroe County until Mille Lacs County was established in 1860. The county was named for the large lake, called Mille Lacs, meaning a thousand lakes, which is crossed by the north boundary of the county. It was named Lac Buade by Father Louis Hennepin in 1680, for the family name of Count Frontenac. By the Dakota it was called Mde Wakan, that is, Wonderful Lake or Spirit Lake. Pierre Charles Le Sueur's journal, written in 1700 and 1701 and transcribed by Bernard de la Harpe, states that the large part of the Dakota who lived there received from this lake their distinctive tribal name, spelled, by La Harpe, Mendeouacantons. The same name, with better spelling, was given by William H. Keating in 1823, and the lake, on the map accompanying his Narrative, is named Spirit Lake, but this group of the Dakota, the Mdewakanton, had before that time been driven from the Mille Lacs region by the Ojibwe and then lived along the Mississippi.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Wahkon</strong> is in Mille Lacs County <br>WAHKON, a city in section 17 of Isle Harbor Township, was incorporated as a village on November 6, 1912; it was established in 1885 as Potts Town, changed to Lawrence in 1891 when the post office was established, and changed again in 1910 to Wahkon. This name is the Dakota name of Mille Lacs, spelled wakan in the Dakota dictionary by Rev. Stephen R. Riggs, defined as "spiritual, sacred, consecrated, wonderful, incomprehensible." The Dakota applied this name especially to a very remarkable but small island far out in the lake, about seven miles northwest from Wahkon, consisting of rock, granitic boulders piled by the ice of the lake to a height of nearly 20 feet, a noted resort of gulls and pelicans, called on maps Spirit Island or Pelican Island. Only 1 or 2 feet below the lake level, and visible under the water for 100 feet or more to the north and east, is a ledge of the bedrock described by David I. Bushnell in Brower's memoir of Mille Lac (p. 121, with a picture, on p. 118, of the heaped rock masses forming the island). Wonderful as the island is, it was the origin of the Dakota name of the lake, of this village, and, by a punning perversion noted on a later page, the name of the Rum River.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Swan Lake</strong> is in Nicollet County <br>Nicollet Creek, flowing south through Nicollet Township to the Minnesota, is the outlet of the large Swan Lake, which Nicollet mapped as Marrah Tanka (for maga, goose, tanka, great), the Dakota name of the swan. William H. Keating, in the Narrative of Long's expedition in 1823, wrote of this lake, "The Indian name is Manha tanka otamenda, which signifies the lake of the many large birds." Two species, the trumpeter swan and the whistling swan, were formerly found in Minnesota. The first nests here, but the second, which yet is rarely seen in this state, has its breeding grounds far north of our region.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Okabena</strong> is in Nobles County <br><p>WORTHINGTON, a city in sections 23-26 of Worthington Township and the county seat, platted in the summer of 1871, was incorporated as a village March 8, 1873, and as a city in 1912. Its site had been called Okabena during the grading of the railway in 1871 for the two adjoining lakes, meaning the nesting place of herons, a Dakota name from hokah, "heron," be, "nests," and na, a diminutive suffix, as noted by Prof. A. W. Williamson. Its railroad station was named Okabena, as was the post office for the first year of operation, 1872, with Herbert W. Kimball as first postmaster. In the autumn of 1871 that name was changed to Worthington in honor of the mother of Mary Dorman Miller, wife of Dr. A. P. Miller, who was intimately associated with Ransom F. Humiston in forming the National Colony Company and founding Worthington, before noticed because Ransom Township was named for him. Mrs. Miller in 1888 wrote of the origin of this name: "My mother's maiden name was Worthington. Her father was Robert Worthington, of Chillicothe, Ohio, who was the brother of Thomas Worthington, governor of Ohio; and the now beautiful, prosperous town of Worthington, Minn., was named for the Chillicothe family." Worthington Township was organized May 20, 1872.</p><p>Okabena Creek, flowing east from Worthington to Heron Lake in Jackson County, is the outlet of the West Okabena Lake, whence the site of Worthington was at first named Okabena, as before noted. From this name, given to Heron Lake on Nicollet's map in 1843, the present name of that lake was translated, while the Dakota name, referring to these lakes and the creek as "the nesting place of herons," was retained for the creek and for two lakes at Worthington, of which the east one has been drained.</p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

His later map of the pipestone quarry names this cascade as Winnewissa Falls (Aborigines of Minn., 1911, plate at p. 564), from the Dakota verb winawizi, "to be jealous or envious." The name had been used much earlier in an excellent poem by Adelaide George Bennett of Pipestone, titled "The Peace-Pipe Quarry," first read at a celebration there July 4, 1878, which was reprinted as pp. 77-85 in Indian Legends of Minnesota, compiled by Cordenio A. Severance and published in 1893. In the reprint Mrs. Bennett inserted new lines with this name, "Falls of Winnewissa."<p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Lake Minnewaska</strong> is in Pope County <br>MINNEWASKA Township, adjoining the northern shore of the largest lake in this county, bears the name given to the lake by the white settlers made from two Dakota words, mini or minne, "water," and washta or waska, "good." Prof. N. H. Winchell wrote of the lake and its successive names, as follows: "This lake, according to statements of citizens of Glenwood, was originally designated by an Indian name, meaning Dish Lake, because of its being in a low basin. After that, when the chief, White Bear, was buried in a high hill on the north shore, it was called White Bear Lake. After a time it was changed to Lake Whipple, from Bishop Whipple, of Faribault, and by act of the state legislature in 1883 it was again changed to Minnewaska, or Good-water. It is said to be 85 feet deep in its deepest part and averages about 40 feet, and there is no known evidence of its having ever stood at a higher level" (Geological Survey of Minnesota, Thirteenth Annual Report, for 1884, p. 14).<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Carver's Cave</strong> is in Ramsey County <br>This county, established February 20, 1855, was named for Capt. Jonathan Carver, explorer and author, who was born in Wyemouth, Massachusetts, on April 13, 1710, and died in London, England, January 31, 1780. He commanded a company in the French war, and in 1763, when the treaty of peace was declared, he resolved to explore the newly acquired possessions of Great Britain in the Northwest. In 1766 he traveled from Boston to the upper Mississippi River and spent the ensuing winter with the Dakota on the Minnesota River in the vicinity of the site of New Ulm. On his return, according to statements published after his death, he negotiated a treaty, May 1, 1767, at Carver's Cave, in the east edge of the present city of St. Paul, by which the Dakota granted to him a large tract of land on the east side of the Mississippi. Carver continued his explorations by a canoe journey along the north and east shore of Lake Superior. He returned to Boston in October 1768, soon sailed to England, and spent the remainder of his life in London.<p>Carver's Cave is located in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/ventosanctuary.htm">Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary</a></p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>White Bear Lake</strong> is in Ramsey County <br>William H. C. Folsom, in his Fifty Years in the Northwest (1888, on its p. 545), wrote of the Dakota name as follows: "The Indians called this a grizzly, polar, or white bear, and named an adjacent locality [now a village on the northeastern shore, in Washington County] 'Mah-to-me-di,' or 'M'de, i. e., Mahto, gray polar bear, and M'de, lake. It is not probable, however, that a polar bear ever reached this spot, and a visit from a grizzly is nearly as improbable. Indian legends are very frequently made to order by those who succeed them as owners of the soil."<p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Redwood Falls</strong>  is in Ramsey County <br><p>Established February 6, 1862, this county was named for the Redwood River, whence also comes the name of the county seat, Redwood Falls, situated on a series of cascades and rapids of the river. Prof. A. W. Williamson wrote of this name: "Chanshayapi;--chan, wood; sha, red; ayapi, are on; Redwood river; so called by the Dakotas on account of the abundance of a straight slender bush with red bark, which they scraped off and smoked, usually mixed with tobacco. This name is spelled by Nicollet Tchanshayapi." William H. Keating and George W. Featherstonhaugh each gave both the Dakota and English names of this river; and the latter traveler expressly defined their meaning, as follows: "This red wood is a particular sort of willow, with an under bark of a reddish colour, which the Indians dry and smoke. When mixed with tobacco it makes what they call Kinnee Kinnik, and is much less offensive than common tobacco."</p><p>The inner bark of two Cornus species, C. sericea, the silky cornell, and C. stolonifera, the red-osier dogwood, were used by the Indians, both the Dakota and the Ojibwe, to mix with their tobacco for smoking. The Algonquian word kinnikinnick for such addition to the tobacco included also the leaves of the bearberry and leaves of sumac, gathered when they turn red in the autumn, which were similarly used.</p><p>It has been supposed also that the Dakota name of the Redwood River alludes to the red cedar trees on its bluffs at Redwood Falls or to trees there marked by spots of red paint for guidance of a war party at some time during the ancient warfare between the Ojibwe and the Dakota for ownership of this region, as told in a Dakota legend to early white settlers (history of this county, 1916, pp. 613-14). Either of these alternative suggestions has seemed to many of the settlers more probable than the testimony for the kinnikinnick, which was received from an earlier and more intimate knowledge of the Dakota people and their language. Chan, as a Dakota word, may mean "a tree or any woody shrub," being a more general word than wood in our language, which in its most common use is applied only to trees.</p><p>But two or even all three of these reasons for the naming of the river may be included together as each contributing to its origin, namely, the kinnikinnick, the red cedars, and also painted trees. In support of the third as a part of the origin, we should quote from Giacomo C. Beltrami who was here in 1823, accompanying Maj. Stephen H. Long's expedition, for he wrote that the Redwood River was "so called from a tree which the savages paint red every year and for which they have a peculiar veneration" (Beltrami, A Pilgrimage in America, vol. 2, p. 316)</p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

Nicollet's map in 1843. This village was the first county seat, until a very long contest, begun in 1885, was finally decided in October 1900 by removal of the county offices to Olivia. An act to invalidate the incorporation was approved on April 14, 1891. The village was platted on land owned by David Carrothers and Sam McPhail, the latter residing in Redwood Falls; a post office operated 1867-1904.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Sacred Heart</strong> is in Renville County <br>SACRED HEART Township, organized April 6, 1869, was settled mostly by Lutherans, so that the adoption of a name apparently Roman Catholic in origin seems surprising. It was derived, however, from the name given by the Dakota to an early trader, Charles Patterson, who about 1783 established a trading post at the rapids of the Minnesota River in the present section 29, Flora, later called Patterson's Rapids. He wore a bearskin hat, whence, "the bear being a sacred animal to the Indians, they called him the 'Sacred Hat' man, which gradually became Sacred Heart" (History of the Minnesota Valley, p. 817). The name so applied to the trader was afterward used by the Dakota for the site of his trading post and thence it was given, in this accepted translation, to the adjacent township.<p> From: Upham, Warren.

Its name and also that of the Rock River refer to the prominent rock outcrop (called "The Rock" on Joseph N. Nicollet's map in 1843) of reddish gray quartzite, forming a plateau of gradual ascent from the west and north, but terminated precipitously on the east and south, which occupies an area of three or four square miles, situated about three miles north of Luverne, on the west side of the Rock River, above which it has a height of about 175 feet. In this generally prairie region, "the Mound," as this plateau is now called, commands an extensive prospect. The name is translated from the Dakota "Inyan Reakah or River of the Rock," as it was mapped by Nicollet.<p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

The present name was adopted at the annual town meeting, April 5, 1859, being taken from the stream that flows through this township and supplies water power at Jordan. It was mapped by Nicollet as "Batture aux fieves," meaning "shallow, with fevers." Next on the map of Minnesota dated January 1, 1860, it is called Fever River and also has a Dakota name, Chankiyata River, of undetermined meaning, while a settlement near the site of Jordan is named Sand Creek. Numerous outcrops of soft white sandstone occur there, whence the stream and township were named.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Shakopee</strong> is in Scott County <br><p>SHAKOPEE, a city in Jackson and Eagle Creek Townships, the county seat, was founded by Thomas A. Holmes in 1851 as a trading post, to which he gave this name of the leader of a Dakota band living here. The village, platted in 1854, was incorporated as a city May 23, 1857, but surrendered its charter in 1861, returning to township government. It was incorporated as a village on March 1, 1866. It again received a city charter March 3, 1870, and the former township of Shakopee, excepting the city area, was renamed Jackson, as before noted, January 17, 1871. Holmes, born in Pennsylvania in 1804, is considered the "father" of Shakopee; he served in the 1849 territorial legislature and was influential in the community; he moved to Cullman, Ala., in 1878, where he died in 1888. The post office began in 1853 and was spelled Shah-k'pay until changed to the present spelling in 1857; Holmes was the first postmaster. The village had a station of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railroads.</p><p>Shakopee (or Shakpay, as it was commonly pronounced), meaning Six, was the hereditary name, like Wabasha, of successive leaders, in lineal descent from father to son. The first of whom we have definite knowledge is the Shakopee who was killed when running the gauntlet at Fort Snelling in June 1827, as related by Charlotte O. Van Cleve (Three Score Years and Ten, 1888, pp. 74-79). The second, who is commemorated by the name of this city, characterized by Samuel W. Pond, Jr., as "a man of marked ability in council and one of the ablest and most effective orators in the whole Dakota Nation," died in 1860. His son, who had been called Shakpedan (Little Six), born on the site of the city in 1811, became at his father's death the leader of the band, numbering at that time about 400. He was hanged at Fort Snelling, November 11, 1865, for his actions in the Dakota War of 1862.</p> <a href="http://www.beginningdakota.org/audio/24_13.mp3" target="_blank">Hear</a> Shakopee pronounced in Dakota. <p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Wabasha</strong> County and City <br><p>This county, established October 27, 1849, commemorates a line of Dakota leaders, whose history is told by Hon. Charles C. Willson in the MHS Collections (vol. 12: 503-12 [1908]). Wapashaw (variously spelled) was the name, in three successive generations, of the hereditary leaders having greatest influence among the Mississippi bands of the Dakota. Thomas L. McKenney and James Hall, in the first volume of their History of the Indian Tribes of North America (1836), gave a portrait of the second man bearing this name, who wore a covering over his left eye. The third Wapashaw's band occupied the country below Lake Pepin, his principal village being on the Rollingstone Creek, near the site of Minnesota City. A beautiful prairie in the Mississippi valley three to five miles southeast of this village, commonly called Wapashaw's Prairie 60 to 80 years ago, became the site of the city of Winona.</p><p>The town (now a city) of Wabasha, which was named in 1843 for the last of these three leaders, is situated at a distance of 30 miles up the Mississippi from his village. It was at first called Cratte's Landing, for the earliest white man to build his home there, in 1838.</p><p>From this town the county containing it, which was later established, received its name. The more remote origin of the name, which means "red leaf," and thence "red hat or cap," and "red battle-standard," as applied to the first man named Wapashaw, was on the occasion of his return, as tradition relates, from a visit to Quebec, at some time after the cession of Canada to Great Britain in 1763. He had received from the English governor presents of a soldier's uniform, with its red cap, and an English flag, which, being displayed triumphantly on his arrival among his own people, led to their hailing him as Wapashaw (History of Winona County, 1883, p. 31).</p><p>This name is widely different, as to its origin and meaning, from the Wabash River, which is said to signify in its original Algonquian, "a cloud blown forward by an equinoctial wind." In pronunciation, Wabasha should have the vowel of its accented first syllable (formerly spelled Waa and Wah) sounded like the familiar word ah; and its final a, like awe. There is, however, a tendency or a prevalence of usage departing from the aboriginal pronunciation for each of the four names of Wabasha, Wadena, Waseca, and Watonwan, by giving to the first a its broad sound as in awe or fall.</p><p> <a href="http://www.beginningdakota.org/audio/24_21.mp3" target="_blank">Hear</a> it pronounced in Dakota. </p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Waseca</strong> is in Waseca County <br><p>This county was established February 27, 1857. Its name is a Dakota word, which has been explained by Prof. A. W. Williamson as follows: "Waseca (wasecha),--rich, especially in provisions. I was informed in 1855 by a gentleman who was a stranger to me, who professed to be one of the first settlers, that this name was given in response to inquiries as to the Indian word for fertile, and adopted as a name. In Dakota writing and books the word waseca is spelled as we spell the name, and is a word likely to be given in answer to such a question. The soil is also very fertile." The name was first applied to the earliest farming settlement in 1855, near the present city of this name.</p><p>The dictionary of the Dakota language, by Rev. S. R. Riggs, published in 1852, shows that this word was pronounced as if written washecha. It has the same accent and vowel sounds as Wadena.</p><p> From: Upham, Warren.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Watonwan</strong> is in Watonwan County <br>This county, established February 25, 1860, was named from the Watonwan River, whose headstreams flow through it. Prof. A. W. Williamson, in his paper on our Dakota geographic names, wrote: "This word might mean 'I see,' or 'he sees,' intransitive; it may have been applied to this branch of the Blue Earth as being a prairie country and presenting a good prospect, but it is uncertain whether this is the meaning on which the appellation was given." Rev. M. N. Adams later stated the significance of this name without doubt, that in being anglicized it was misspelled, and that it should be Watanwan, meaning "fish bait," or "where fish bait abounds," as he had been informed by the Dakota. Our earliest knowledge of the Watonwan River is supplied by Joseph N. Nicollet's report and map, published in 1843. Its accent is on the first syllable; and the first a has its sound as in father, the last as in fall.<p> From: Upham, Warren. Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia.

<b>Description:</b> <strong>Winona</strong> is in Winona County <br>Established February 23, 1854, this county was named for a Dakota woman, Winona, cousin of the last chief named Wabasha, both of whom were prominent in the events attending the removal in 1848 of the Winnebago Indians from Iowa to Wabasha&#39;s Prairie (the site of the city of Winona) and thence to Long Prairie in Todd County. This name belonged, said Prof. A. W. Williamson, in any Dakota family, to the &quot;first born, if a daughter, diminutive of wino, woman&quot;; and similarly the name of the &quot;first born child, if a son,&quot; was Chaska. In pronunciation, Winona is accented on the middle syllable, and the first and last syllables have the short vowel sounds. The first, however, is often incorrectly given the long sound, as in <i>wine;</i> it should be short, as in <i>win</i>, or may be quite rightly given the sound of long <i>e</i>, as <i>we.</i>  <a href="http://www.beginningdakota.org/audio/24_6.mp3" target="_blank">Hear</a> it pronounced in Dakota. <p> From: Upham, Warren.
