In the UK we are developing a SIB pilot to prevent HIV/AIDS in Southwark Lambeth and Lewisham - areas with particularly high prevalence of HIV - rather than the 12 cases per 100000 (England) it is around 60 in these three London boroughs. This is due to the high proportion of the population that is African origin and men who have sex with men the two most at risk groups. This project will be the first SIB in the world on HIV and will save lives and money to the health system � namely by avoiding future HIV infections (the lifetime cost of treatment a single person is �360800 in the UK).<br>

<b>Description:</b> TheGivingMachine (TGM) has created a service enabling a small change in user/shopper behaviour to generate funds for good causes that cost the shopper nothing. It allows everyone to become a donor. Users shop online via over 2000 retailers and generate sales commissions that users can allocate to their causes. Users can support up to four organisations – more than any other site of this kind – including charities schools and local community groups. Almost 100000 users have joined to date. Causes can join for free and promote the service to their supporters – over 7000 causes are directly benefiting. Over £30m has been referred through the site creating over £1.2m in donations – many of which are schools and small local community groups that have less access to fundraising. 2016 turnover is forecast as c.£300k. Sales commissions are split between causes and TGM with TGM effectively retaining 25-45% depending on Gift Aid being applied.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Criminal justice in the UK is at a critical juncture with increases to the number of self-representing litigants impacting on the standard and quality of judgments made in court. The government is not actively assessing the problem and there is a risk of increasing injustice. Commons will be the first not for profit cooperative law firm offering services primarily funded by legal aid payments to help the vulnerable in the system. Commons will also instigate and support projects to increase opportunities for disadvantaged target groups. No other law firm in London is set up in this way or has these explicit goals. Motivated by a desire to see criminal defence advice and representation delivered with an informed and compassionate focus on the needs of clients Commons has been set up by lawyers Rhona Friedman Sashy Nathan and Ben Stuttard. It is intended that the work of Commons not only provides immediate improvement by offering its service to vulnerable clients in London but can have a wider impact by modelling an alternative way of doing law and sharing learning and experiences with the legal and advice communities more widely.<br>
