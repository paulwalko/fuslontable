The cops refused to hear any  of my pleas, specifically that the bike lane wasn't present when I entered 2nd Ave. The ticket was for approximately $130. I went to court to fight it with the law highlighted where it says, "--34 RCNY 4-12(p)(1) states that bicyclists should ride in usable bike lanes, unless they are preparing to turn, or are avoiding unsafe conditions (including but not limited to, fixed or moving objects, motor vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, pushcarts, animals, surface hazards)." I went to court with maps, the law, and more, and I didn't have to say a word because while the law is on the state books, the judge immediately said, "This law is not applicable in the city. Case dismissed."<br>

<b>Story::</b> NYCC is the largest recreational bike club in the city and we believe the largest all-volunteer such club in the country. A good number of our members have received tickets for running red lights in Central Park since the blitz began in January.        Recently one of our members was ticketed for not signaling a right turn on Riverside Drive, though the light was green. More recently, Park ticketing has seemed to be more sensibly targeted at obviously reckless cyclist behavior, in particular those cyclists not yielding to pedestrians at crosswalks.-Ellen Jaffe, President, New York Cycle Club<br>

<b>Story::</b> I got a ticket at Broadway and Greene ave in Brooklyn, NY. Broadway in Brooklyn is HORRIBLE for bicycles. I learned the hard way after moving to the area newly and not realizing it is to be avoided AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.There's potholes galore. Had to repeatedly hop into the side walk to avoid being nailed whilst dodging potholes one one particular night around 1:00am. Of course, an on duty officer stopped me, gave me a hard time and ticketed me. Afterwords, he said "be safe". I found his advice to stay off the sidewalk at 1:00am, and to "be safe" were a perfectly contradictory when applied to Broadway and Greene Ave in Brooklyn.                However, the case was thrown out. Charges dropped. I'm a free man!<br>

<b>Full Name:</b> Richard Vaudrey<br>
<b>Location:</b> Buschwich, NY<br>
<b>Story::</b> This weekend my fiancee and I decided to explore a new area of Brooklyn (Bushwick) on our bicycles. As we neared a busy street we pulled off the side street onto the sidewalk at less than walking pace, where immediately we were pulled over by some police on foot.  We are both Australian students and thought the police were approaching us for a friendly chat - suggesting we stayed on the road.  A few mintues later we were being issued a court summons, no fine, or indication of how much, but a mandatory appearance in court! Clearly a rational assessment of the situation would be that these educated well to do students were simply playing it safe, pottering around doing no harm, but no - we were told we could be robbers as we were riding on the sidewalk - really????? We were pleasant and friendly to these police, suggesting that perhaps it would be less of a waste of tax payers money to simply advise us to stay on the road - which we were more than happy to do.  It seems absurd that the state gets broker as two pleasant australians pumping money into your economy by studying in the US have to go and waste state funds on a judge to assess whether these two innocent people were endangering the public.  I used to be impressed that in NY there is a cop on every corner - now I have a different opinion! And in a county of litigation, where were the no bikes on side walk signs' - there are bikes parked everywhere on sidewalks, they have to get there somehow! I completely understand if you're tearing at speed down a sidewalk that this would be an offense - but less than walking pace... clearly as you pull off a street coming to a stop.. insane.  If a fine was issued, i'd understanding 'revenue raising'. But to lose the state money by sending us to court where it will most likely be thrown out due to its absurdity of rationality.  Something needs to happen - cycling should be encouraged! A man on a bicycle should not feel he has to look over his shoulder every second in case of getting a day of his life wasted to satisfy a rookie cops quota. .<br>

<b>Story::</b> Coffey Street between Ferris St. and Conover St. in Red Hook. I was ticketed for riding on the sidewalk which I normally would not even consider but the streets in that neighborhood are cobble stones and too rough for a small folding bicycle. While the officers wrote my ticket a person from the block came up and expressed his shock that I was being ticketed because as he put it "cycling on the sidewalk is an accepted practice on the block because the street is cobble stone".  The officers shared that the mayor is under fire resulting from the bike lanes and as a consequence there's a push to balance that with stepped up enforcement of traffic regulations against cyclists.<br>

Recently the area of "enforcement" has expanded out in general. People are being ticketed for not riding in the bike lane (even when they are turning, or the bike lane is obstructed), not signaling (which I have never seen enforced on an automobile), and there recently was even a petite young female bike rider who was arrested by a reported 10 police officers, after a testy word to an unbadged, plain clothes officer in an unmarked car on Amsterdam Avenuehad cut her off. The really messed up thing about a great many of these tickets is the fact that they are incorrect applications of the law. Focused squarely at those who pose little risk to pedestrians.<br>

<b>Story::</b> I was ticketed last March in Times Square for riding a bike without a helmert. I went to the local precinct with a 2010 bike map, produced by NYC Parks and Recreation, which clearly states that wearing a helmet is not required by anyone over 13-years old.  The police destroyed my ticket as well as the corresponding computer entry of the ticket.<br>

<b>Story::</b> On the UWS - Broadway in the mid 80s, I got a ticket for going through a red light. I always pause at a red light.  If there is traffic crossing I stop fully. But  if there's no one crossing, I go through.  Got a ticket for $190 mid March. The cop said they are cracking down on bikers. When I told him, I once nearly got run over by a cop car speeding through a red light (no sirens or flashing lights), he thought they probably had good reason.<br>
