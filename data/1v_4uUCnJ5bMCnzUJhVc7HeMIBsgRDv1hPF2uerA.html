<b>Description:</b> S.R. Plumbing was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy but they are now open for business! They are located in the Rockaways on Beach 116th Street, literally feet from the ocean, and needless to say, they were flooded badly. They now have a large inventory available, some of which was hung high enough to avoid flood waters. Many of the items in our registry can be bought from S.L.Plumbing.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Brown’s Hardware is on Beach 116th Street just a stone’s throw away from the ocean. They were flooded badly and lost a great deal of valuable inventory and expensive machinery. They are struggling to rebuild, but as of this week their store is open for business. Many of the items listed can be purchased at Brown’s Hardware, whether they are tagged for them or not. Let’s get them up and running! <br>

<b>Description:</b> In 1952, Meyer and Morton Garber founded Garber Building Supplies, since then they have been the one and only family run lumber yard for a large portion of Staten Island. This is the location where Occupy Sandy and the congregation from Saint Margaret and Saint Mary’s will be sourcing all of our lumber, sheet-rock, doors and windows for the sustained rebuilding effort in Staten Island. Thank you from the Garber Family. Stuart, Bob &amp; Larry Garber<br>

<b>Description:</b> Much more than just plumbing supplies, for over 40 years and three generations, the Saccheri family has served the professional hardware and plumbing supply needs for Midland Beach and the surrounding area of Staten Island. During Sandy the neighborhood Hylan Plumbing calls home took up to 6 feet of water. Uniquely situated in one of the areas hit hardest, Hylan Plumbing has been a crucial epicenter for the community rebuilding of Midland Beach and beyond. They are a great family that deserves our support! Inventory soon to come, but items not tagged for another store can most possibly be bought at Hylan. With big box competitors driving most other hardware stores out of business, let’s give Hylan the credit they deserve! Support local, recovering, family-run businesses like this.<br>
