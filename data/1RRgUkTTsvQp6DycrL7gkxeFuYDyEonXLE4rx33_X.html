<b>Title:</b> Abercrombie House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Aaron L. Lundquist<br>
Common Name: Colonel William Abercrombie House<br>
<br>
Built on Spokane's South Hill, the Abercrombie House is significant for its association with the early military history of Spokane.  Arriving in Spokane in the summer of 1877, Colonel William R. Abercrombie was the first U.S. military leader brought to Spokane to make way for American expansion.  After receiving assignments to various military outposts Colonel William R. Abercrombie and his wife, Lillian Kimball Abercrombie, made the home their first permanent Spokane residence and lived in it from 1908 until their deaths.  Colonel Abercrombie was an active leader in the Indian wars and was named commander of Fort George Wright in 1910.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Ackermann House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Earl Wilson Morrison<br>
Common Name: O. M. Lilliequist House<br>
<br>
The Ackermann House was completed in early 1912 and is an outstanding authentic example of Prairie School architecture by a young designer who, at the time, was an architectural student in Chicago.  Horizontal lines, established by the layered hipped roofs, dominate the exterior and the pervasive use of stucco gives a monolithic, sculptural look to the house.  The home was one of the earliest, most expensive and prestigious houses surrounding the southern focus of Rockwood Boulevard.  Originally built as a speculative, high-end residential investment by Olof Malmberg Lilliequist, the home was purchased by David Ackermann, a local banker, and his wife, Edith, shortly after its completion.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Albert Apartments<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1903<br>
Architect: Charles R. Wood<br>
Common Name: Kensington Court<br>
<br>
The Albert Apartments is an excellent example of early 20th-century apartment house construction and is one of only two remaining apartment buildings of the 15 apartment buildings that were once located in Saunder's Addition in east central Spokane during the early 1900s. The facade design of the Albert Apartments is a fine example of the Colonial Revival style while the interior of the building--remodeled in 1931 by noted Spokane architect Charles R. Wood--reveals Craftsman-style influence. The Albert Apartments was named after Albert Commellini, one of Spokane's most colorful businessmen and noted leaders of the city's Italian community. The building is architecturally as well as historically significant for its association with the development of early Spokane and for its role as one of the best remaining representations of the life of Albert Commellini.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Albi House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1913<br>
Architect: Walter L. Weld<br>
Common Name: Joseph &amp; Mazie Albi House<br>
<br>
The Joseph Albi House is a fine example of a Craftsman style bungalow. Built by Spokane contractor Walter L. Weld as a "spec" home, the property was given to Joseph Albi and his wife Mazie as a wedding gift from Albi's parents. During the 43 years that Joseph Albi lived in the house, he became one of Spokane's most well-known and influential leaders. He was a successful attorney and businessman, philanthropist and civic benefactor, and an indomitable fund-raiser and sports-supporter. Implementing his ideas for the promotion of sports in Spokane, Albi helped found the Spokane Athletic Round Table and served as its president for 42 years. Backed by the organization, Albi spearheaded the fundraising, construction, and creation of the Esmeralda Golf Course and Clubhouse, and the Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane--public facilities that continue to be enjoyed by thousands of people in the Spokane community year after year. In addition, Albi was appointed to act as the Italian Consulate for Idaho and Eastern Washington from 1929 to 1941. A Spokesman-Review article on May 9, 1962 summed up Joe Albi's contributions to Spokane saying: He did more for Spokane and the Inland Empire sports world than any other man, ever.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Alger-Bristol Hotel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1904<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Alger-Bristol Hotel<br>
<br>
The Alger-Bristol Hotel is a typical example of the property type "single room occupancy hotel." The three-story building is a rectangular box constructed of eighteen-inch-thick unreinforced brick masonry walls. It has a flat roof of built-up tar, a metal-capped brick parapet wall, and a basalt rock foundation. Symmetrically balanced exterior fenestration patterns located above street-level, a central light well, interior room configurations, and a separate door that opens to upper-story hotel rooms from the street embody features of the property type and convey the building's original use as an SRO.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Alvis House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1913<br>
Builders: Franklin Manz, John Thomas and M. Endres
Common Name: Harry and Dorothy Alvis House<br>
<br>
The Alvis House is a fine example of the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition with influences from the Craftsman, Prairie, and Swiss Chalet styles. It was erected as a &quot;spec&quot; house by a group of investors and builders who sold it one year after construction to Harry Alvis, an automobile salesman in Spokane, and his wife, Dorothy. LeRoy &amp; Beta Beeson, owners/proprietors of Beeson Brothers automobile sales/service in Spokane, resided in the house for 13 years, and Marion &amp; Robert Root, a Pacific Mutual Life Insurance agent and agency owner, lived at the property for 58 years. During its period of significance from 1913 to 1956, the Alvis House achieved importance in the areas of architecture and community planning &amp; development. The property is architecturally significant as a fine depiction of the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition and as a product of Spokane architect, Franklin Manz, and for its association with trends and patterns which led to the urban development and subsequent settlement of the Cannon Hill Park Addition on Spokane&#39;s South Hill.<br>

<b>Title:</b> American Firebrick Company<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1902<br>
Architect: Charles P. Oudin (founder)<br>
Common Name: Interpace Corporation Mica Brickyard<br>
<br>
Responding to the building boom and need for brick throughout the Spokane area after the devastating fire of 1889, brickyards were established in a number of locations.  However, most of these yards did not last for more than a decade and the American Firebrick Company brickyard at Mica is the only remaining yard from the time.  Much of the brick used in the buildings of Spokane, both now and in the past, was fired in the kilns at Mica.  The brickyard was also responsible for the development of the Mica community and continues to function as a key economic contributor in the area.  The beehive kilns are among the few remaining in the country that date back to the turn of the century.  The unique architectural design of these kilns provides a rare glimpse of early industrial technology.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Legion Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1901<br>
Architect: John K. Dow<br>
Common Name: Metals Building<br>
<br>
Located in Spokane's central business district, the Legion Building is a fine example of the commercial Renaissance Revival style. The five-story masonry block was built by businessman, mining tycoon and yachtsman, F. Lewis Clark, to house the Spokane Club.  The building itself is a manifestation of the wealth generated in this area at the turn of the century.  Clark's intent in hiring John K. Dow as architect was to build and furnish one of the finest club quarters on the west coast.  Clad in Minnesota sandstone, blonde pressed brick veneer, creme-colored terra cotta embellishment and possessing a unique inset loggia with Corinthian capitals, Clark's vision certainly came true. Unfortunately for Spokane, Mr. Clark mysteriously disappeared in Santa Barbara on the night of January 16th, 1914.  Only his hat was found in the surf the following day.<br>

While the Ammann is not as elaborate as the other apartment buildings designed by architect Albert Held (Breslin, Knickerbocker, San Marco), it was one of the first and is clearly representative of the architect's style. Held's apartment buildings are listed on the National Register collectively in a multiple property nomination. Handsome in its simplicity, the Amman is located along historic Riverside Avenue, one of the first areas where apartments were built in Spokane.

<b>Title:</b> Anderson-Webster House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Ballard Plannary Company<br>
Common Name: Anderson-Webster House<br>
<br>
The Anderson-Webster House &amp; Garage together reflect one of the finest and best-preserved examples of the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition rendered in the Craftsman style on Spokane&#39;s South Hill. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as a contributing resource of the Marycliff-Cliff Park National Register Historic District. The home&#39;s Craftsman style features widely overhanging eaves, exposed scroll-sawn rafter tails, and robust use of false half-timbering with coarse-grained stucco infill, heavily textured cobbled clinker brick, and black basalt rock. The Anderson-Webster House achieved importance as an especially excellent example of the Craftsman style, as a product of the Ballard Plannary Company, as the home of Judge J. Stanley Webster, and for its association with the trends and patterns of urban residential development that led to the subsequent settlement of the Cliff Park neighborhood in the Marycliff-Cliff Park National Register Historic District.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Andreasen House<br>

Common Name: Ove &amp; Mary Andreasen House<br>
<br>
Listed in 1997 as a contributing property in the Rockwood National Register Historic District, the Ove &amp; Mary Andreasen House is an exemplary rendition of the Colonial Revival style with Georgian influence. The home was built on speculation in 1927 by Spokane contractor, Edward Hokanson, and was later purchased by Ove Andreasen, an investment entrepreneur, and his wife, Mary Hughes Andreasen, who together spent more than $10,000 on the property. Defining features of the Colonial Revival style include the home&#39;s two-story form, formal massing, side gable roof, prominent cornice and cornice returns, red brick veneer cladding, recessed front entrance, curved pediment entry hood, wood-shuttered multi-paned windows, and symmetrical design with symmetrical fenestration patterns. With remarkably few modifications, the Andreasen House is well-preserved with excellent exterior and interior architectural integrity in original location, design, materials, workmanship, and association as a single-family residence built in the early 1920s in Spokane, Washington.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Armstrong House<br>

Architect: Albert Held<br>
Common Name: Major James Melville Armstrong House
Located within the National Register Ninth Avenue Historic District, the majestic Armstrong House serves as a welcoming gateway to the area, and stands on the street for which the district is named. With its massive, prominent portico rising the full two-and-one-half stories of the house and supported by marble-white Ionic columns, the Armstrong House at 1022 West Ninth Avenue represents one of the best-preserved and finest examples of Neoclassical style architecture rarely found in Spokane. Built in 1910 for Lida B. and Major James Melville Armstrong, a Civil War veteran who lost his leg in the battle of Atlanta and an early Spokane entrepreneur, the house glistens a classic pristine-white against its red roof, red brick foundation, and the deep green trees and shrubs that envelope it. The 6000-square foot house sits squarely on three, large, tree-lined lots, and boasts a circular drive, a porte-cochere, and a 1910 outbuilding that once served as a carriage house.<br>

<br>
Avondale Court was built in several stages in a residential/commercial sector of Spokane's central business distric starting in1905, and is historically significant for its association with the dramatic growth that Spokane experienced during the first decade of the 20th century. Unfortunately for the owners, a mill workers' strike in 1903 delayed construction and it took another two years to complete. Meanwhile, demand for housing in Spokane skyrocketed, as population swelled from 36,848 to 104,402 between 1900 and 1910. The Spokesman-Review reported on December 19, 1903: "Spokane leads the nation in percentage of residential building construction."<br>

<b>Title:</b> Balkan Hotel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1909<br>
Architect: C. E. Wentzel<br>
Common Name: Balkan Hotel<br>
<br>
The Balkan Hotel is historically significant as a Single Room Occupancy Hotel, a particularly popular type of housing during the economic boom that fueled Spokane's explosive population growth in the first decade of the century. Single Room Occupancy Hotels like the Balkan, built in 1909, provided working class housing for the large numbers of itinerant laborers that flocked to Spokane to take advantage of expanding opportunities associated with the city's emergence as a regional transportation hub. The east downtown neighborhood where this SRO was located became an enclave for immigrants arriving in Spokane from the Balkan Peninsula, as the hotel's name suggests. Together with the Balkan Serbian Benevolent Society, located two blocks west, the Balkan Hotel served as a focal point for the neighborhood's Balkan immigrant community.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Barnett House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1903<br>
Architect: Arthur E. Saunders<br>
Common Name: Alonzo &amp; Louise Barnett House<br>
<br>
The Alonzo and Louise Barnett House is an excellent example of the Free Classic Queen Anne style and is the only dwelling in the Mountain View Addition that features a combination of brick and frame construction, a round turret, and a wrap-around porch. In addition, the Barnett House is remarkably intact, conveying building techniques, materials and designs popularized by the Queen Anne style better than most homes in the neighborhood. Designed by Spokane architect Arthur E. Saunders, the house was featured in a Spokesman-Review newspaper article dated October 29, 1905 that explained the home's state-of-the-art design, lauding it as modern American architecture built of buff pressed brick with two-inch air spaces in the walls. The house was built for Louise and Alonzo Barnett, owners of the Spokane-based A. A. Barnett Company, a business that specialized in loans and real estate investments. The Barnetts lived there from 1903 to 1922.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Battle of Four Lakes Monument<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1935<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Battle of Four Lakes Monument<br>
<br>
The Battle of Four Lakes Monument was erected in 1935 by Spokane County Pioneer Society, Medical Lake Commercial Club and Four Lakes Grange.  The unassuming granite pyramid commemorates the 1858 battle between a confederation of Plateau Indian Tribes and a force commanded by Colonel George Wright.  Wright was sent by General Newman Clarke to wage a punitive campaign in retaliation for the Tribe's attack on Lieutenant Colonel Edward Steptoe's forces earlier in the year.  Armed with the latest automatic rifles, Wright's soldiers routed the native forces.  Although the monument reads that 700 Army soldiers defeated "5000 allied Indians," contemporary research indicates that both sides were evenly matched, as Wright's fighting forces numbered around 500 and the Indian forces only slightly more than that.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Battle of Spokane Plains Monument<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1935<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Battle of Spokane Plains State Park Monument<br>
<br>
Composed of basaltic rock, the large pyramid sits on what is now the Battle of Spokane Plains State Park and offers impressive views of the surrounding flat lands.  The Battle of Spokane Plains, known to the Spokane Tribe as the "Big Fight," was the culmination of a punitive expedition led by Colonel George Wright in the summer of 1858 in retribution for a skirmish that erupted when a party composed of Spokanes, Couer d'Alenes, Yakimas, Palouses and other tribes refused passage to a military expedition under Colonel E. J. Steptoe.  After engaging and defeating the combined Indian forces in a running battle at Four Lakes, Wright's troops fought them again at Spokane Plains on September 5.  After another victory, Wright wreaked havoc along the Spokane River in an effort to destroy the tribe's war-making capability.  He burned food stores and lodges before gathering up and slaughtering a herd of approximately 600 Indian horses.  After dictating the terms of peace, Wright summarily hanged Indians that he determined had committed depredations against whites, including Qualchan, the son of upper Yakima chief Owhi.  On the last day of September, Wright declared: "The war is closed."  The plaque reads: "Commemorative of the Battle of Spokane Plains, fought on September 5, 1858."  A second plate on the monument further reads: "The Battle of Spokane Plains was fought near this spot on September 5, 1858, in which the U.S. Troops under command of Col. George Wright defeated the allied Coeur d'Alene, Palouse, and Spokane Indians."<br>

<b>Title:</b> Bear Frame &amp; Axle Garage<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1930<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Bear Frame &amp; Axle Garage<br>
<br>
The Bear Frame &amp; Axle Garage has been a public service automobile garage since its construction in 1930 and is listed as a contributing structure in the National Register East Downtown Spokane Historic Business District. The structure is an excellent example of the industrial garage building type that evolved due to local, state, and national transportation trends that spurred the construction of hundreds of thousands of similar garages across the country. With original Art Deco-style detailing seen notably on the building&#39;s facade in pyramidal parapet corner projections and pilaster chevron motifs, the design of the Bear Frame &amp; Axle Garage is typical of public service garages built during the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s in Spokane, WA. Sandwiched between two multi-story, brick-masonry single room occupancy hotels that were built in the early 1900s, the Bear Frame &amp; Axle Garage reflects part of a contiguous historic building facade along West Sprague Avenue that conveys construction trends and designs, building practices, materials, and workmanship that were popular during the early decades of the 20th century in Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Bennett Block<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1890<br>
Architect: John K. Dow and Herman Preusse<br>
Common Name: The Bennett Block, Mizuna<br>
<br>
Built in 1890 and 1892, the Bennett Block is composed of three adjoined historic commercial buildings in downtown Spokane.  Visually prominent due to its busy corner site and overall mass, the property is a fine example of vernacular masonry construction that is articulated with red pressed brick, shaped parapets, stained-glass windows and decorative granite and terra cotta embellishments.  The Bennett Block was also one of the first group of buildings erected during the reconstruction of Spokane after the devastating fire of 1889.  Originally owned by Bascomb H. Bennett, a shrewd businessman, Johann G. F. Hieber began buying financial interest in the property in 1909 and owned the entire block by 1928.  After immigrating to the United States from Germany, Hieber, a certified brewmaster, built the Hieber Brewery in 1890 and continued to expand his landholdings until his death in 1941.  The well-preserved and expansive Bennett Block has remained in the Hieber family ever since.<br>

<br>
Built in 1899, the Boothe-McClintock/Electro-Kold (Joel) Building is located in Spokane&#39;s central business district. The three-story, brick masonry-and-timber frame building (plus basement) is composed of two attached structures. They include the Post Street building at 165 S. Post, and an attached warehouse at 715 West Railroad Ave on the east side dating to around 1890. The buildings were originally designed, and then extensively renovated in 1910 by Cutter &amp; Malmgren, Spokane&#39;s most celebrated architectural firm. Joel Inc., a gift store, moved into the 161 S. Post building (since burned) and remodeled the facade in the late 1960s. Joel E. Ferris Jr. was a community leader, and son of a very prominent community leader, who promoted the arts, downtown development, and philanthropy through the Joel E. Ferris Foundation. Inspired by retail stores he saw in Italy during WWII, Ferris started the gift store in 1950. Under the name of Joel Home Furnishings and Interior Design, the store expanded into Danish modern furnishings, contemporary artwork, and modernist design elements for home and office. Although the 165 S. Post structure has been altered for tenants over the years, it retains its historical integrity<br>

The Broadview Dairy was one of several commercial dairy operations established in the Spokane area around the turn of the 20th century, and it is the only local dairy business still in operation. Allen H. Flood, who first arrived in Spokane in 1889, the year of the Great Fire, founded Broadview between 1896 and 1897. Originally from Buxton, Maine, Flood helped survey Hays Park Addition and a part of what is now Hillyard, and also engaged in the lumber business before establishing his dairy. Under Flood's direction, Broadview Dairy was a leader in campaigns for dairy operations betterment; it was the first commercial dairy in the state to test for tuberculosis and get rid of infected cows, and also led the fight for pasteurization in the Inland Northwest.

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Bryant Apartments<br>
<br>
The Bryant Apartments/Broadway Pharmacy Building is historically significant for its association with the growth and development of the West Central Neighborhood, one of Spokane's oldest, and as one of the few remaining intact examples of commercial architecture in the West Broadway business district. In 1910, Stephen Morris, a motorman for W.W.P., had this building built, and then sold the property to Lydia Rogers in 1915. The property stayed with the Rogers family until 1979. This building once housed the Bryant Apartments, one of Charles Marr's grocery stores, and the Broadway Pharmacy. Charles Marr was a successful West Central businessman who owned more than seventy grocery stores at the peak of his career.<br>

Architect: Kenneth W. Brooks<br>
Common Name: Kenneth &amp; Edna Brooks House<br>
<br>
The Kenneth &amp; Edna Brooks House embodies the distinctive characteristics of the modern movement in Spokane during the 1950s. Additionally, the 1956 home represents the early work of Spokane architect Kenneth W. Brooks, who was one of the prominent trendsetters in the local architectural community for over 30 years. Through his long and distinguished career, Brooks received architectural acclaim at the local, state, and national level, and in a variety of European publications. The Brooks house is significant as a resource that demonstrates Brooks&#39; mastery of the language of architectural expression developed by Mies van der Rohe, a dominant force in American construction in the 1950s and 1960s.<br>

The Buchanan building is both architecturally and historically significant. Designed by local architects F. P. Rooney and Lewis Stritesky, the building was erected in 1911 to house James D. Buchanan's business ventures. Buchanan's mortuary, one of the finest establishments in the city, remained in the building until 1924, when it became the Hennessey and Calloway Funeral Home.

Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Buena Vista Apartments<br>
<br>
The Buena Vista Apartment buildings were constructed as the Hotel Vallamont (11 S. Cedar) and the Buena Vista Apartments (5 S. Cedar) in 1905. The area in which the structure sits was originally a residential neighborhood near the center of the small town, but as the city's population increased, there was a demand for apartment and hotel space. Several three story structures, both hotel and apartment, were erected. Some were built as luxurious quarters, but others such as these two were for more moderate incomes. This neighborhood was convenient for the expanding downtown office and shopping center and eventually boasted Linden trees on grassy islands in the middle of the wide boulevards, resulting from landscaping suggestions made by noted landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers in their Park Board report to the City of Spokane<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1890<br>
Architect: Rand and Dow (1890), Herman Preusse and Julius Zittel (1909)<br>
Common Name: Hotel Carlyle<br>
<br>
The Bump Block, located at the southwest corner of Second Avenue and Post Street, is a seven-story brick masonry structure with a basalt rubble foundation and a flat built-up roof. It exhibits characteristics of the Brick Commercial Style, distinguished as well by classically inspired elements such as the overhanging corona and modillion block of the cornice, and the round-arched windows with decorative keystones on the third floor. The building, constructed in 1890, was significantly enlarged in 1909. At that time, the original 50 foot (fronting Second Avenue) by 100 foot footprint was expanded southward along Post Street by forty feet. Also, the height of the building was raised by three stories, which entailed removal of the original roof and construction of a new cornice. These additions were designed in such a way as to replicate the original exterior appearance of the lower four floors and, through the use of similar Brick Commercial design elements on the upper floors, to create a new but cohesive structure.<br>

The California Ranch is the oldest continually occupied ranch in Spokane County, having been settled around 1864, some eight years before the arrival of the first "permanent" settlers. As the only established ranch along the Kentuck Trail between the Palouse and Spokane rivers in the 1860s, the ranch also served as an important way station and resting place for miners, packers, and early settlers passing through the region throughout the frontier period. In addition, the barn at the California Ranch exhibits remarkable architectural significance in its own right. The design, craftsmanship and materials used in this barn make it an outstanding example of early agricultural construction techniques.<br>

The Cambern Dutch Shop Windmill is a small commercial structure designed to evoke the form and character of a Dutch windmill. The shop is sited at a prominent intersection in a residential neighborhood on the south side of Spokane. Although residential in scale, the unusual form of the buildings is a striking architectural novelty in a neighborhood otherwise characterized by bungalows and cottages. The windmill is a frame structure composed of a one story, hipped roof, rectangular shop, and an octagonal tower to which is attached the four blades of the windmill. The windmill shop was a reflection of the expansion of the wholesale bakery and dairy established in Spokane in 1924 by the Cambern brothers.<br>

Common Name: George and Nellie Canfield House<br>
<br>
The George &amp; Nellie Canfield House is a fine interpretation of the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition executed in the Craftsman style. The house is distinguished from other homes of its style by the application of flared bargeboards and widely overhanging flared eaves that are embellished with unusual flared rafter tails that match the curve of the eaves. This design influence mimics rooflines of Japanese pagodas and was revered and adopted by Craftsman-style designers. The residence was erected for Spokane businessman and hydraulic engineer George S. Canfield and his wife Nellie, who maintained the property until George&#39;s death in 1921. The house is further significant as an example of the community planning and development that occurred in the early development and subsequent settlement of the Sherwood Addition in the Summit Boulevard neighborhood in northwest Spokane.<br>

The Judge &amp; Alice Canfield House is a fine representation of the Craftsman Style expressed in the American Arts &amp; Crafts tradition. The property reflects Craftsman-style details such as a side-gable roof, a full-width front porch covered by an extension of the principal roof and supported by massive porch piers and pillars, false half-timbering with stucco infill in the gable peaks, and use of natural organic building materials found in wood, stucco, brick, and indigenous black basalt rock. Gus Bostrom, an accomplished builder, built the house for Superior Court Judge Henry Ward Canfield and his wife Alice, who owned the property for more than 25 years until 1937. Historically and architecturally significant, the Judge Henry and Alice Canfield House is an example of the prescribed subdivision covenants written expressly to ensure successful and architecturally compatible residential development in the Cannon Hill Park Addition.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Carnegie Library North Monroe Branch<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1914<br>
Architect: Albert Held<br>
Common Name: Carnegie Library, North Monroe Branch<br>
<br>
The Carnegie Library, North Monroe Branch, was designed by noted Spokane architect Albert Held and built in 1914. In 1912, Andrew Carnegie promised $70,000 for construction of two permanent branches in Spokane. The Library Board and City Council disputed over where the new buildings should be located, and the compromise that emerged was that the money would be used for three branches. Of the original monetary designation, $17,500 was allocated for construction of the North Monroe Branch. The library served the local community until 1967, when the city sold the building to the local chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars. The building was then used as a meeting hall, lounge, and bingo parlor.<br>

<br>
Constructed in 1905 on Spokane's South Hill, the Carson-Clemmer-Larrabee House is both architecturally and historically significant. A highly unusual local example of the Carpenter Gothic style, the house was designed by prominent Spokane architect John K. Dow for Maida Carson, a widow. Subsequent owners included Dr. Harold Clemmer, the dentist and entrepreneur who brought Spokane the Clemmer Theater (now the Met), as well as the Larrabee family, whose members played major roles in the mining and coal industries in the Inland Northwest.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1913<br>
Architect: Loren L. Rand<br>
Common Name: Riverwalk<br>
<br>
Built in 1913, The Cascade Laundry Company, a two-story brick and concrete industrial building that lies parallel to the Spokane River, is a prominent structure on East Trent Avenue. Located immediately west of the Trent Avenue Bridge, the building sits at the juncture of east Spokane's industrial sites and downtown commercial and institutional uses. The Cascade Laundry Company building's basic form is rectangular, made irregular with a triangular front-facing office section, and a one-story wood-framed masonry annex located on the southeast elevation. A notable feature of the Cascade Laundry Company building is the large red brick piers framing divisions at the building's corners and offset entry. The exterior of both the small structure and its connecting section consists of red brick laid in common bond, with a concrete band below the cornice at eye level.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Cedars Apartments<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Ehwald J. Baum<br>
Common Name: Cedars Apartments<br>
<br>
Reminiscent of large, rambling baronial manor halls built throughout the English countryside, the Cedars Apartments was built in 1911, and is an exemplary, artful expression of Tudor Revival styling adapted to a multi-family apartment house. A steeply pitched red tile roof, seven front-facing gables, clinker brick cladding, false half-timbering, and rich ebony-finished woodwork are a few of the building's architectural elements that are indigenous to the Tudor Revival style. Designed as a luxury apartment block with multiple rooms in each apartment suite, the Cedars Apartments was pictured in a 1911 Spokesman-Review newspaper article that described the building as "attractive English apartments." Designed by Ehwald J. Baum, the building was constructed for Hattie Jane Parsons, a "long time resident of Spokane" who was "prominent in community business circles." Well preserved, the Cedars Apartments has operated as a multi-family residence for nearly 100 years.<br>

Common Name: Central Schoolhouse, District 49<br>
<br>
This one-room schoolhouse has served as a focal point for both educational and social activities in northwest Spokane County since the turn of the twentieth century. At the time of construction in 1900, there were a number of other one-room schoolhouses in the area, but this is the only one from that time that remains. The building served as a school continuously until 1956 when students at Central School were consolidated with those at Reardan. The Coulee Township acquired the building in 1958 as a meeting house, and today the building is owned by the West Greenwood Cemetery District No. 2 and serves as a center for community gatherings and events.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Central Steam Heat Plant<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1916<br>
Architect: Kirtland Cutter and Malmgren<br>
Common Name: Steam Plant Square<br>
<br>
One of Spokane&#39;s most prominent skyline features, the Central Steam Heat Plant, with its graceful twin smokestacks, is historically significant for its role in the evolution of the power industry in the Inland Northwest, and its seventy-year contribution to sustaining a major share of downtown Spokane&#39;s buildings. Built in 1916, it provided heating to more than 300 Central Business District (CBD) structures. Designed by renowned Spokane architects Cutter &amp; Malmgren, the Steam Plant&#39;s architecture is notable both for its engineering and design. It exhibits particular quality in its construction and attention to finished detail. The equipment was innovative in the Inland Northwest in 1916, when it began operation. Representative of an enterprise common but frequently short-lived in a number of cities across the northern states, the plant underwent a series of changes in the generation of heat and power and remained operational until 1986. After a period of vacancy it was renovated and reopened as Steam Plant Square, offering unique restaurant, office, and commercial spaces.<br>

The George &amp; Blanche Christensen House was built in 1926 on the edge of a steep bluff in the prominent, tree-lined Rockwood Terrace Addition. Mimicking style elements borrowed from medieval architecture and reminiscent of the whimsical dwellings and cozy cottages illustrated in children&#39;s nursery rhymes and storybooks of the 1920s, the Christensen House is an eclectic mix of Tudor Revival and Storybook styling. Characteristic architectural features include the home&#39;s irregular rambling footprint, steeply pitched roof with multiple lower cross gables, pointed and flared gable peak crockets, a front-facing full-height tapered brick chimney, an arched recessed front entrance, smooth stucco wall cladding, and leaded-glass casement windows. Celebrated Spokane craftsman and stone/brick mason John Anderson built the home for Blanche and George Christensen, the president and general manager for Western Piggly Wiggly grocery stores in the area.<br>

Constructed in 1903, the George and Clara Clark House was built during the first phase of single-family construction along East Mission Avenue, between the 200 and 800 block, what is today identified as the Mission Avenue National Historic District. In 1986, the Clark House was designated as a contributing historic resource of the Mission Avenue District. The Clark House is an excellent example of the Free Classic Queen Anne style. The Clark House was constructed for George E.

<b>Title:</b> Clemmer Theater<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1915<br>
Architect: E. W. Houghton and Kirtland Cutter<br>
Common Name: Bing Crosby Theater<br>
<br>
Excavation for this theater, built by mining magnate August Paulsen, began March 3, 1914. Known as both the Lincoln Theater and the Paulsen Theater during construction, the building became better known under the name of its first lessee, Dr. Howard S. Clemmer, a former dentist who recognized the potential of motion pictures through his father's work in the movie business. The Clemmer Theater opened for business February 22, 1915, and operated under that name until Ray Grombacher purchased it and renamed it the Audian in 1930. In 1932, it reopened as the State Theater, the name it bore until 1985. The Met, as it is currently known, features live performances and serves as the home of the Spokane Opera. The theater was not limited to motion picture features; Bing Crosby gave his last Spokane appearance at the Clemmer before going to Hollywood. In 1964-65, "Sound of Music" played for 54 straight weeks, the Spokane record for the longest-run motion picture.  The English-born architect, E. W. Houghton, was well known for his theater and hotel design; his other works include the Seattle Opera House and the Rainier Hotel. Spokane's premier architect, Kirtland Cutter, served as the site architect for the building.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Cohen House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Ralph &amp; Ella Belle Cohen House<br>
<br>
The Ralph &amp; Ella Belle Cohen House is architecturally significant as an excellent interpretation of the Craftsman style. The home demonstrates trademark features of the Craftsman aesthetic, including an accentuated horizontal emphasis and the use of organically integrated building materials. These features are evident in widely overhanging eaves that cast horizontal shadows on the planar wall surface of the house, exposed rafter tails, a wide front porch, a combination of irregular black basalt rock/course, stucco/narrow width wood clapboard siding, decorative horizontal bands that separate exterior cladding materials, and original 1/1 and multi-paned windows. A fine blend of outdoor living and indoor open spaces, the design for the Cohen House epitomizes the Craftsman ideal with a large great room for living and dining that extends outside to a spacious covered front porch. Constructed for investor and mortgage broker Ralph Cohen and his wife, Ella Belle Cohen, the house was one of the first built in the Cannon Hill park neighborhood. The house reflects early twentieth century building and development trends associated with prominent residential neighborhoods in early Spokane.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Isaac J. Galbraith<br>
Common Name: Commercial Hotel<br>
<br>
Isaac J. Galbraith designed the Commercial Block for Dr. Joseph Gandy and his wife, Harriet Ross Gandy, on property Mrs. Gandy owned. It was one of the first mixed-use buildings in the neighborhood, built to serve Spokane's working class. Original tenants of the ground floor commercial space included the Palace Meat Market and the Crescent Furniture Store. The upper floors served as apartments until 1970 and as hotel space until the early 1980s. A 1910 survey of tenants showed them to be employed, unmarried males and females in their twenties and early thirties who stayed in the building for a year or less. The Commercial now serves as housing for formerly homeless people. The building is historically significant as a representative example of a Single Room Occupancy Hotel, a popular form of blue-collar housing in Spokane built in Spokane in the first decade of the 20th century.<br>

Local builder James M. Geraghty erected the Commission Building in the heart of Spokane's early Produce District for the Rasher-Kingman-Herrin Company in 1906. The company was created when Henry M. Herrin's wholesale fruit and produce company merged with partners C.E. Kingman and Huber Rasher. The Rasher-Kingman-Herrin Co. remained in the building until 1915. The Roundup Fisheries Company, later Roundup Grocery, occupied the Commission Building from 1919 into the 1950s, when it built a new headquarters to the east. The Commission Building also housed the Independent Grocers Association Headquarters during the 1930s. The building has more recently been converted to condominiums.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Comstock-Shadle House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Willis A. Ritchie<br>
Common Name: Comstock-Shadle House<br>
<br>
The Comstock-Shadle House, built for pioneer merchants James and Elizabeth Comstock, is one of the best preserved historic properties in Spokane. The house is a fantastic representation of the work of Willis Ritchie, a master architect who practiced in Spokane during the late 1890s and into the 20th century. Perhaps the most historically significant feature of the house is its association with the Comstock and Shadle families, widely recognized as among the most charitable benefactors living in early 20th century Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Eugene and Josie Comstock-Shadle House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Willis A. Ritchie<br>
Common Name: Eugene and Josie Comstock-Shadle House<br>
<br>
The Eugene and Josie Comstock-Shadle House was built in 1911 and is a fine example of the Tudor Revival style. Characteristic of the style, the home displays a steeply pitched roof with a slight flare at the eaves, multiple cross gables, three prominent front-facing gables at the facade, a covered front porch and false half-timbering with stucco infill. The interior of the home features a center hall plan with formal massing, and retains original built-ins, hand-polished woodwork, and a formal fireplace with glazed ceramic tile manufactured by Earnest Batchelder (1875-1957), a leading designer of the American Arts &amp; Crafts movement and founder of the Batchelder Tile Company in Pasadena, CA. The house was built by James M. Comstock, one-time mayor of Spokane, and designed by prominent architect Willis A. Ritchie.  Eugene Shadle and Josie Comstock-Shadle, partner and daughter of Comstock, respectively, resided in the home<br>

Architect: John W. Cook<br>
Common Name: John W. Cook House<br>
<br>
The J.W. Cook House, a superb example of the free classic Queen Anne style, is the oldest house in the Lincoln Park Addition. Constructed during the turn of the century when most farm houses in the area were frame buildings, the brick masonry-supported Cook House is one of five remaining brick houses built in unincorporated Spokane County before 1910. In addition, the house is the product of master craftsman John W. Cook, and is the only house found in all of Spokane County that features a unique application of decorative stucco that simulates brick veneer. The property retains excellent exterior integrity in its original location, setting, materials, workmanship, and its association with early Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Coolidge-Rising House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: John K. Dow<br>
Common Name: Coolidge-Rising House<br>
<br>
The Coolidge-Rising house is a Craftsman-style residence located on a double lot on Spokane's lower South Hill. The house is characterized by the restrained structural features associated with the Craftsman style. The overhanging eaves of the roof are open with exposed decorative rafter tails. The house is historically significant for its associations with two leaders in the commercial development of the region during the early twentieth century. Financier Alfred Coolidge, who built the house, was a founder, president, and director of banks in both Spokane and Whitman counties, as well as an officer in an investment firm and a mining company. Henry Rising, who purchased the home in 1924, was the long-time editor of The Chronicle and president of the parent publishing company. As a prominent banker and journalist-publisher, the two men played influential roles in the development of the Inland Empire, and the well-preserved Craftsman style house reflects the status of the men and their achievements.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1908<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter<br>
Common Name: Corbet-Aspray House<br>
<br>
The Corbet-Aspray House is one of Spokane's finest renditions of architectural eclecticism. Master craftsman Kirtland Cutter designed the house for noted Spokane mortgage banker James Corbet and his wife Ruth, and was later home to Melvin and Grace Aspray. A prominent medical practitioner, Dr. Melvin Aspray was one of the first in Spokane to specialize in radiology; he subsequently assisted in establishing the radiology department at Sacred Heart Medical Center. Grace Aspray was widely recognized for her service to the community as a civic benefactor and philanthropic leader. The Corbet-Aspray House demonstrates turn-of-the-century community development in Hill Park Addition along once-prestigious West Seventh Avenue and is one the few homes to survive the onslaught of commercial encroachment and demolition of the Hill Park neighborhood in the past fifty years.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Corbin House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1898<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter<br>
Common Name: Corbin Art Center<br>
<br>
As an 1898 Colonial Revival Residence built on a 4.5 acre site, the Daniel and Anna Corbin House is one of a series of mansions that once sat along the base of the north-facing slope of Seventh Avenue. The symmetrical facade has a central entry framed by Tuscan columns and a full-width porch that extends around each side elevation from octagonal corners. Over the entry portico on the second level is a porch with balustrades and a three-part center window. Above, on the hipped roof, are three dormers, the central boasting a Palladian window. The home is well-preserved and exhibits a high level of exterior and interior integrity.  Its adaptive reuse as an art center after a 1921 fire has introduced only minor changes to the second floor rooms. A series of restorations included porch and foundation repair, replication of the once-missing second-level balustrade, and painting of exterior wood surfaces in original shades. The interior walls, woodwork, doors, and lighting fixtures have been returned to near-original condition as well.<br>

The Cowley School is a finely crafted vernacular example of a small schoolhouse with Collegiate Gothic-style elements identified in a stepped parapet, brick exterior wall cladding, and a Tudor-Gothic entry arch with sculpted tracery embellishment. The school building is the only public school ever constructed in Peaceful Valley and is one of few historic public schools remaining in Spokane. The building was named for Reverend Henry T. Cowley, one of Spokane's most accomplished leaders and one of the first pioneers to arrive in 1874 when settlement of the town was just beginning. Cowley's business and civic contributions span a wide range from missionary work with the region's Spokane Indian tribes to Presbyterian Church organization and leadership, real estate development, and the establishment of the Spokane Daily Chronicle.<br>

The Crescent Building sits in the heart of downtown Spokane and shares its historical traditions with such contemporaries as Old City Hall, the US Bank Building, and the Smith Funeral Home. The seven-story building was erected in 1919 to house the fast-growing Crescent Store. Owners Robert B. Paterson and Captain J.M. Comstock hired prominent Spokane architect L.L. Rand to design the building to fit the future needs of store customers. Bay windows covered the entire street level of the store, making window shopping a new and exciting experience for those visiting the Crescent. Windows also decorate every floor of the building, giving the store not only a unique quality, but also allowing a much more open and inviting look. Stylistically, the building reflects Rand's emphasis on detail, with brackets, cartouches, and cornice elements executed in white-glazed terracotta.<br>

Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Geeks on Wheels<br>
<br>
The Culton-Moylan-Reilly Auto Company and the Fisk Rubber Company buildings served automobile-related uses until recently. Their long association with Spokane's automobile industry ties them to the development of this area's transportation history. Though not remarkable for their architecture, they are nonetheless representative of the type of buildings associated with the evolution of the automobile. Over eighty years old, they were among Spokane's earliest structures completed specifically for automobile sales and service. In recent years, the number of the one-story automobile-related buildings has diminished. They represent a building type that was once numerous, but is disappearing in the west downtown area. Their collective facades, designed as a visual unit, add to their architectural character. Daniel H. Dwight, a member of one of Spokane's earliest pioneer families, built the first two, and was associated with development of the third. Dwight heirs have maintained an ownership interest.<br>

Built in the waning years of the railroad era, the Davenport was an important measure of the urbanity and sophistication of Spokane and the inland empire of eastern Washington, Idaho, and the mining country of western Montana. Like the imposing baronial hotels of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, the Davenport was designed to present an outpost of elegance in a major city along the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railroads.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1891<br>
Architect: David B. Fotheringham<br>
Common Name: David B. Fotheringham Residence, Fotheringham Bed &amp; Breakfast<br>
<br>
This house is significant as a contributing building in the Browne's Addition Historic District and as the family home of David B. Fotheringham, a successful building contractor and community leader. Fotheringham lived in a temporary home situated next to this house as it was constructed. He finished in 1891, the same year he became Mayor of Spokane. After moving in, Fotheringham turned his attention to the lot across the street to the west, where he built the opulent Patrick Clark Mansion, designed by Spokane's best known architect, Kirtland Cutter. Fotheringham remained in this house until 1926 when Fay E. and Ina Dobson purchased the home and converted it into an apartment building. In 1984, the house was partially restored and remodeled to accommodate a bed and breakfast, which continues to exist today.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1936<br>
Architect: Gustav A. Pehrson &amp; Frank G. Hutchinson<br>
Common Name: Victor and Georges Dessert House<br>
<br>
Begun in 1913 and completed in 1936, the Dessert House is one of Spokane's most unique homes. The home was erected for Victor Dessert and his wife Georges Wilson Dessert, two prominent civic benefactors, city leaders, and founders of the Dessert Hotel chain which included seven hostelries built in Spokane, Ritzville, and Coeur d'Alene.  Perched high atop a rocky precipice above Rockwood Boulevard, the home commands a spectacular view and is an excellent - and rare - representation of the Spanish Eclectic style. With its stucco cladding, multi-level red tile roof and multiple units, the Dessert House resembles the compound plans and varied roof forms associated with Spanish villages. The castle-like thick black basalt rock foundation, curved rock terraces, and rock stairways were designed by Frank G. Hutchinson while the house was designed by Gustave Albin Pehrson.<br>

<br>
The Senator Clarence and Mabel Dill House is a fine rendition of the Spanish Eclectic style and is one of the largest single-family dwellings in Spokane, WA. Resembling a block of homes in a Spanish village, the Dill House is grandiose with six stories, seven varying roof levels, and numerous wings, bays, balconies and decks. The Dill House is the largest and one of the best residential examples of the work of prominent architect Frederick E. Westcott. The house sits on a sheer cliff and commands of the most spectacular views of Spokane and surrounding northern mountain peaks and was constructed for prominent attorney and former United States senator Clarence Cleveland Dill, and his wife Mabel Dickson Dill, a dietician and educator who founded the home economics department at Whitworth College. During his tenure in Washington, D.C., Senator Dill spearheaded a plan and secured a promise from then-New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt for the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington.<br>

Built in 1913 and 1922 respectively, the Dodd House &amp; Garage are excellent examples of the Craftsman style. The property was built for John Bruce Dodd, a Prudential Insurance Company agent and Spokane businessman, and his wife, Sonora Smart Dodd, a prominent Spokane artist, poet, civic benefactor, philanthropist, and founder of Father&#39;s Day. From 1913 to 1950, the Dodd House achieved significance as the home of Sonora Smart Dodd, who is recognized around the world as the woman who created and promoted official city and federal recognition of Father&#39;s Day. Sonora Dodd&#39;s tireless work while residing in the Dodd House led to an official proclamation signed by United States President Richard Nixon in 1972 which made Father&#39;s Day an American holiday observed each year in June by millions of people throughout the country. Praised for enriching the religious, civic, and cultural life of Spokane, and for &quot;giving Spokane credit in the eyes of the nation and the world,&quot; Sonora Smart Dodd&#39;s far-reaching contributions were summarized by the Spokesman-Review at her death: Honor for thousands of fathers everywhere and for her home city through [the] establishment of Father&#39;s Day is an everlasting epitaph for Mrs. John Bruce Dodd.<br>

The home&#39;s design, materials, and craftsmanship are typical of the early twentieth-century Craftsman style and are evident in the covered front porch, widely overhanging roof eaves, scroll-sawn brackets, wood shingle wall cladding, cut stone foundation, thick brick porch wall, and large square brick porch piers. The house was built for Genevieve Paterson Doran and her husband, John Doran, a noted civic leader, city benefactor, and successful businessman who owned and operated the John Doran Company.<br>

Erected in 1911 as a plain two-story brick masonry building, the Dowling &amp; Cattle Warehouse is a good representation of the industrial/commercial warehouse building type. The structure was built for plumber Patrick J. Dowling and real estate investor Alfred T. Cattle, business partners who use the building for storage and also leased the space to various renters. After 1936, the building served as a storage, drayage, and distribution headquarters for a number of local businesses. The Dowling &amp; Cattle Warehouse exhibits architectural significance as part of a unique, contiguous facade of mostly two-story commercial vernacular industrial/commercial warehouse buildings that were erected in the first part of the twentieth century in east downtown Spokane.<br>

The Dry Goods Realty Building is architecturally significant as an example of the restrained yet elegant styling of the industrial buildings constructed in Spokane at the turn of the century. The aesthetically attractive design and subtle architectural compatibility with the building's notable counterpart the Crescent Warehouse reflects the value merchants placed on the architectural styling of even working-class buildings. The building is historically significant for its association with James M. Comstock and Robert B. Paterson and their associates Eugene A. Shadle and James L. Paine, founder of the Crescent Department Store, one of Spokane's most eminent business enterprises. The Dry Goods Building demonstrates the development of Spokane's business district, as the building was used for both warehouse and retail purposes in the downtown transportation corridor.<br>

The Duquesne Apartments building is historically significant for its association with Spokane's most rapid period of growth from 1900 to 1910. Built in the Commercial Vernacular style essentially unaltered from the time of construction, the building exhibits the predominant characteristics of a single-room occupancy hotel, although the structure functioned as an apartment building. The living units were small rooms with no kitchen or bathroom, only a sink. The Duquesne has operated continuously as a lower to middle income apartment building from its construction in 1904 to ca. 2006. The building is a rare example in the downtown of a mid-block freestanding apartment building.<br>

<br>
Built in 1910 and 1915 respectively, the Jimmie &amp; Margaret Durkin House &amp; Garage are excellent examples of the American Arts &amp; Crafts tradition expressed in the Craftsman style. Typical of many large homes built in this tradition, the Durkin House is a full two stories with a low-pitched hip roof and low-slung hip dormers. With an emphasis on horizontal lines and organic integration, the home is clad with &quot;natural&quot; building materials, including black basalt at the foundation, cobbled and coarse textured clinker brick at the first floor, false half-timbering and stucco infill on the second floor and gable peaks with wood trim, all typical of the Craftsman style. The home&#39;s facade is dominated by a full-width front porch on the first floor which renders a strong Craftsman-inspired horizontal orientation in both shadow and design. The house and garage retain excellent integrity in location, design, materials, workmanship, and association as Craftsman style buildings from the early twentieth century in Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Dutton House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Isaac J. Galbraith<br>
Common Name: Julius M. Dutton House<br>
<br>
The Julius M. Dutton House demonstrates American Foursquare form with Colonial Revival and Craftsman influences. The form is named for the fact that both ground and second stories feature a room in each corner, creating a square, box-shaped footprint. The Dutton house is an unusual interpretation of the style, which compares favorably with other homes in the Sherwood Addition, a popular streetcar suburb in Spokane's West Central.  The most prominent and unique features of the Dutton House are the half-round openings at the porch where other houses might display simple drain openings for an enclosed half porch, and the graceful oval window in the center of the upper facade. The Dutton house typifies one of the popular styles in the growing suburbs, often promoted in pattern books, although it was not as common in West Central. As such, it is a remaining embodiment of a phenomenon that was occurring throughout the city and across the nation at the turn of the century.<br>

The following year, Dybdall constructed a turbine-driven grist mill on Rock Creek, just below the southern tip of Chapman Lake. The mill stands today, with the original equipment in place. The site is a complex, multi-stage operation that required considerable technical understanding and engineering ability to assemble. Some supplemental machinery was installed in 1910, although the process itself remain basically unchanged. At its peak in the 1920s, the Dybdall Grist Mill produced 30 barrels of flour a day. As a result of its eight-stage roller grinding process (in comparison to the standard six-stage process), the mill was well-known throughout the area for the finest baking flour available.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Ehrenberg House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: John Walter Ehrenberg<br>
Common Name: Gus &amp; Florence Ehrenberg House<br>
<br>
The Gus &amp; Florence Ehrenberg House was built in 1911 in the Ehrenberg Subdivision, part of the Altamont Addition in East Central Spokane. The home is in excellent condition and is a hallmark example of the Craftsman style applied to a single-family residence. Skillfully articulated, some of the windows have thick beveled-glass lights that are divided by lead strips, which form multi-faceted geometric diamond-shaped patterns. Interior Craftsman-style details include a spacious reception hall/living/dining room and handcrafted hand-polished fir woodwork. The home&#39;s original design, horizontal emphasis, and natural building materials (stucco, clinker brick, wood, metal) all work together to form the handcrafted &quot;back to nature&quot; aesthetic synonymous with the Craftsman tradition.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Eldridge Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1925<br>
Architect: Gustav Pehrson<br>
Common Name: Eldridge Building<br>
<br>
The Eldridge Buildings is historically significant as a distinctive example of the commercial structures associated with the evolution of the automobile culture. Constructed in 1925 for one of the Northwest's leading Buick dealerships, the Eldridge Building was acclaimed as "The largest building in the state of Washington devoted to the sales and service of motor cars." Located on West First Avenue, the building established an anchor for an area of downtown Spokane historically linked to commercial transportation resources. Associated with the carriage trade before 1910, First Avenue, along with Sprague Avenue between Madison and Cedar, came to be known as "automobile row" by the mid-1920s. The building, which incorporated numerous modern features and innovations, is architecturally significant as an indicator of the versatility and skill of G. Albin Pehrson, one of Spokane's most influential architects.<br>

The Elk's Temple lies in the heart of the Riverside Avenue Historic District, along a serpentine section of Riverside Avenue designed in accordance with the recommendations the renowned Olmsted Brothers Landscape Architecture firm submitted to the Board of Park Commissioners.  The Elks were the most popular organization in the city when the building was constructed in 1919.  In fact, the Spokane lodge boasted membership second only to the club in Los Angeles. The building's ornate but dignified exterior, designed by Spokane's most celebrated architect Kirtland Cutter, is in the Second Renaissance Revival style. The property is now owned by the North Coast Life Insurance Company, which won an Award of Outstanding merit from the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation for its certified rehabilitation of the building in 1983.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Empire State Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built:1900<br>
Architect:John K. Dow<br>
Common Name: Great Western Building<br>
<br>
The Empire State Building, known today as the Great Western Savings and Loan Building, is one of the most attractive buildings in Spokane's central business district. The six-story building is linked to one of the most historic architectural groupings in the city. The street elevations of the building are defined by continuous vertical piers and arcades from the third through fifth stories. Horizontal movement is achieved by string courses at second, third, and sixth floor levels and by an elaborate cornice along the roofline. In addition, a curved corner at the intersection of these elevations continues the horizontal line of decorative spandrels and fenestration. The use of buff brick facing is unusual in Spokane where the majority of older commercial structures are finished with red brick. Today the Empire State Building is the best remaining example of architect John K. Dow's skill in the design of business structures.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1890<br>
Architect: Herman Preusse/Rollin Charles Hyde<br>
Common Name: The Fernwell
Rollin Charles Hyde, brother of Eugene Hyde who built the Hyde Block, built this structure in the aftermath of the Spokane fire of 1889. Originally known as the Chamber of Commerce Building, the structure became known as the Fernwell in 1893 and has continued under that name. The building housed a men's clothing store on the ground floor for over ninety years. Preusse saw many of his first buildings destroyed by the 1889 fire, but those that remain today are almost exclusively brick and feature vernacular Romanesque theme. Born in Germany in 1847, Preusse received architectural training in Europe and was thoroughly skilled in design and drafting upon his arrival in Spokane Falls in 1882. Among his creations are several buildings in the central business district, the Gonzaga Administration Building, several Catholic churches, and private residences in the Logan neighborhood.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Finch Mansion<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1898<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren<br>
Common Name: Virginia Apartments and Annex<br>
<br>
The John A. Finch house is a Georgian Revival mansion representing three interrelated aspects of Spokane's history: mining, wealth, architectural excellence and the development of Browne's Addition - Spokane's first society district. Kirtland Cutter, the city's most prolific and influential architect from 1889 to 1923, designed the house in 1898 for John Aylard Finch, developer of the Hecla Mine. The Georgian Revival was a relatively new departure for Cutter; only a few other Cutter houses were executed in the same style. One of three Cutter-designed houses built in 1898 on the same block of First Avenue in Browne's Addition, the Finch Mansion firmly established the elegance of the district, and helped to set the high architectural standard of district residences. The home was occupied by the Finch family until 1915, and continued as a private residence until 1927. More recently known as the Virginia Apartments, the house remained a luxury dwelling until the end of World War II when the original furnishings were auctioned. Despite alterations, the Finch Mansion retains enough of its original grandeur to very convincingly communicate the tremendous wealth and expressive lifestyle of its original owner.<br>

The First Congregational Church of Spokane, built in 1890, is perhaps the most historically significant of Spokane's numerous churches. While few other congregations dared build more than a frame building, the First Congregationalists opted to build a lasting monument to their faith. The massive three-story Norman structure proved to be the standard of architecture for other Spokane churches. The rough cut granite building is one of the earliest stone churches in the Inland Empire and today is the oldest standing church in the City of Spokane. While of architectural merit, the history of this building has had a greater impact on Spokane by virtue of its pioneer development and continuity.<br>

Built in 1954, the bank also represents a unique point in time with regards to post-WWII construction in Spokane, the evolution of bank architecture in America and the development of the skywalk system in the downtown core.  Originally clad in a cream-colored glazed ceramic tile, the bank would receive an even more modern look in 1966 when the promising firm of McClure &amp; Adkison designed the present day granite skin.  Although not prominent in size, the sleek black granite and glass box exemplifies the characteristics of the mid-century period with its simple, yet elegant design of panels and glass.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1939<br>
Architect: Charles Wood<br>
Common Name: Five Mile Prairie School<br>
<br>
Strategically centered in the heart of Five Mile Prairie, the Five Mile Prairie School is one of the oldest and best preserved two-room schoolhouses in north Spokane County. From 1939 until its closure in 1970, the school served the residents of the area as the community's public elementary school. The building not only provided public education to children on Five Mile Prairie, but also served as a community meeting place for political, religious, benevolent, athletic, and other civic social gatherings. The schoolhouse symbolizes the citizens' long-standing commitment to education and community development, and is a beloved public landmark. Associated with the evolution of public education in Spokane County and Washington State, the Five Mile Prairie School reflects early twentieth-century best practices in public school construction, including fire-resistant building materials and preferred school design for classrooms. Historically and architecturally significant, the Five Mile Prairie School gained importance in the areas of education and architecture during its period of significance from 1939 to 1954.<br>

Common Name: Fred J. and Alice Flint House<br>
<br>
The Fred J. and Alice Flint House was constructed in 1888, soon after Nettleton's Addition was platted in the West Central neighborhood in 1897. Built for Fred J. Flint, president of the Flint Investment Company, the home is a fine early example of the Tudor Revival style. Flint came to Spokane in 1882 from Seattle and promptly began a lucrative real estate business with partner Fred B. Grinnell. In 1890, Flint married Alice L. Gray, the daughter of a Boxport, Maine ship captain. The home was sold to William T. Shelton in 1926, who lived there for nearly 30 years. From 1888 to 1926, the Flint House achieved historic significance for its association with the architectural development and settlement of the West Central neighborhood, and is architecturally significant as an example of the Tudor Revival style.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Folsom House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: W.W. Hyslop<br>
Common Name:Myron &amp; Maud Folsom House

Built in 1910, the Myron &amp; Maude Folsom House is a particularly fine example of the Tudor Revival style with strong Storybook influence. Reminiscent of cottages clustered in valleys and hamlets throughout the English countryside, the Folsom House is articulated with prominent false half-timbering and multiple clipped jerkinhead gables, widely overhanging eaves, and deep bargeboards that simulate the look of thatched roof cottages. The house was designed by one of Spokane&#39;s most noteworthy and accomplished pioneer architects, W.W. Hyslop, and was featured in The Inland Empire Architect, Volume 1. The journal pictured a prominent photograph of the house, drawings of the home&#39;s floor plans, and a description that characterized the Folsom House as a &quot;model residence&quot; with a &quot;carefully studied&quot; interior and exterior. The property was custom-designed and built for Myron Archer Folsom and his wife Maud, who lived there from 1910-1917 during the zenith of Myron Folsom&#39;s professional career in Spokane. As a civic leader, pioneer lawyer, and prominent professional litigator in Spokane during the late 1890s and early 1900s, Myron Folsom was featured in The History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County. The Folsom House achieved importance in the area of significance of architecture, as a noteworthy example of the Tudor Revival style with Storybook influence and as a product of W.W. Hyslop.<br>

<br>
Built in 1910, the Foresters of America Hall is typical of Lodge Hall/Commercial Vernacular architecture, with a large open meeting room (lodge hall) on the second floor and commercial space on the ground floor. Rising from a basalt rubble basement, the two-story building is on the southeast corner of Pacific Avenue and Browne Street in the southeast quadrant of Spokane's central business district. Clad in red brick with terra cotta trim, the building exhibits decorative design features, specifically at the ground floor entrances and the second floor windows characteristic of a fraternal lodge hall. Although storefront window bays on the ground floor west elevation and corner entry have been altered, the building retains good integrity of design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.<br>

The Fort George Wright Barracks, now Randolf Arms Apartments, is a part of former Fort George Wright, named for the officer who led the 1858 punitive expedition against the Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes, Palouses, and other area tribes involved in a skirmish with troops under Colonel Steptoe some months earlier. The fort is a significant reminder of Spokane's long military history.  The two barracks are U-shaped red brick neo-colonial Georgian structures with verandas extending along the front elevation on the first and second stories.  Before being transformed into apartment buildings, the Barracks were used in the 1950s as a headquarters for SAC.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Fotheringham House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1889<br>
Architect: Unknown (probably David Fotheringham)<br>
Common Name: Red House<br>
<br>
This house is significant as a contributing building in the Browne's Addition Historic District and for its association, though brief, with David B. Fotheringham, a successful building contractor and community leader who served as Mayor of Spokane. Fotheringham built this house in 1889 and occupied it with his wife Mary while he built his permanent home in the adjacent lot, completed in 1891. After building his house, Fotheringham turned his attention to the site across the street where he constructed the opulent Patrick Clark mansion. Mrs. Mabel C. Williamson, widow of Victor Williamson, bought Fotheringham's first house in 1915, remaining there until 1960. James L Red, a Spokane salesman, bought the house around 1970, and the property today remains in the hands of the Red family as a single-family residence.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Fox Theater<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1930<br>
Architect: Robert Reamer; Whitehouse &amp; Price<br>
Common Name: Fox Theater<br>
<br>
Although movies had been shown in downtown theaters for some time, the construction of the Fox in 1920 marked the first time that a motion picture company had built its own theater in Spokane. Architecturally, the Fox is one of two significant and progressive buildings that mark the culmination of Seattle architect R.C. Reamer's distinguished career. The modernistic style, the use of poured in place concrete, and the abstract, stylized ornamentation was up-to-date and sophisticated. For the conservative Washington public, these experiments in softer modernism were received with mixed reviews at their opening, but were also recognized for their innovation for helping to place Spokane on the national map architecturally.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Frederick House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1927<br>
Architect: Leon L. Rood<br>
Common Name: Walter and Mabel Frederick House<br>
<br>
The Frederick House was constructed for Walter E. Frederick and his wife, Mabel, in 1927. Walter was employed as a salesman for Shaw &amp; Borden Printing Company, a prominent printer-engraver-stationer in downtown Spokane. Mabel Rue Frederick was the granddaughter of Colonel David P. Jenkins, one of Spokane&#39;s earliest pioneers and the first settler on the north side of the Spokane river in 1879. Named &quot;Woman Pioneer of the Year&quot; in 1975, Mabel was praised for her civic contributions promoting growth of the Spokane Public Library&#39;s genealogical collection, and for encouraging the study of local and family history in the Spokane area. The Frederick House is also architecturally significant as a fine example of the Tudor Revival Cottage style, and as the prescribed product of protective subdivision regulations which were adopted as binding covenants in the Rockwood district in 1903. The property continues to demonstrate its association with covenants that are still in effect and run with the land in perpetuity.<br>

The Frequency Changing Station was an important part of an early electrical power and transportation conglomerate. The name most often associated with this development is J.P. Graves, who organized several small inter-urban lines into an extended system which connected Coeur d'Alene, Moscow, and Colfax with Spokane, a system known as the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad Company and finally as the Spokane, Coeur d'Alene and Palouse Railway.

The W.P. Fuller and Company Warehouse is composed of two buildings, constructed at different times and joined together to create a single contiguous property.

The one story addition also displays steel reinforced concrete walls, but the interior and roof are constructed of wood. Both buildings display the grey color of concrete on walls which still bear the imprint of the wood boards used in the forms. The Warehouse is significant as a representative of one of early Spokane's largest paint and finishing enterprises. The building is also one of the earliest examples of fireproof, steel-reinforced concrete construction erected in Spokane.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1888<br>
Architect: Kirkland Cutter<br>
Common Name: Spokane Unitarian Church<br>
<br>
Built in 1888, the Glover Mansion is one of the first houses of importance in the area commonly known as the South Hill. The home is of English Tudor design with Shingle Style influence, a common characteristic of upper-class east coast homes of the time. Renowned Spokane architect Kirtland Cutter designed this majestic home for James Nettle Glover, celebrated as the "founding father" of Spokane, an entrepreneurial pioneer, visionary and leader of the early commercial and social development of Spokane. This home is architecturally significant for its association with Cutter, as it was most likely his first major architectural effort. After the construction of Glover's home, Cutter-designed mansions quickly became immensely popular among Spokane's well-to-do. In the 1940s the Glover Mansion became the home for the Unitarian Universalist Church of Spokane.  The church remained in the home until the 1990s.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Goodyear Tire and Rubber Store and Warehouse<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1925<br>
Architect: Arthur W. Cowley<br>
Common Name: The Bookstore<br>
<br>
Built in 1925, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Warehouse is associated with the evolution of the automobile and automotive equipment sales and service business in Spokane.  The 1920s was the first decade during which buildings were built downtown specifically to house automobile sales and accessories.  The Goodyear building was the first building constructed in Spokane by a national tire company specifically as a tire warehouse with a sales office.  Although it was not in the heart of Spokane's auto row, which was centered around1st Avenue, west of Monroe Street, it had an integral role in the growing automobile business as a distribution point for automobile tires.<br>

Architect: John K. Dow<br>
Common Name: Grace Baptist Church<br>
<br>
Completed by 1908, Grace Baptist Church was one of the first churches built on the north side of the Spokane River. Designed by John K. Dow, a prominent architect who practiced in Spokane between 1884 and 1937, the building reflects a strong influence of the Gothic Revival Style. Although a number of other early twentieth century ecclesiastical buildings remain in the West Central neighborhood, Grace Baptist reflects a particularly high degree of its original architectural integrity. Later additions on the south end of the facility create only a slight distraction from this impressive local landmark.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Charlotte Graham House<br>
<br>
The history of the Charlotte Graham House, a great example of the American Four Square style, is closely intertwined with that of its neighbor to the north, the Thomas and Charlotte Graham House. That residence was built in 1896 for the Graham family who had recently arrived after building a considerable fortune through mining interests. Thomas Graham and his wife arrived in Spokane at an auspicious time. The city and the region were recovering from the financial crisis sometimes called the "Panic of 1893." The Charlotte Graham House as an excellent example of architecture during the period when newly-achieved affluence was transforming the formerly open land of the upper South Hill into a haven for Spokane's upper class citizens.<br>

Common Name: John and Alta Graham House<br>
<br>
Historically significant for its association with John W. Graham and "The Hill" neighborhood, the Graham House and carriage house are typical examples of the development and subsequent settlement of the Hill, an area built as a residential neighborhood for some of Spokane's most prominent citizens. Built in 1908, the house was the home of John W. Graham and his wife, Alta Graham, for nearly five decades until John's death in 1941 and Alta's death in 1957. During this time, John Graham coined the slogan, "If It's Made of Paper, We Have It," while he owned, operated, and expanded the John W. Graham Company into one of the finest and largest stationery, book, and office supply stores in the western United States. Today, the home is an apartment building.<br>

<br>
Large and complex with a porch wrapped around three sides, the Graham House possesses strong Victorian influences in its construction. The home was among the first houses to be built high on the South Hill as exclusive residential development had begun along the lower reaches of the Hill and only gradually crept to the heights above. The house was constructed for the family of Thomas J. Graham in 1896. Curiously, little is known about Thomas and his wife, Charlotte. Although the family was quite well off and had some connection to the mining industry, it is apparent that he was not one of the town's more visible people and instead chose a life of anonymity.<br>

<br>
The Great Northern Railway Depot Tower stands as a physical reminder of the centrality of railroads in the emergence of Spokane as a regional distribution hub during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Construction of the depot commenced in 1901. When it was completed in 1902 it was considered the finest depot west of Chicago. Countless passengers embarked and disembarked at the depot, which served famous passenger trains like the "Empire Builder." When the station was demolished in the early 1970s in preparation for Expo '74, planners retained the clock tower. It is now a conspicuous landmark in the heart of Riverfront Park, the centerpiece of the city.<br>

The Green-Hughes Printing Company Building was built in 1911 and named for the most significant owners of the building, Robert Green and Harley Hughes, who together owned and operated the Green-Hughes Printing Company from 1936 to 1951. From their printing presses on the building's first floor, Green and Hughes produced thousands of issues of Labor World, the most widely-read weekly newspaper reporting business at that time for organized labor unions operating in Eastern Washington, Northern Idaho and Western Montana. Hughes and his publication were the forerunners to the development of the Spokane Labor Council, the current body overseeing affiliated labor unions in Spokane County and part of Eastern Washington. The Green-Hughes Printing Company Building is historically significant for its association with Harley Hughes, Labor World and the development of one of East Central Spokane's warehouse and industrial districts.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Guse House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1901<br>
Architect: Loren L. Rand<br>
Common Name: Fred and Mary Guse House<br>
<br>
Built in 1901, the Fred and Mary Guse House is a fine example of the Free Classic Queen Anne style and is a product of noted Spokane architect, Loren L. Rand, a skilled exponent of the architectural profession who was ranked among the foremost in the northwest.  The property is further significant for its association with the design, development, and subsequent settlement of Browne's Addition, one of Spokane's first socially and architecturally prominent residential neighborhoods.  The property was built for Mary and Fred Guse, a pioneer Spokane grocer, and was home to the Guse family for 58 years.  Although the interior of the house was modified in 1959 to accommodate three apartments, the exterior of the Guse House remains intact and nearly exactly depicts designs rendered in circa 1901 blueprints of the property.  Remarkably well-preserved after a century of use, the exterior of the Guse House clearly conveys its original design, materials, and workmanship as a single-family residence.<br>

<br>
The historic Hazel-Merton Block was demolished in 2004.  No structure has been rebuilt on the site.
Designed by Herman Preusse in the wake of the Great Fire of 1889, the Hazel-Merton Block was a four-story brick commercial building with rough-faced stone detailing, a flat roof and a stone foundation.  It was typical of designs that Preusse rendered for buildings between 1890 and 1893, the busiest years of his career.  It was built for Charles W. Carson, a Spokane restaurateur and early occupants of the building included Edison Electric Illumination Co., the Washington Water Power Co. and William H. Cowles' Spokane Spokesman, which would eventually become the Spokesman-Review.  During Spokane's decade of phenomenal growth and corresponding building boom at the beginning of the twentieth century, the upper floors of the Hazel-Merton Block were also converted from office space into a Single Room Occupancy Hotel.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Heath House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1889<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Heath Mission Avenue House<br>
<br>
The Heath House is one of the earliest residential sections to be platted and developed north of the Spokane River. Situated on the north side of the graceful tree-lined Mission Avenue, the home is a simplified square, two-story, wood-frame Queen Anne with a one-and-a-half story back extension. The home was constructed for Sylvester Heath, a man who made significant contributions to early Spokane. Heath is credited for building the Heath Block in 1890 which served as a major contribution to downtown building following the fire of 1889. The Heath Library was also donated to the City of Spokane and represents one of several benevolent efforts.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1905<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: The Poplars<br>
<br>
Hendrickson Flats was constructed in 1905 for widow Ola Hendrickson during a period in Spokane when brick apartment buildings first began to appear. Upscale versions of the boarding house concept were already prevalent in Spokane and multi-unit brick apartment dwellings were considered a satisfactory alternative to a house, requiring less of an investment. Constructed of buff-colored brick, the apartment building was probably constructed of brick from the Washington Brick and Lime Company in Clayton, Washington, the same material utilized to construct the Spokane County Courthouse.  Hendrickson Flats was demolished in 1998.<br>

The Hill Brothers Building is one of the oldest brick commercial buildings in downtown Spokane, one of the first buildings to be built after the Great Fire of 1889. Located in the heart of the city's downtown business district, the Hill Brothers Building represents the transition from the rough-and-tumble early days of downtown Spokane to the city's more mature, more refined, post-fire downtown retail core. Formerly a frame building that housed a saloon and gaming hall, the Hill Brothers Building was rebuilt as a substantial brick structure and served as a retail establishment for over 100 years.<br>

<br>
The Hillyard High School property is the last surviving structure associated with Hillyard School District No. 122, which operated from 1907 until 1924.  With the passing of other civic structures, this buidling is one of the last  connections to the days when Hillyard governed its own affairs and funded its own undertakings.  Aside from the Hillyard associations, the high school is strongly connected to the progress of high school education in the Spokane area in general and was the precursor of the current John R. Rogers High School. Following its deactivation, the property served as an apartment dwelling housing low income families, many of whom were returning to blue collar jobs after WWII.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Hotel Upton<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Loren L. Rand<br>
Common Name: Hotel Grand Coulee, Grand Coulee Apartments<br>
<br>
The Hotel Upton is historically significant as a Single Room Occupancy hotel (SRO) in Spokane's central business district. It was built in response to an unprecedented period of growth in Spokane's history between 1900 and 1910, when the city became the regional distribution hub of the Inland Empire. Like other SROs, which appeared on nearly every block of the central business district during the period, the Hotel Upton was built to accommodate the many itinerant laborers that flocked to Spokane to benefit from the expanding industries such as mining, agriculture, lumber and railroads. The Imperial Investment Co., headed by principle owner, manager, and secretary Andrew Laidlaw, a mining and real estate investor, contracted prominent Spokane architect Loren L. Rand to design the building. Some of Rand's other notable local works include the First Presbyterian Church, the Marble Bank (now demolished), numerous schools including Lewis and Clark High School, and the Riverside and Main additions to the Crescent Building. The Grand Coulee, as the building is now known, retains the functional integrity of a typical SRO, with the ground floor given over to commercial space and housing on the upper floors. It is the western terminus of the West Downtown Spokane Historic Transportation Corridor, a National Register Historic District.<br>

<br>
Built in 1910 for Spokane physician, Thomas Hoxsey, and his wife, Leita Hoxsey, who owned the property for more than 54 years, the structure was originally two adjoining single-story brick masonry commercial buildings. During its period of significance, the Hoxsey Block contributed to the health, welfare, and social needs of the South Perry Street/Grant Park community as an important commercial hub, central gathering place, and neighborhood retail and educational anchor. The south bay of the 1910 building, and later the south bay of the adjoining 1939 building, served as the neighborhood&#39;s first and only community-based public branch library for a 65 years. The north bay of the 1910 building was the site of the Altamont Pharmacy, the neighborhood&#39;s first and only pharmacy; and the center bay was home to a kaleidoscope of grocery &amp; meat markets, variety stores, and retail shops. The 1939 building, which is nearly identical in design to the 1910 building, was occupied by Pat Noel&#39;s multiple grocery businesses and Howard Aust&#39;s market meats for 21 consecutive years, and later by shops and stores.<br>

Common Name: Charles and Susan Hussey House<br>
<br>
Built in 1905 and 1917 respectively, the house and carriage house are excellent examples of the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition expressed in the Craftsman style. The property&#39;s original design and architectural elements reflect a strong horizontal emphasis which is a prominent component of the Craftsman-style. Horizontal feathers of the property include jerkinhead gables, widely overhanging eaves, exposed rafter tails, wide bargeboards with pointed cutout tails, decorative brackets, battered double coursed shingles in combination with narrow-width clapboard siding, a covered front porch, and wide horizontal bands that separate the spaces between the basement, first floor, second floor, and gable peaks.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Hussey-Borgeson House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1887<br>
Architect: Loren L. Rand (carriage house)<br>
Common Name: Hussey-Borgeson House<br>
<br>
Built in 1887 and 1889, the Hussey-Borgeson House and its barn/stable/carriage house are two of the oldest and most intact domestic buildings in Spokane and are excellent examples of the Queen Anne Style. The carriage house and 1889 additions were designed by prominent Spokane architect Loren L. Rand; the architect of the original house is unknown. The house was built for mining and banking entrepreneur Warren Hussey and his wife Libby Shaw Hussey. It was later home to the Claus Borgeson family for over 80 years. The house is a contributing property in the Browne's Addition National Historic District but is historically and architecturally significant in its own right for its association with the early settlement and development of Spokane and as a superior example of the Queen Anne style of architecture.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Hutton Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1907<br>
Architect: John K. Dow and Clarence Hubbell<br>
Common Name: Hutton Building<br>
<br>
Levi and May Arkwright Hutton built this building from wealth made in the Coeur d'Alene mining district. May Arkwright came to the Coeur d'Alene district in 1883 and opened a boarding house where she met her future husband, Levi Hutton, a railroad engineer. The Huttons were married in 1887 and continued to live and work in the mining area, where they became involved in the labor struggles. They invested in the Hercules Mine in 1887 and in 1901 the mine struck ore, making the Huttons one of the wealthiest families in the Inland Empire. In 1907 they built the Hutton Building and upon its completion, moved into its penthouse where they spent some of their most active years. The Huttons became the leading figures in the movement for political and labor reform.<br>

Architect: George H. Keith<br>
Common Name: Hutton House<br>
<br>
Built in 1914, the Hutton House is one of Spokane's finest examples of the Neoclassical architectural style. Designed by noted Spokane architect George W. Keith, the house was built for Levi and May Arkwright Hutton--two of Spokane's most significant humanitarians and civic benefactors. Their huge financial success from the Hercules Mine and committed passion to social reform had a significant impact on Spokane and the surrounding area. An ardent supporter of the women's suffrage movement, May Arkwright Hutton's strong words and hard work led to the right of all women to vote in Washington State. Levi Hutton fulfilled his life-long dream by building the Hutton Settlement, one of the country's best-designed and longest-running orphanages. It remains in operation today.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Hyde Building and Annex (demolished)<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1890<br>
Architect:William J. Carpenter &amp; Albert Held
Common Name: Hyde Building and Annex<br>
<br>
The historic Hyde Building was demolished and removed from the National Register.
The Hyde Building replaced an earlier three-story structure of the same name on this site, which was built for owner Eugene B. Hyde and consumed in the fire of 1889. Hyde, the city's first Marshall, Chief of Police and Chief of the Volunteer Fire Department, rebuilt his building in a more elaborate fashion using imported brick from St. Louis and brick from his own brick yard in Hangman Valley. Designed by Londoner William J. Carpenter, who also designed the Miller Building, Loewenberg House, and Couer d'Alene Hotel, the structure served as U.S. Court during the 1890s and featured two of Spokane's most popular bars at the time: the 'Court Saloon' and 'Court Annex'. In 1908 after much litigation, "Little Denver," the most expensive property per square foot, was purchased to the rear of the site so lavatories could be added at all levels. Architect Albert Held designed the addition which simply became known as the Annex. The Hyde was a seven story red brick structure with granite, sandstone and terra cotta detail. Sandstone spandrels with acanthus scroll design and a sixth floor arcade were arresting details. The roof line was dominated by a steeply pitched gable parapet. Rustication of brickwork was evident on the second floor and the name was inscribed in the gable parapet.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1750<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Rock Paintings<br>
<br>
Thought to be around 250 years old, the Indian Painted Rocks are incredibly well preserved pictographs.  The paintings are made of pulverized red rock that was mixed with fish or animal oil.  While the meaning of the Rock Paintings remains unclear, they are a physical reminder of the Spokane people's occupancy and use of the Inland Northwest long before the arrival of non-indigenous people to the area. The pictographs are located near the banks of the Little Spokane River in the Little Spokane River Natural Area, in close proximity to a large village site near the Little Spokane's confluence with the Spokane River.<br>

<br>
Built in two parts in 1913 and 1927, the Inland Casket Company Factory Building is historically significant as one of the longest-operating and the only surviving casket factory building in Spokane. Designed as a three-story brick masonry industrial block with symmetrical fenestration patters, the factory is a good example of vernacular commercial architecture.  The Inland Casket Company was founded by Emil A. Skone and his two business partners, John Powers and Peter Sether, and manufactured hundreds of thousands of caskets for 65 years from 1913 to 1978 in Spokane.  The company designed, built and finished ready-made and custom-designed caskets for funeral homes and cemeteries in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.<br>

The Comstock House is an excellent example of the Tudor Revival style, demonstrating defining features including a steeply pitched roof, three front-facing gables, tall narrow windows, and false half-timbering with stucco infill. Wide bridgeboards and decorative brackets articulate the eaves. A single-story porch projects from the center front of the house and features an open-gabled portico supported by paired square porch pillars anchored to black basalt porch piers.

<b>Title:</b> James-Ammann House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Alfred Jones<br>
Common Name: James-Ammann House<br>
<br>
Constructed in 1906, the James-Ammann House was built for Thomas Francis James. At that time, James was a mining engineer for the Coeur d'Alene Mines and his life reflected the itinerant lifestyle of that profession. Born in 1859 in East Norwegian Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, James was the son of Welsh immigrants who were drawn to the anthracite coalfields opening in eastern Pennsylvania during the 1850s. In 1909, the house was purchased by Henry A. Ammann. The Ammanns were a pioneer family who arrived in Spokane in 1887. The James-Ammann house, being a contributing property in the Nettleton's Addition Historic District streetcar suburb from Spokane's most prolific period of growth and the remaining documented example of Alfred Jones Colonial Revival style, today proves itself to be a well-preserved example of both an overall pattern and a singular expression of that pattern.<br>

Common Name: Ferris House<br>
<br>
Designed in 1954 and completed in 1955, the Joel E. Ferris, ll House is an excellent example of mid-century modern and is the finest example of residential architecture by Bruce Walker. Its post and beam aesthetic reflects not only the Harvard Graduate School of Design (and one of its notable professors Marcel Breuer) where Walker was educated but the influence of Southern California architects as well. The landscape is the work of Lawrence Halprin, America's most significant landscape architect of the modern era. Among other prominent features by Halprin is the rock garden between the carport and house.  The residence and grounds were built for Mary Jean and Joel Ferris, important fixtures in Spokane's local modern design movement.  They increased awareness and appreciation for modern design in Spokane through the furniture and gift store, Joel, Inc., which they opened in 1950 in the Boothe-McClintock Building.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1924<br>
Architect: Julius Zittel, George Rasque/ F. E. Martin<br>
Common Name: Finch Elementary School<br>
<br>
The elegant John A. Finch School was designed by two of Spokane's most influential and prolific architects, Julius Zittel and George Rasque, both of whom achieved praise and admiration for their devotion to the design of educational institutions.  Zittel's Neo-classical influence is seen in the elaborate central entry.  Lovely cream-colored terra cotta scroll-work and columns frame the entrance; the words "Education is the Apprenticeship of Life" emblazoned above.  The entrance is truly striking and the lavish use of expensive terra cotta construction materials is an indication of the School District's desire to create a lasting and monumental structure dedicated to the education of the City's northwest neighborhoods, comparable to those of the more pretentious south side.  Although the final original structure was not fully completed until over twenty years after it was envisioned, the result is an outstanding example of early 20th century institutional architecture created by two of the area's most talented architects.  Originally possessing a U-shaped plan, the school has since undergone intensive restoration and has expanded into an O-shaped plan while still maintaining the integrity and feeling of the original school building.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Jones House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1909<br>
Architect: Alfred Jones (architect and builder)<br>
Common Name: Alfred Jones House<br>
<br>
Prominent Spokane architect, builder and entrepreneur, Alfred Jones, designed and built this eclectic home in 1909. A Spokesman-Review article deemed it "English" in style, but it exhibits elements of Craftsman and Victorian Stick styles as well. In addition to its architectural significance, the home is also historically significant for its association with Jones and its later association with Augustin Francis Schinner, the first Catholic Bishop of Spokane. Jones designed a number of prominent buildings in Spokane, sometimes in partnership with other prominent architects like Permain, Galbraith and Levesque. He was also an investor in several theaters in town, including the Scenic (later Scenic Vodvil), Washington (later Empress), and The Arcade. Jones scarcely had the chance to enjoy the home he designed; he relocated to Arizona due to ill health in 1911. In 1919 the Roman Catholic Church purchased the home for Schinner. The property continued to serve the church until 1968, providing a residence for three bishops. Consequently, it became a religious center for Spokane's rapidly increasing Catholic population.<br>

This apartment building was built in 1903 as a four-plex for Joseph and Bertha Kellner and their son Sidney, a salesman for M. Seller and Company (importers of wholesale and retail crockery, glassware, cutlery, willowware, stoves, and ranges). Joseph Kellner was a pioneer businessman and merchant who arrived in Spokane before the Great Fire of 1889. He operated a dry goods store downtown, developed real estate interests in Browne's Addition, and was involved in the establishment of Spokane's first Jewish temple. Other prominent Spokane figures, E. L. Richey, and later, William M. Day, were successive owners of the building. Kellner lived in the building for only two years before returning to his earlier home down the street. He later built and lived in the Marlboro Apartments. In 1943, the Kellner House was altered to accommodate apartments. A $13,600 war time housing lease was awarded by the United States Federal Government for the construction work, which was completed by Central Construction Company of Spokane. The building continues to serve as an apartment building today. In addition to its association with Kellner and other prominent figures from the city's early history, it is also architecturally significant as an example of the Colonial Revival style, and historically significant as an early indicator of the trend toward multiple family living units that characterized the development of Browne's Addition after 1905.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Kemp &amp; Herbert Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1908<br>
Architect: Alfred Jones<br>
Common Name: Auntie's Bookstore, The Liberty Building<br>
<br>
Significant architecturally as a fine example of commercial architecture in the Chicago School style, the Kemp and Hebert Building is also historically significant for its association with Charles Kemp, Henry Hebert and architect Alfred Jones.  Kemp and Hebert established the Wholesale Dry Goods Company in 1892 and formed the Kemp-Hebert Corp. in 1908 in conjunction with the opening of their new four-story building at Main and Washington.  The company continued to grow and expand through the 1920s.  The building stood vacant in the early 1940s after the death of surviving partner Kemp in 1940.  Liberty Furniture moved in during 1944, remaining until 1987.  After another period of vacancy the building was renovated by Auntie's Bookstore, the current occupant.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Kempis Apartments<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect:Alfred Jones (architect) and Christ Anderson (builder)
Common Name: Kempis Apartments<br>
<br>
The Kempis Apartments, one of the first luxury apartments erected in Spokane, was built in 1906 and has been continuously occupied for over 95 years. The Kempis was built to accommodate residents of more affluent means who sought permanent housing located away from the hustle and bustle of the city&#39;s center. The property was designed by Alfed Jones and built by contractor Chris Anderson for Maud L. Kemp, wife of Charles John Kemp, part owner of the Kemp &amp; Hebert Department Store. The apartment&#39;s garage and auto court were designed in 1920 by G.A. Pehrson. In 1995, Michael and Sarah Michalko purchased the property and remodeled the building, garage and auto court for use as luxury apartments that were rented on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. An upscale eatery was also added. Today, the Kempis is reverted back to luxury apartments and is being operated under Kempis LLC.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Kiesow-Gentsch House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Joseph T. Levesque/ W. B. Larimore<br>
Common Name: Kiesow-Gentsch House<br>
<br>
Built in 1912 in Spokane, Washington, the Kiesow-Gentsch House is architecturally significant as a quintessential example of the Craftsman style. The home depicts trademark features of the Craftsman aesthetic, including an accentuated horizontal emphasis, exposed structural members, and the use of organically integrated building materials. This is evident in a massive side-gable wood-shingle roof with exposed rafter tails and widely overhanging eaves; a spacious recessed front porch; a combination of irregular basalt, wood shingle, and vertical board-and-batten cladding; horizontal bands (string courses) that separate exterior cladding materials; mortise-and-tenon joinery; and original multi-paned casement windows. The home&#39;s interior is particularly significant for its open floor plan and exceptional square-cut woodwork/built-ins finished in the finest quality quarter-sawn oak with a rich, burnished patina. The Kiesow-Gentsch House was one of the first homes erected in the Cannon Hill Park neighborhood and was constructed for Experience &amp; Frank D. Kiesow, the secretary/manager of loans/mortgages for the Jones Real Estate &amp; Development CompanyŃthe company that developed the Cannon Hill Park Addition. The property was later owned by the Frederick &amp; Augusta Gentsch family from 1914 to 1928, owners/proprietors of a real estate/insurance/mortgage/loan business in Spokane.<br>

Henry Klein, founder of Spokane Foundry Works in 1899, commissioned the 2 1/2 story home in 1902.  The home is a relatively rare example of a brick Queen Anne style house and boasts hand-painted ceiling and wall murals featuring whimsical Art Nouveau-inspired vines, flowers and cupids.  Interestingly, the foundry is noted for manufacturing manhole covers that still cover some Spokane streets and the Klein House today maintains a preserved, decorative furnace cover made by the foundry.<br>

The Knickerbocker Apartments was added with three other apartment buildings (Amman, Breslin &amp; San Marco) to the National Register of Historic Places under a thematic nomination for apartment buildings designed by Albert Held, a well-known architect who designed many of Spokane&#39;s best-known structures. Located in close proximity to downtown, Held&#39;s apartment buildings were among the first structures in Spokane designed and built exclusively as apartments. They were elegantly designed with wealthy tenants in mind; mining magnate and civic leader Graham B. Dennis, the owner of the Knickerbocker, spent $200,000 on the building, which he lived in, and expected from Held the &quot;finest apartment house west of New York.&quot;<br>

<b>Title:</b> Knight House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Cutter &amp; Malmgren<br>
Common Name: The Knight House<br>
<br>
Built in 1910, the well-preserved Edwin Knight House is Northwest Spokane's most unique American Foursquare Style home.  The house was designed by one of Washington State's most prolific and prominent architectural teams of the early twentieth century: Kirtland Kelsey Cutter and Karl Gunnar Malmgren. It was built for Edwin Herbert Knight, a turn of the century Spokane entrepreneur and businessman who owned and operated the Diamond Drill Contracting Company, one of the first companies in town to manufacture mining machinery.  The house is historically significant for its association with the early development of Spokane's northwest corridor along the bluff overlooking the Spokane River, and for its association with Knight.  It is also architecturally significant for its unique American Four Square Style adaptation and artistic elements designed by a master architect.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Knight's Diner<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1906<br>
Architect: Pullman Car Company<br>
Common Name: Knight's Diner<br>
<br>
The railcar that houses Knight's Diner was built by the Pullman Car Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1906 and served the Northern Pacific Railroad as car number 988. During World War II the car, which had been retired to the Northern Pacific Yards in the Spokane Valley, was pressed into service as an indoctrination classroom for the war effort.  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt subsequently offered the car as a gift to a Spokane resident in appreciation of his years of voluntary service traveling the country as "Uncle Sam" in support of the war effort.  John (Jack) Knight, formerly the headwaiter at the Davenport Hotel, renovated the car for use as a diner in 1949.   Knight's Diner has retained a high degree of integrity since construction in 1906, even during its later reuse as a diner.  It is significant as both a well-preserved turn of the twentieth century all-wood Pullman car and as an outstanding example of an American roadside diner.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>

<br>
With its low-pitched front-gabled roof with widely overhanging eaves, scalloped verge board, massive decorative brackets, rough-cut wood siding and second floor balconies and gallery porches, the Koerner House is an excellent example of the American Swiss Chalet Style.  One of very few houses in this style in Spokane, the Koerner House possesses a high degree of craftsmanship.  The home was built in 1912 for Carl Koerner, a successful Spokane accountant, and his wife Mathilda.  Koerner worked on the plans himself, probably with the aid of Peter Moe, a draftsman for prominent Spokane architect Carl Jabelonsky, who may also have contributed to the design.<br>

Constructed in 1904, the Zeph Lane House was built during the first phase of single-family construction along East Mission Avenue, between the 200 and 800 block, what is today identified as the Mission Avenue National Historic District.  The Lane House is an excellent example of the Free Classic Queen Anne style with Dutch Colonial influences.  The Lane House was constructed for Zeph Lane, of Burke and Lane, a Spokane lumber manufacturer and dealer on West Broadway Avenue.  The home sold to railroad contractor George Chew in 1909.  Chew also had his own firm, Washtok and Chew, in the Mohawk Building downtown.  During the property's period of significance from 1904 to 1917, the Lane House achieved historic significance for its association with the architectural development and settlement of the Logan Neighborhood, specifically along East Mission Avenue.<br>

<br>
Built in 1909, the Larsen-Lindholm House is a landmark example of architectural design and elements popularized during the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century American Arts &amp; Crafts movement.  The house was built in the Cliff Park neighborhood on Spokane&#39;s South Hill on speculation by Spokane jewelry store owner and real estate developer Mark L. Pershall for $8,000, a sum that more than tripled the $2,500 minimum construction cost mandated in neighborhood deed restrictions.  One year after it was built, Bertha &amp; Lewis P. Larsen, a brilliant mining engineer and founder of the town of Metaline Falls, purchased the property for $10,500.  Immediately overcome by burgeoning business interests and mining obligations in Metaline Falls, the Larsens sold the home to Maurice &amp; Bertha Lindholm in 1911.  Maurice Lindholm was a successful investment securities broker and commercial photographer and owned the property for more than 35 years.<br>

Built between1911 and 1912, Lewis &amp; Clark is the oldest high school building in the city and is situated on property that has a long history with the Spokane educational system.  Despite alterations to the original building after an addition in 2001, the school retains its historic integrity.  What remains of the building&#39;s exterior continues to be one of the finest examples of the Collegiate Gothic Style in Spokane and is an outstanding example of the work of prominent Spokane architect Loren L. Rand.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Liberty Park Methodist Episcopal Church<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Unknown (possibly Leonard Starr)<br>
Common Name: Library Park United Methodist Church<br>
<br>
Liberty Park Methodist Episcopal Church is architecturally significant in its clear illustration of early twentieth-century Gothic Revival architecture and as a rare local example of the Akron Plan, a style of interior layout that became the standard for Methodist and other Christian denominations by the 1890s.  The Akron Plan is so named because the Akron, Ohio, architect, George W. Kramer, and a Methodist minister, Lewis Miller, popularized it.  Distinctive components of the plan include a corner pulpit platform and radial orientation of pews.  The architect of the church has not been documented, though family tradition holds that Leonard Starr, an architect and a member of the Liberty Park Church, designed it.  Starr worked as a draftsman for notable Spokane architect Albert Held in 1909 and 1910 and also did occasional work for Cutter and Malmgren, Spokane's most celebrated architectural firm.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Lindsley-Larsen Estate<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1914<br>
Architect: C. Harvey Smith<br>
Common Name: Lindsley-Larsen Estate<br>
<br>
The Lindsley-Larsen Estate is one of the few remaining undivided, multi-acre residential estates built in Spokane during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Built in 1914 for Maude and Edward Lindsley, owner of Lindsley Brothers Cedar Products, and was later home to Lewis P. Larsen, one of Spokane's most brilliant mining engineers, and his wife, Bertha, for more than 27 years.  The property includes the main house, a carriage house/garage, a chauffeur's cottage and garage addition, and landscaped grounds and garden features.  The grounds are particularly striking and included Rhododendron flower beds, a garden allee with a fountain, a reflecting pool, grassed game court, rock wall and other hardscape features.  Designed by Spokane architect C. Harvey Smith and built in 1914, the Lindsley-Larsen Estate is an excellent example of the Colonial Revival style.  The home won a city-wide contest held in 1921 and was honored as a "Notable Example of Architecture in Spokane" as reported in The Architect and Engineer.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Littlebrook Farm<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1944<br>
Architect: Oliver LaJoie<br>
Common Name: Littlebrook Farm<br>
<br>
Littlebrook is an incredibly well-preserved example of horizontal whole log construction which is unique to the Spokane County area.  Built between 1935 and 1944 by Oliver LaJoie, a local handyman who was hired from the unemployement office, the home was patterned after a drawing of the Red River Ranger Station in Elk City, Washington.  All of the cedar logs used in building the home were hand cut, peeled and notched; no nails or pegs were used as whole logs were coped and placed horizontally one on top of the other.  The two-story, hand hewn log home was built for John T. Little, a local businessman and County Commissioner, and his wife.  John Little played an intergral part in the business and civic development of Spokane from 1909 until his death in 1980.<br>

Common Name: Loewenberg-Roberts House<br>
<br>
The Loewenberg-Roberts house is one of Spokane's premiere examples of Queen Anne architecture and features granite window trim, decorative spindle work in the gables and a prominent turret.  The 24-room mansion was designed in 1889 for pioneer businessman, Bernard Loewenberg, a Prussian immigrant and owner of the Loewenberg Mercantile, the building later to be known as the Coeur d'Alene Hotel.  Following the stock market crash of 1893, Loewenberg went bankrupt and was forced to trade houses with E.J. Roberts in 1898.  Edward Roberts was the chief engineer of the D.C. Corbin Railway Systems and founder of the Union Iron Works along with D.C. Corbin.  The house remained in the Roberts family until 1959.<br>

<br>
The Lorraine Hotel, a single room occupancy hotel (SRO), was constructed during the city's most significant period of growth.  As the nearest SRO hotel to the Northern Pacific Passenger Depot, the Lorraine provided lodging for working class clientele, perhaps new residents to Spokane, many of whom stepped off the train at that very depot.  The Lorraine, known as the Denver Apartments after 1943, operated continuously as a modest SRO until 1971 when the upper floors were vacated.  The building was designed by Loren L. Rand, a prominent architect in the early decades of the twentieth century.  Composed of brick terra cotta and molded sheet metal, the building is distinctively detailed and a good example of a well-designed small commercial building.<br>

The Lyons house is a significant example of the American Four Square form executed with Classical design elements. The house possesses a hipped, pyramidal roof in the Four Square tradition, wide eaves, and well-crafted details like the fish scale patterning on the dormers. Designed by the architecture firm, Ballard Plannery, the Lyons house plan was one of several that a customer could select or combine in order to construct their "dream home." Arthur G. Lyons, an employment agent, had the home built by local contractor Wade H. Corbett in 1910 but by 1921 the house was occupied by restauranteur, John W. Walsh, and his wife, Helen.<br>

Built in 1912, the Mack-Kane House is an excellent example of a Craftsman Style bungalow.  The house is distinguished by a unique design, an original garage that echoes the quality, materials, and architectural elements of the house and by grounds and a basalt rock wall remnants that accentuate the property.  The home was built for Spokane attorney, Mansfield Mack, and erected by Ivan Abraham, an accomplished Spokane builder who constructed several other homes in the Rockwood District.  The house was later home for nearly 60 years to Spokane furniture maker Owen Kane and his daughter Katherine.  Unusual for its four front-facing gables and facade design and for its "artistic" interpretation of the identifying features of the Craftsman Style, the home retains excellent integrity in all respects.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Malmgren House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren<br>
Common Name: Karl Malmgren House<br>
<br>
Karl Malmgren, the architect and original owner of the house, was a partner in the noted firm of Cutter and Malmgren between 1894 and 1917.  Cutter and Malmgren was one of the most prolific and prestigious partnerships in the Northwest and their designs remain well respected.  Their many commissions included the Amasa Campbell House, the Patrick (Patsy) Clark Mansion, the Davenport Hotel and numerous other prominent residences and structures in the Spokane area and elsewhere.  As the architect's private residence, the Malmgren House provides a particularly unique reflection of this firm's architectural abilities and interests.  Completed in 1910, the house was executed on a grand scale and reflects Malmgren's own adaptation of Craftsman Style principles.  The liberal use of wood, basalt rock, tile, chimneypieces, window seats and built-in furnishings was intended to make each room seem complete before any furniture was added.  The home retains excellent integrity and is significant both in its association with Cutter and Malmgren and as an interesting example of the Craftsman Style of architecture.<br>

Spokane building contractors George and William Sillman built it during 1912 and 1913.  They sold the home to Charles Marr in 1914.  Marr, a keen businessman, became Spokane's first grocery store magnate and helped establish the first "self-service" Piggly Wiggly Stores and, later, the first Safeway supermarkets in the Spokane area.  Beginning in 1909 with one market, Marr's burgeoning grocery empire grew to include 575 stores in four major cities and two states by 1929.<br>

The Masonic Temple is a significant example of Neo-Classical Revival architecture in Spokane.

A principal structure in the Riverside Avenue National Historic District, the Masonic Temple is representative of the City Beautiful movement as it was expressed in Spokane.  Historically and architecturally significant, the building drew on the talents of many of Spokane's most influential and prominent citizens during its construction and development.  It is a reflection of the importance of the fraternal and social organizations to the fabric of the community during its growing years.  Originally completed in 1905, the Temple was the collaborative effort of two prominent Spokane architects, John K. Dow and Loren L. Rand.<br>

<b>Title:</b> McCroskey House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1923<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter<br>
Common Name: Floyd McCroskey House<br>
<br>
The McCrosky House is presumed to be the last residence in Spokane designed by the city&#39;s most renowned architect, Kirtland Kelsey Cutter.  It was built in 1923 for Floyd McCroskey, a prominent Spokane life insurance underwriter.  The land was a wedding gift to McCroskey and his wife from her parents, the Kemps, owners of the Kemp &amp; Hebert Department Store.  Located in the Marycliff-Cliff Park Historic District, the home was designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style and represents an important transition in the development of Cutter&#39;s works, reflecting the influence of his increasing connections to Southern California and the architectural styles prevalent there.  Cutter moved to California in 1923.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Mele House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1923<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Mele House<br>
<br>
Constructed in 1923, the Mele House was built during the second phase of single-family construction along East Mission Avenue, between the 200 and 800 block, in what is today identified as the Mission Historic District.  The house is an excellent example of the Craftsman style and was constructed for Pasquale (Peter) and Rosina (Rose) Mele, although it was occupied by numerous family members through the years.  Peter sold produce as part of the Mele and Son fruit and produce company located in the old Washington Market and later the Central Market, originally located on Main Street.  The home remained in the Mele family until 1990.  During the property's period of significance from 1923 to 1990, the Mele House achieved historic significance for its association with the architectural development and settlement of the Logan Neighborhood, specifically along East Mission Avenue, and is additionally architecturally significant as an example of the Craftsman style.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1901<br>
Architect: Charles F. White<br>
Common Name: Metropole Apartments<br>
<br>
The Metropole Apartment Building was constructed during the city's most significant period of growth, 1900 to 1910.  With commercial uses on the ground floor and apartments on the upper floors, the Metropole provided lodging for working class clientele in the growing downtown and it has operated continuously as an apartment building from its construction in 1901 to present day.  Charles F. White designed the vernacular brick building which retains its original architectural character as well as the characteristics features of a downtown commercial apartment building.  The Metropole maintains exterior integrity in its nicely detailed and well preserved facade.  In its role as a Single Room Occupant (SRO) hotel during this era, the Metropole was more elaborate in that each unit had a kitchen and a bathroom.  The units were intended for more permanent clientele as well as families.<br>

The Miller Building is significant for both its architecture and its role in Spokane's emergence as the urban center of the Inland Empire.  Designed by architect William Carpenter, it was built shortly after the Great Fire of 1889 and is one of the last remaining examples of his important contribution to Spokane's Age of Elegance.  The Miller Building's graceful brickwork and rich surface detail introduced to Spokane a form of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture that bore the imprint of the emerging Chicago School and Louis Sullivan.  Occupying a particularly desirable location, the Miller Block also played a role in Spokane's economic successes in the decades of unparalleled growth that followed the fire.  More recently, the building has been renovated and, together with the Whitten Block, next east, houses a luxury hotel, the Lusso.<br>

Designed by Albert H. Funk, the Moen House was built in 1938 as a single-family residence for Edward W. Moen, president of Moen-Leick Industries.  The house illustrates the defining characteristics of the Art Moderne style: a molded concrete composition of stacked angular boxes with cut out corners, contrasted by streamlined rounded walls with wrapped steel sash in horizontal arrangement.  Smooth white concrete walls in a single story step back asymmetrically in crisp rectangular blocks and streamlined curves segment the horizontal massing of the first floor.  The Moen House is an imposing, stylish and rare contribution to the Rockwood neighborhood and, indeed, Spokane itself.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Mohawk Building (demolished)<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1915<br>
Architect: John K. Dow<br>
Common Name: Mohawk Building<br>
<br>
The historic Mohawk Building was demolished in the spring of 2007.  No structure has been rebuilt on the site.
Located in the heart of the central business district in downtown Spokane, the Mohawk Building was a seven-story steel frame structure with a flat roof and poured concrete foundation and was a good example of the Chicago School style.  It was designed and built in 1915 to replace an earlier structure, of the same name, which was destroyed by a fire.  The Dodson family, part owners and occupants of the original Mohawk Building, led the rebuilding efforts.  It was architecturally significant as the work of master architect John K. Dow and for the high artistic values that his work conveys, especially in its terra cotta detailing, produced by the Washington Brick, Lime &amp; Mfg. Co.  It was also significant for its long association with the business community and its importance in Spokane&#39;s emergence as a regional distribution hub.<br>

Built by George Baker for Francis J. Engel in 1918, the Moldenhauer House is architecturally significant as a fine example of an Arts and Crafts style bungalow.  The home is especially significant, however, for its association with musicologist, Hans Moldenhauer.  Moldenhauer fled Nazi Germany for New York with his Jewish wife Margot Kuhn.  He moved to Spokane after a visit in 1939 and, after serving as a ski troop instructor at Camp Hale in Colorado, became the first student to attend Whitworth College under the GI Bill.  Having divorced, he married Rosaleen Jackman, a former student and Red Cross nurse at Camp Hale.  Together they founded the Spokane Conservatory of Music in their home at 808 S. Lincoln, where they amassed a world-renowned collection of musical documents.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Monroe Street Bridge<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Kirtland Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren (architects) and Ralston/McCarthy/Kennedy/Grieve/Cutter (engineers)<br>
Common Name: Monroe Street Bridge<br>
<br>
Spanning the Spokane River Gorge just below Spokane Falls, the Monroe Street Bridge is a city landmark.  When the structure was completed in 1911, the 281-foot concrete central span was the largest in the United States, edging out Cleveland's Rocky River Bridge by a foot, and the third longest in the world.  The design process for the bridge began in 1909 and building the grand triple-arched bridge was an arduous task.  Laborers hired by the city (fully half the eventual cost of $535,000 went to wages) dangled above the rapids below on towers and cables, working to demolish the old steel bridge, constructed in 1891, and build cribbing for the new one.  Shortly after demolition began, fill on the south bank collapsed, leading to the collapse of the old bridge. As the new bridge was being constructed, a violent windstorm destroyed weeks' worth of labor on the central arch.  City engineer J. C. Ralston, with assistance from Morton McCarthy, J. F. Greene, and P. F. Kennedy, designed the structure.  The design for the superstructure was prepared by Spokane's most celebrated firm of architects, Cutter and Malmgren.  It reflects the city's pride in its pioneer heritage, with its western decorative motifs, including chain-shaped concrete ornamentation on the railings and four "covered wagon"-shaped pavilions adorned with cast-concrete bison skulls.  Residents of Spokane, proud as they were of the grand new bridge, had to wait nearly 60 years to see it unobstructed.  In 1914, just three years after it was built, the Union Pacific Railway built a trestle across and above it.  The trestle was removed in 1973, in conjunction with preparations for the 1974 World's Fair held in Spokane.  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, all but the central span of the bridge was demolished and completely reconstructed starting in 2003. The bridge reopened in September 2005.<br>

<br>
Designed by the Montgomery Ward Engineering Department and built by Wells Brothers of Chicago, the Montgomery Ward Building is historically as well as architecturally significant to the history of Spokane.  The building occupies a spectacular site in the Central Business District overlooking the Lower Spokane Falls and River.  The building represents an important chapter in the history of American commerce and stands as one of the first local examples of the Art Deco style that was popular, albeit briefly, across the nation at the time.  The playfulness of the Art Deco style is lavishly employed in decorative floral panels and the color variation across the facade which was achieve with rose, ochre and green aggregate in the concrete mix.  Montgomery Ward remained in the building until it moved to a new store on Division in 1978.  The following year the City of Spokane purchased the building and converted it into the City Hall. Today, the third floor is home to the Historic Preservation Department!<br>

Elected on the Democratic ticket, Binkley served as probate judge for Spokane County in 1885 and 1886 and was instrumental in the development and successful growth of the Dutch-owned Northwestern &amp; Pacific Mortgage Company, the Northwestern Hypotheekbank.  He was also involved with the North Pacific Loan &amp; Trust Company&#39;s banks that loaned more than $1 million dollars for the rebuilding of the city after the 1889 fire.  Around 1898, Binkley, an avid outdoorsman, purchased more than 300 acres in the vicinity along Rutter Parkway and the Little Spokane River, a natural wetland river valley located nine miles northwest of Spokane.  He built a four-room cabin along the north shore of the river, lavishly entertained his friends and such Spokane luminaries as Louis Davenport, John Finch, and Royal Riblet with hunting and fishing expeditions and summer barbeques, affectionately calling his gentlemen&#39;s mountain valley get-away &quot;Montvale Farm.&quot;  Aubrey Lee White, who married Binkley&#39;s daughter, Ethelyn, owned the property beginning in 1928.  White, who was nicknamed the &quot;Father of Spokane Parks,&quot; was president of Spokane&#39;s first park board.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Moore-Turner Garden<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1888<br>
Architect: Hugh Bryan (landscape architect 1888-1891, post-1896 additions)<br>
Common Name: Moore-Turner Garden<br>
<br>
Developed in two main stages, the first from 1888 to 1891 and the second from 1911 to 1913, the Moore-Turner Garden is a local example of the landscape style that accompanied the Arts and Crafts Movement in America.  George Turner and his wife Bertha purchased this residential garden, first laid out by F. Rockwood Moore, in 1896.  During their ownership, the Moore-Turner Garden achieved its fullest development when the Turners commissioned Portland, Oregon landscape architect, Hugh Bryan, to supervise extensive additions.  Incorporated into the South Hill's unique geology, the property covers over five acres and offers some of the finest views of the city and was the site of the city's early mansions.  No other hillside landscape in Spokane retains the traces of its past to the same extent.  While the South Hill's other hillside gardens have been compromised or have disappeared altogether, the remnants of the Moore-Turner Garden are identifiable.  Currently owned by the Spokane Parks Department, the improvements to the infrastructure of the garden were completed in 2006 and included removing brush and debris, stabilizing the basalt walls, staircases and foundations, recovering the carriage road and installing the perimeter wrought iron fence with basalt columns.<br>

<br>
The Morgan Block is historically significant as a representative example of a Single Room Occupancy Hotel (SRO), a unique style of working class housing popular in Spokane during a period of unprecedented growth around the turn of the twentieth century.  Built to accommodate the influx of itinerant laborers who flocked to Spokane to fill jobs in the area's mining, agricultural, lumber and railroad industries, SROs once stood on nearly every block in the central business district.  The Morgan Block was designed by prominent Spokane architect Alfred Jones and was built in 1909 for Daniel Morgan, a former Washington State senator and Spokane property developer.  The building was damaged by a fire in the 1990s but has recently been rehabilitated.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: William J. Ballard, Ballard Plannery<br>
Common Name: Marguerite Motie House<br>
<br>
Built in 1910, the Marguerite Motie (pronounced mo'chee) House, garage and chicken house are fine examples of the Craftsman style.  Facing south along West 13th Avenue, the house reveals typical Craftsman-style details with 1.5 stories, a side gable roof with widely overhanging eaves and a full-width front porch.  Wide bargeboards with keyhole cutouts in the tails, battered porch pillars and hand-polished natural fir interior woodwork further illustrate the Craftsman-style aesthetic.  The property is also significant for its association with Marguerite Motie, the first and longest-reigning "Miss Spokane," an advertising symbol used in the promotion of Spokane and the Inland Northwest in the early 20th century.  Motie was selected from 138 candidates to act as an ambassador and official city hostess for the city and, as a civic figurehead, she contributed much to Spokane and the surrounding region.<br>

Located near Hillyard and Mead six miles north of Spokane, the Mount Saint Michael Seminary was built in the vicinity of the first Catholic mission serving the area.  Located high on a bluff some 500 feet above the valley floor, the building has an imposing architectural presence.  Designed by noted Spokane architect, Julius Zittel, and built in 1915, Mount Saint Michael is an excellent example of the Tudor-Gothic and Collegiate Gothic Revival styles and possesses pointed gothic arches, large window areas and vertical elements which add visual height to the structure.  Mount St. Michael is an outgrowth of the first Jesuit seminary to be established west of the Mississippi River and, since it has been in continuous use as a religious educational facility, remains a symbol of the development of Catholicism in the Pacific Northwest.<br>

Built in 1889 and named after its two most significant resident owners, Hiram Newton Muzzy and Patrick C. Shine, the Muzzy-Shine House is a high-style, landmark example of the Queen Anne tradition.  The 2.5 story house is dominated by a steeply pitched roof and is an imposing edifice of red brick and sparkly silver-colored granite.  The home was erected for Muzzy, a pioneer farmer and orchardist who came to Spokane in 1880, homesteaded 160 acres north of the Spokane County Courthouse and, upon receiving his patent, platted and sold more than 500 lots on his land, which he called Muzzy's Addition.  The second owners of the property were Shine and his wife, Mary Gomm.  Shine was a prominent Spokane attorney and politician who held various offices and government positions, served as consulate commissioner to British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and provided legal counsel to railroad companies and real estate enterprises in Oregon and Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Natatorium Carousel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1909<br>
Architect: Charles Looff<br>
Common Name: Looff Carousel<br>
<br>
The Natatorium Carousel is a product of a lost craft and is representative of one of the few arts intended solely to amuse.  Charles I. D. Looff, a renowned carousel artist, designed the "merry-go-round" in 1909 and it has been operating in Spokane ever since.  The gilded and elaborately carved carousel, adorned with leaping horses and jungle animals, is said to be the last operating carousel designed by Looff.  While most of Looff's horses were gentle, jolly creatures, those of the Spokane carousel are dashing fiery steeds that appear to race around the room.  Each animal has details that proclaim its individuality and they are decorated with brightly colored flowers, parrots, cupids, gamebirds, bedrolls and clusters of fruit.  The carousel was first located at at the famed Natatorium Park, an amusement park on the Spokane River developed by Washington Water Power in 1893 and since converted to a trailer park.  In 1975 it moved to Riverfront Park which was created in conjunction with Expo '74, the World's Fair hosted by Spokane in 1974.  The carousel was a wedding gift to Looff's daughter, Emma Vogel, and her husband, Louis Vogel, a Spokane banker and longtime owner of Natatorium Park.  The carousel is the last remnant of the popular park and a fixture at the present park downtown.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Odell House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1899<br>
Architect: Loren L. Rand<br>
Common Name: Odell House<br>
<br>
Designed by prominent Spokane architect, Loren L. Rand, the Odell House is an excellent example of the Free Classic Queen Anne-style.  At the time of its construction, the house's location was one of the most prestigious in the city.  Other recently completed grand homes, including ones for mining magnates, Amasa Campbell and John Finch that were designed by Kirtland K. Cutter, share the bluff at the west end of First Avenue with the Odell House.  An automobile garage designed by the Ballard Plannery was added in 1912.  Like surrounding homes, the Odell House is also associated with prominent figures in Spokane history.  The home was built for real estate entrepreneur and civic benefactor, George W. Odell, and his wife, Ada.  It was later home to Denis and Margaret Clark.  Clark was a wealthy miner and a brother to James and Patrick Clark, who built the nearby Patsy Clark Mansion. Sam Katzenstein, a salesman for Cohn Brother's Furniture, bought the house in 1922 and converted it to six apartments.  It remains an apartment house today.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Opportunity Township Hall<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: C. Harvey Smith<br>
Common Name: Opportunity Town Hall<br>
<br>
The Opportunity Township Hall, erected in 1912, is a unique, one-and-one-half story, Spanish Colonial Revival style building with a gracefully shaped roof parapet.  In 1905, D.K. McDonald, R. Hutchinson and A.C. Jamison founded the Modern Irrigation and Land Company and the farming community that formed around it would eventually become Opportunity.  In 1908, Washington passed a law enabling unincorporated communities to form local units of government called townships.  Now that Opportunity was officially recognized, the community needed a formal meeting place and four years later the township hall was erected.  It has served the community as a meeting place, early library and place of worship.  With "Opportunity Anno 1912" emblazoned at one point in terra cotta relief over the front entry, the Hall continues to represent the birth of a community over a century ago.  The building is now home to the Spokane Valley Heritage Museum.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Page-Ufford House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1896<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Page-Ufford House<br>
<br>
The Page-Ufford House is an excellent example of the "Free Classic" Queen Anne style. The rear of the house commands a panoramic view of Latah Creek, Latah Valley and west Spokane.  Possessing an irregular, steeply pitched hip roof, non-symmetrical facade, multiple exterior textures, a full-width wrap-around front porch and a prominent three-story circular tower, the house is certainly a high-style example of Queen Anne. The tower, which immediately draws the eyes of passersby, has its original curved windows and is topped with what is known as a witch's hat roof.  A unique distinction of the property is the unusual variety of window designs: a keyhole window, an ocular window, an oval window, a diamond window, and a large arched Islamic-shaped window with multiple decorative leaded-glass lights.  Originally built for Flora and Alba Page, a wealthy financier who owned the Page Land Company, the home was eventually purchased by Ethel and William Ufford, a well-known and successful lumberman.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Palmer-Abbeal-Sprague Farmhouse and Barn<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1895<br>
Architect: Eben Ephraim Palmer<br>
Common Name: Sprague House and Barn<br>
<br>
Completed in 1895, the Palmer-Abbeal-Sprague Farmhouse, a two-story dwelling built in a gable-front-and-wing plan, is a fine example of the Folk Victorian style and type. The farmhouse&#39;s exterior walls are clad with horizontal wood clapboard siding and original windows are tall wood-sash units.  Embellished with cornice returns, inset wall dormers and corner boards, the Palmer farmhouse is as stately now as it was in the 1800s.  The Palmer-Abbeal-Sprage Barn, which was built in 1905 as part of the farmstead, is located west of the farmhouse and was listed in 2012 on the Washington State Heritage Barn Register. A 1905 fieldstone foundation that once supported a cabbage shed is located on the property west of the farmhouse.  Framed by a manicured lawn, wild grasses and a century-old fruit orchard, the farmhouse has undergone modifications since it was built over one-hundred years ago but still retains a great deal of original character. The property retains good integrity in original location, original design, original materials, original workmanship and original association.  The house is in excellent condition as a turn-of-the-20th-century farmhouse and was rehabilitated in 2012 using guidelines from the Washington State Department of Archaeology &amp; Historic Preservation.<br>

<br>
Built in 1916, the Louis and Alma Parent House is a fine example of the Craftsman style bungalow. The home embodies typical Craftsman-style features, including an overall low-slung horizontal emphasis, low-pitched roof, widely overhanging eaves, wood shingle siding and wide bargeboards. The interior of the home displays Craftsman-style details such as an inglenook and fireplace with built-ins, mottled green glazed Grueby ceramic tile hearth and a built-in buffet/hutch. The Parent House retains a high degree of exterior and interior architectural integrity and is historically significant for its designation as a single-family residence built in the early 1900s in Spokane.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Patsy Clark Mansion<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1897<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter<br>
Common Name: Patsy Clark Mansion<br>
<br>
Possessing an eclectic mix of styles, this impressive home was built for Spokane mining millionaire, Patrick (Patsy) Clark, and his family.  Kirtland K. Cutter, Spokane’s most prolific and celebrated architect, designed the residence to be the "most luxurious mansion ever" following a directive from the owner.  Cutter traveled around the world, collecting materials and furnishings for the house - the exterior sepia sandstone is from Italy, the brick was made in St. Louis, Missouri and stained-glass windows were made by Louis Comfort Tiffany in New York City.  Clark lived in the mansion until his death in 1915 and his wife, Mary, remained in the house until 1926.  Eugene Enloe, an investor, purchased the house and sold it by 1950.  The mansion served as the Francis Lester Inn, a restaurant and event house until 1982.  It was then restored as Patsy Clark’s Restaurant.  The Patsy Clark mansion went through several owners in the late 20th century.  It is currently the home of the law firm, Eyman, Allison, Fennessy, Hunter and Jones.<br>

Common Name: Charles and Estella Pattullo House<br>
<br>
Built in 1906 and 1907, the Pattullo House is an excellent example of the Craftsman tradition.  The home was designed by the Ballard Plannary Company, a noted early 20th-century Spokane architectural firm, and was constructed by the Chamberlin Real Estate &amp; Improvement Company.  The April 1907 cover of Chamberlin’s promotional publication, &quot;Spokane’s Home Builders,&quot; featured an artist&#39;s rendering of the house.  Pictured in the Ballard Plannary Company’s c. 1910-11 house plan book &quot;The Modern Bungalow,&quot; a photograph of the house was underscored with a caption that described the home as “strictly California in design,” and professed the beautiful residence was admired by scores of people.  The house was built for Estella Pattullo and her husband, Charles F. G. Pattullo, founder, president, and general manager of the Oregon Mortgage Company of Spokane for 43 years. <br>

<b>Title:</b> Paulsen Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1908<br>
Architect: Dow &amp; Hubbell and Gustav A. Pehrson<br>
Common Name: The Paulsen Center<br>
<br>
The Paulsen Center is one of the most prominent features of the Spokane skyline. It consists of two buildings: the August Paulsen Building, designed by architects Dow and Hubbel and built in 1908-1911, and the Paulsen Medical and Dental Building, designed by architect Gustav A. Pehson and built in 1928-29 after Paulsen's death. It is architecturally significant because it used the newest form of all steel construction, which allowed it to be the tallest building in Spokane at that time. It illustrates the early formula for high-rise construction, which divided a building into three parts: a base, a shaft housing identical floors of offices, and an elaborate cornice crowning the composition. The style is generally associated with The Chicago School, referring to the skyscraper movement and the influence of Louis Sullivan. Pehrson designed the fifteen story Medical and Dental Building in the Art Deco style with Spanish and Moorish styled exterior and interior detailing. Its stepped crown rises to a set-back penthouse that members of the Paulsen family have occupied since the building was erected.<br>

Built in 1898, the Peyton Building rose from the ashes of the Great Eastern Building (1890), which suffered a tragic fire that left only the exterior walls intact. Colonel Isaac N. Peyton purchased the property in 1898 and built the Peyton using the remaining walls of the Great Eastern. In 1908, the Peyton Annex at 10 N. Post Street was constructed adjacent (south) of the Peyton Building. At the time, the Annex was only the second reinforced concrete building in Spokane (the Holley-Mason Building was the first). Seven stories, the Annex is characterized by its three classical parts: base, shaft, and capital. Both the Peyton Building and Annex were known as first class commercial locations called the "million-dollar corner."  The Peyton Building and Peyton Annex stand together as one of several remaining large commercial buildings in downtown Spokane designed in the Romanesque revival and Commercial styles.<br>

<br>
The Phillips-Mitchem House was built in 1911 by the Kiernan Land Company and Maxwell Phillips, a real estate agent employed by the Western Trust &amp; Investment Company.  As the Kiernan Land Company developed the South Side Cable Addition on Spokane’s South Hill, Phillips invested in property in the Addition as an independent investor and real estate speculator.  After construction of the Phillips-Mitchem House was complete, Maxwell Phillips and his wife, Ethel Phillips, lived at the residence for a few months then sold it for $12,000 to Henry and Clarissa Mitchem who arrived in Spokane in the early 1870s.  The Phillips-Mitchem House is an outstanding example of eclectic Arts &amp; Crafts-period styling with strong influence from the Tudor Revival and Craftsman traditions.  The Phillips-Mitchem House is a tangible expression of the developer&#39;s intentions for the South Side Cable Addition of the trends, reflecting patterns that led to the adoption of subdivision regulations and covenants in Spokane residential neighborhoods.<br>

Built in 1908, the Pine Creek Dairy Creamery building is a good example of early commercial/industrial brick masonry blocks that were built throughout east downtown Spokane during the early 1900s. A 1909 Spokesman-Review article described The Pine Creek Dairy as the Ňlargest producer of milk in the territory."  The dairy included a rural farm with milking operations that supported 120 cows, and a creamery building at 168 S. Division Street. The creamery building housed the dairy's office, warehouse, distribution sales center, and processing plant, which manufactured cream, butter, and cheese. The dairy was owned and operated by William C. Sohns, who was regarded as one of Spokane's most trusted and influential dairymen.<br>

The most striking feature of the home is its exterior cladding, a decorative veneer of high-quality multi-colored glazed enamel-faced brick that completely covers the first and second floors of the two-story house. Similar in appearance to large glazed ceramic subway tiles, glazed enameled face bricks were sometimes used in Spokane as exterior veneer material on commercial buildings and only rarely on single-family homes, mostly as decorative embellishment at front entrances. The Piollet House may be the only home in Spokane which is entirely clad with decorative enameled face brick. The garage, built in 1928 behind the Piollet House, is made of hollow-core ceramic tile block construction and is covered with a glazed red tile roof. The garage&#39;s hollow-core ceramic tile blocks and glazed ceramic roof tiles, and the home&#39;s enameled face bricks were all made by the Washington Brick, Lime &amp; Sewer Pipe Company which advanced a creative marketing approach in the 1920s when they showcased their products at the Piollet House and garage. A pioneer in the brick and tile business, the Washington Brick, Lime, &amp; Sewer Pipe Company was, at the turn of the 20th-century, one of the first and largest brick manufacturing facilities in the state of Washington, and was in production in the Spokane area for more than 70 years. The company&#39;s marketing approach also included the property&#39;s first owners Jean &amp; Victor Piollet, the sales manager and later, vice-president, of the Washington Brick, Lime &amp; Sewer Pipe Company from 1912 through 1932.<br>

Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Plante's Ferry Park<br>
<br>
Plante's Ferry Park is significant for several reasons. From 1851 to 1876, the park was the site of the first authorized ferry across the Spokane River and was operated by Antoine Plante, a French Canadian voyageur who came overland with the Astor party, settled in Spokane Valley near what is now the town of Millwood in 1849. In 1861, an act was passed authorizing "Antoine Plante his heirs and assigns to establish and keep a ferry across the Spokane River at or near the point where the military road (Mullan Trail) from Fort Walla Walla to Fort Benton crosses said river." Plante's Ferry was also the site of Antoine's first residence in 1849. In 1865, Isaac Kellogg built a bridge here that connected both sides of the river.<br>

Common Name: Edward and Dora Powell House<br>
<br>
The E. L. Powell House was built in 1899 for Edward Louis Powell, Spokane's mayor from 1893-94, and his wife Dora. The Powell House remained in the family after E. L. Powell's death, when his daughter Gerta moved in to the home with her husband James Rigsby. Dora also remained in the house until her death in 1920. In 1954 the house was converted to apartments, but was later converted to a single-family residence. The home represents master architect Loren L. Rand's interpretation of the restrained Queen Anne style of architecture. For the Powells, Rand elaborated on a common Queen Anne form by mixing decorative elements from different subtypes in an elegantly subtle way.<br>

Common Name: J.C. Ralston House<br>
<br>
The Ralston House is historically significant for its association with John C. Ralston, the Spokane civic engineer who designed and built it in 1900. The house reflects the influence of the Tudor Revival style, as interpreted by Ralston. Ralston was employed as the City of Spokane's chief engineer from 1907 to 1910 when he planned and designed more than $8 million worth of municipal improvements in the city, including many miles of pavement and six of the nine concrete arch bridges erected during Spokane's "Golden Age of Bridge Building." His most noteworthy contribution to Spokane is the Monroe Street Bridge, a city landmark completed in 1911 listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The home remained in the Ralston family for 90 years.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Realty Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Albert Held<br>
Common Name: The Delaney<br>
<br>
The Realty Building, erected in 1910 and designed by master architect, Albert Held, was one of the first and tallest skyscrapers built in Spokane.  Towering eight stories above Riverside Avenue, the building also possesses a delicate and decorative sculpted facade which is artfully rendered in smooth, reflective, cream-colored, glazed terra cotta. The building was originally constructed for the Spokane Realty Company, a group of businessmen and city boosters interested in positive planned growth for the region, and the architectural style and materials used reflects their "Pro-Spokane" vision.  It was around this time that new, tall, elegant buildings with exquisite details began to replace the plain, no-frill brick masonry structures which were erected quickly after the Great Fire of 1889.  The Realty Building, in fact, was also praised as being one of the leading fireproof structures in the city.  The Realty Building was home to a variety of businesses and even served as the Spokane Police Department headquarters until eventually becoming the Delaney Apartments in 1971.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Renstrom-Leigh House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1895<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Renstrom-Leigh House<br>
<br>
The Renstrom-Leigh House is a fine example of the Queen Anne style with strong influence from two of the style's subtypes: Free Classic and Spindlework.  Free Classic elements are expressed in the home's corbelled cornices and frieze bands while Spindlework elements are depicted as delicate embellishments found in turned posts and pendant drops.  An unusual design feature unique to the Renstrom-Leigh House is a diagonal box bay located above the wrap-around porch.  One of the first two homes erected in Booge's Addition, the house was built in 1895 for teamster and wholesale grocery porter, Gustaf A. Renstrom, and his wife, Anna.  Four years later Walter E. and Anna King Leigh bought the property.  Leigh, a prominent Spokane citizen and an accomplished attorney, helped start several Spokane law practices and invested in area mining properties.  He was also the owner and president of the Great Northern Land Company.  The Leighs lived in the house for 21 years, during which time they raised six children.  Later owners have discovered cancelled checks, printed stationery, notes, children's books, magazines and a rare collection of love letters hidden under mounds of insulation and loose floorboards in the home's third-floor unfinished attic.  The love letters were addressed to Miss Muriel Leigh, Walter and Anna Leigh's daughter, in 1916 while the family lived at the property.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Review Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1890<br>
Architect: Chauncey B. Seaton<br>
Common Name: Review Building<br>
<br>
The Review Building houses the offices of the Spokesman-Review, Spokane's principal newspaper. One of the tallest buildings in Spokane, its tower is taller than the main roofs of the Paulsen Medical and Dental and Old National Bank buildings. Since its construction, it has been one of the most conspicuous buildings in town, as the architect, Chauncey B. Seaton, designed it to fit the irregular shape of the lot. Seaton came to Spokane in the aftermath of the Spokane Fire in 1889 to help rebuild the city. In 1890, he designed and supervised the construction of the Spokane Exposition Building. Although he designed the Review Building, he left before it was completed. In its early days, the building housed the Hotel Review in the upper floors. It also housed the Spokane Daily Chronicle until the building became too crowded, and the Chronicle moved into its own building in 1921. The Review Building was erected to house the Review, an evening daily paper, which was established by Frank Dallam as a weekly paper in 1883. Its closest competitor was the Spokesman, a democratic paper owned by a group of Spokane businessmen. In 1893, the competition between the two newspapers necessitated a merger if either was to survive. Out of this the Spokane Morning Review was born, under the management of Harvey Scott, H. L. Pittock, Anthony Cannon, and W. H. Cowles. The Panic of 1893 hurt the paper, and Cowles came to Spokane from Chicago to salvage it. He gained total control and created the Spokesman Review. W. H. Cowles was an important and influential businessman in Spokane. He was a founding member of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce, regional director of the Boy Scouts of America, and director for the Associated Press for thirty-three years. Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and William Howard Taft sought his advice. The family still owns and runs the paper and are generous civic benefactors in Spokane.<br>

Common Name: Ridpath Hotel<br>
<br>
One of Spokane's most historically and architecturally significant hostelries, the Ridpath Hotel is located in the center of the city's arts and entertainment district in downtown Spokane. The hotel is comprised of two historic buildings: a tall multi- story, International-style, brick-veneered, steel-reinforced, high-rise tower completed in 1952, and an attached four-story brick masonry construction commercial building built in 1905. The 1952 building is commonly called the Ridpath Hotel "tower" while the attached 1905 building is called the "east wing." Together, the buildings offer more than 300 furnished hotel guest rooms, a lobby and lounge, cocktail and dining rooms, meeting/convention rooms, commercial shop/store space, a drive-in parking lobby, and a below-ground drive-in parking garage for 100 cars. With 13 floors, the Ridpath Hotel tower rises above surrounding commercial buildings and offers some of the finest and most spectacular panoramic views of Spokane and the surrounding landscape. Like so many historic commercial buildings across the country, the hotel's street-level storefront facades were modified in the 1970s-1980s with a compatible- contemporary design.<br>

Built in 1914, the Dr. Charles &amp; Edith Rigg House is a hallmark example of the Dutch Colonial Revival style and a product of master historic Spokane architect, Archibald G. Rigg, brother to Dr. Charles Rigg, for whom the home was designed.  The house was custom-built for Dr. Charles F. Rigg and his wife, Edith Beck Rigg, and was owned by the Rigg family for 35 years from 1914 to 1949. According to his 1928 obituary in the Spokesman-Review newspaper, Dr. Rigg was beloved as &quot;one of the most popular physicians in Spokane&quot; and served an important position with the Spokane Police Department as the department&#39;s surgeon for 15 years until his death. Shortly after it was erected, a photograph of the Rigg House was featured in the October 4, 1914 edition of the Spokesman-Review, which described the home as a New England colonial type with artistic, novel and striking architectural features. The newspaper reported the property had an $8,500 construction cost and was built in the fashionable Rockwood residential district. In 1921, a professional architectural journal, The Architect and Engineer, featured the Rigg House as one of &quot;The Five Most Notable Small Houses in Spokane.&quot;<br>

<b>Title:</b> Robertson and Raznik Buildings<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912-1913 (Robertson) and 1912 (Raznik)<br>
Architect: Cutter &amp; Malmgren (Robertson) and Joseph T. Levesque (Raznik)<br>
Common Name: The Glen Dow Academy, Sons of Norway Building<br>
<br>
The three-story Robertson building, designed by the influential architectural firm of Cutter and Malmgren, was financed by attorney Frederick C. Robertson, a man who has unfortunately been largely forgotten but played a major role in regional history. Between 1899 and 1902, Robertson defended striking union miners in the Coeur d’Alene district after martial law had been declared and hundreds of workers had been incarcerated. Robertson held that the martial law and confinements were unconstitutional; he prevailed and the martial law order was lifted and the miners released. He was also a prominent member of the Democratic Party and ran unsuccessfully for congress in 1908. The upper floors of the building were intended for use by the Odin Hall of Scandinavian Brotherhood, a fraternal lodge. The building’s upper floors continued to be used by fraternal groups becoming occupied by the Sons of Norway in 1942. That group restored the building directly to the west in 1965, for use as a new entrance. Known as the Raznik building, this two-story building possesses a striking facade due to its diminutive size and elegant composition. Designed by Joseph T. Levesque, the Raznik building was constructed for Max Raznik and originally housed Bob's Chili and a tavern. The Sons of Norway relocated in 1978 and subsequently, the F.C. Robertson Building was purchased by the Glen Dow Academy of Hair Design. The commercial storefront level of the building has seen a number of occupants, including a cigar store, taverns, cafes, and a State Liquor Store.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Robinwood Apartments<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1939<br>
Architect: Chester F. Rider<br>
Common Name: Robinwood Apartments<br>
<br>
Built in 1939, the Robinwood Apartments is significant as a fine example of the Tudor Revival style and one of the most remarkably intact apartment residences in Spokane, Washington. The multi-family complex was erected by Chester F. Rider, a noted Spokane builder and real estate developer who founded, owned, and managed the Rider Housing Corporation, and was responsible for the construction of at least six single-family homes and four multi-family apartment complexes on Spokane&#39;s South Hill. During its period of significance from 1939 to 1954, the Robinwood Apartments achieved importance in the area of community planning &amp; development as one of four apartment complexes that was planned, developed, and built by Rider on the hillside area south of Ninth Avenue and along Grand Avenue on Spokane&#39;s South Hill. Associated with prevalent patterns of multi-family residential settlement in Spokane during the 1930s-1940s, the east and west buildings of the Robinwood Apartments, and its terraced inner courtyard design with original brick and basalt rock walls, is architecturally and historically significant.<br>

Common Name: The Rookery<br>
<br>
The Rookery Building was demolished in 2006. No structure has been rebuilt on the site.
Erected in 1933, the Rookery Building was the premier Spokane example of terra cotta artistry employing Art Deco design elements. Designed by Gustav Albin Pehrson, the Rookery was a three-story brick and steel frame structure with a concrete block foundation and flat roof. It was clad in terra cotta from the famed Washington Brick &amp; Lime Co. of Clayton, Washington and its horizontal emphasis and stylistic design elements, including floral patterns, starbursts, chevrons and fans clearly established it as a high style Art Deco building. Located in the heart of the central business district of downtown Spokane, the Rookery was a strategic and viable commercial space for decades.<br>

The property is a significant remnant of Spokane's eastward development, and is associated with the lives of Oliver C. Ross, his brother Andrew Jackson Ross, and Oliver's son, Edward D. Ross, all of whom were instrumental in the commercial and agricultural development of the Spokane Valley and beyond. In 1929, Mary Palmerio converted the house into "Mary's Italian Restaurant," gaining a regional and national reputation that is remembered today. The Ross Place survives as the focal point and main residence of the Ross family. Although family members lived in other residences prior to the construction of the home in 1910, this property is the one most closely associated with them, and stands as a benchmark of the success and local prominence they achieved by the turn of the century.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Roundup Grocery Warehouse<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1948<br>
Architect: Unknown/Roy L. Blair (builder)<br>
Common Name: Thomas Hammer Coffee<br>
<br>
The Roundup Grocery/Thomas Hammer Building, a former rail corridor warehouse, is associated with Spokane's railroad corridor warehouse history. The warehouse building served as a transfer point for materials shipped into Spokane via the Northern Pacific Railroad to serve the market of Spokane and Inland Northwest. Most all of the warehouses in the Pacific Avenue produce district were built at or near the turn of the twentieth century, between 1892 and 1911. The buildings were predominately oriented toward the railroad, the major carrier of goods, with docks along the rail spurs. When these buildings were built they dealt with the massive load-carrying capacity of the rail car on one side and the relatively small capacity of wagons and trucks that were used to distribute the broken-down lots of goods that had been shipped in by rail on the other side.<br>

<br>
Set over 400' up on a basalt outcropping above the Spokane River, the Italianate/Mission style Royal Riblet mansion is a Spokane Valley landmark. The house, state-of-the-arts for its time, was designed by prominent Spokane architect George Keith and built in 1925 for Royal N. Riblet, an inventor and entrepreneur who made a small fortune constructing tramways for booming mining companies in the Inland Northwest. The home was originally accessed via one of Riblet's trams, which ferried passengers to the home's cliff perch from the other side of the Spokane River. In the late 1980s brothers David and Harold Mielke restored the house for use as the headquarters of the Arbor Crest Winery.<br>

Regarded as a social service work pioneer, the Salvation Army constructed its first permanent Spokane headquarters in a three-story red brick building built in 1921. The facility doubled as the Salvation Army's service center and as a single room occupancy hotel known as the Red Shield Hotel. It housed itinerant men and boys for nearly 60 years, and was the site for church services, boys clubs, free health and legal services, and war relief efforts. The Salvation Army building was one of Spokane's longest-running community aid facilities rendering practical help to those in need as advertised in their crusade for "soup, soap, and salvation." The building was designed and built by architect Archibald Rigg and built by general contractor Frederick Phair, two of Spokane's most accomplished building professionals.<br>

Owner H. H. Hutton had this building built in 1909. A fine representative of Spokane's Single Room Occupancy Hotels in the Central Business District, the hotel housed on the upper floors has always been known as the Saranac, although it was also listed under furnished rooms as the Hotel Margurett in the 1910 directory. Early occupants of the commercial spaces included a second hand store in 1909 and Eli Woisnovich grocer in 1914. City Hand Laundry was a fixture in the building during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Other commercial tenants included B. C. Riblet Aerial Tramway during the 1930s, and Herman's Cabinet Shop and North Coast Supply Co. grocers during the 1940s and 1950s. This four-story red brick building has a buff brick facade with terra cotta trim. The upper floors have four window bays with bays of paired 1/1 wood sash windows flanking two bays of single 1/1 wood sash windows. A fire escape runs down the front of the westernmost of the central bays on the top two floors and extends to cover both single bays on the second floor. The ground floor is divided into three storefronts by cast iron piers, now painted green, which also frame the main hotel entrance offset east of center.<br>

The Sarsfield Farmhouse is a product of the American Arts and Crafts aesthetic and is an excellent example of the Craftsman style of architecture.  The home was built for Patrick and Kate Sarsfield, Irish immigrants who established one of the area's first dairies on the acreage surrounding the house in White Bluff Prairie.  Their business was incorporated as the Marigold Dairy but it was locally known as the Sarsfield Dairy.  The house was designed by noted Spokane architect, Isaac J. Galbraith, and built in 1905 by Medical Lake pioneer and skilled stone mason Peter Lefevre.  It is one of the oldest and best-preserved homes in unincorporated Spokane County and conveys early twentieth century building techniques evidenced in the use of basalt "liver rock" applied in the blind mortar method as a ten to twelve inch thick rock veneer.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Schade Brewery<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1902<br>
Architect: Lewis Stritesky and Gustav Pehrson<br>
Common Name: Schade Tower<br>
<br>
The Schade Brewery as it stands today was constructed in four phases: ca. 1902, 1903, 1907 and 1934-37.  A striking landmark, and local manifestation of national trends, the old Schade Brewery provides a prominent physical reminder of past social, industrial, and architectural eras. The building takes its name from Bernhardt Schade, the brewmaster who had the building erected in 1903. Schade served as assistant brewmaster at another Spokane brewery, the New York Brewery, for a decade prior to establishing his own brewing operation. In 1903 he bought the entire oversized city block on East Trent from a Mr. Frost. Included in the purchase was a cold storage building Frost was constructing on the site. Schade hired the architect Lewis Stritesky, designer of the prominent Westminster Apartments at 2301 W. Pacific in Spokane, to design a facility based on drawings of a European brewery. Stritesky created a new western addition for the building begun by Frost. A bottling building and steam/pump house were also built on the property. Initial production was 35,000 to 40,000 barrels a year.<br>

Architect: Sears and Roebuck Company (Class _A_ Store)/NImmons, Carr and Wright<br>
Common Name: Spokane Public Library<br>
<br>
Sears &amp; Roebuck, one of the largest mail-order department stores in the United States, erected this Art-Deco building as the site of their Spokane store in 1929. Sears occupied the building until 1960, when it built a new store at the Northtown Mall. In 1961, the Comstock Foundation purchased the building for $350,000 and donated it to the City of Spokane for use as a new Public Library. A condition of the donation was that the Comstock name be retained. In 1962, the building was remodeled and opened as the Spokane Public Library. The building was razed in 1992 to make way for a new building to house the Spokane Public Library.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Seehorn-Lang Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1896<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Seehorn Storage &amp; Transfer Company<br>
<br>
The Seehorn Storage &amp; Transfer Co. Building is a contributing structure in the West Downtown Spokane Historic Transportation Corridor National Historic District. From 1898-1900 this building served as the warehouse for Swift &amp; Co. meat packers. Prior to that, Spokane Storage Co. occupied the site. Seehorn Storage and Transfer moved into the building around 1910, and remained until about 1925, when the building was remodeled and street-level storefronts were added. Two longtime occupants of the new storefronts were the Holland Furnace Co., at 157-59, and Hoag (later Western) X-ray Co., at 155, both of which moved in during the late 1920s and remained into the 1960s. The building now connects with the old Central Steam Heat Plant, and is a part of Steam Plant Square, a renovated industrial complex housing office and commercial space in a unique setting.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Seligman House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1907<br>
Architect: Kirtland K. Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren<br>
Common Name: William Otto &amp; Stella Seligman House<br>
<br>
Built in 1907, the Seligman House is a fine depiction of the Craftsman style. It was designed by Kirtland Kelsey Cutter, a principal architect with the architectural firm, Cutter &amp; Malmgren. The front page of the Spokesman-Review newspaper printed a lengthy description of the Seligman House along with floor plans, a photograph of the exterior, and a photograph of the living room interior on August 25, 1907. Constructed at a reported cost of $7,000, the property was touted as an attractive home in Manito Park with many distinctive features, including exterior color harmony, large and well-arranged rooms, and ample grounds. The home was built for William Otto Seligman and his wife, Stella May Seligman. W. O. Seligman worked as part-owner/manager of Seligman Brothers Shoe Store in downtown Spokane, and as a salesman for D. Holzman &amp; Company, wholesale liquor and cigars. The property achieved importance from 1906 to 1956 in the areas of significance, architecture and community planning &amp; development, as a fine representation of the Craftsman style and a product of master architect, K. K. Cutter, and as an example of the type of residential home planned and prescribed by the developer of the neighborhood through restrictive covenants.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Sengfelder-Bungay House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1907<br>
Architect: Kirtland Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren<br>
Common Name: Angelica&#39;s Bed &amp; Breakfast<br>
<br>
Designed by the firm of Cutter and Malmgren in 1907 for John Sengfelder, this home is architecturally significant for its association with Spokane's renowned architect, Kirtland Kelsey Cutter. One of the earliest Spokane examples of a custom-designed house with strong Prairie Style elements, the Sengfelder-Bungay House affirms Cutter's design versatility and illustrates his use of stylistic trends. The house is also historically important for its connection with two socially prominent businessmen who were leaders in the commercial development of Spokane, John Sengfelder and Roy Bungay. John Sengfelder, born in Pennsylvania in 1859, migrated west at age 18. Once in Spokane, Sengfelder, practicing his trade as a baker and confectioner, opened the Sengfelder Bakery and Confectionery Company, the largest establishment of its kind in Spokane, which eventually employed over 20 people. His numerous other enterprises included real estate investments. In 1923 he and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Los Angeles. Roy Bungay and his wife purchased the house in 1923 from the Sengfelders. Mr. Bungay helped develop the Spokane International Railway and in 1914, he established, in partnership with John Johnson, the Johnson-Bungay Fuel Company.<br>

<br>
Constructed in 1934, the Sheehy-Kelleher House was built between the 200 and 800 block during the last phase of single-family construction along East Mission Avenue, in what is today identified as the Mission Avenue National Historic District. An excellent example of the Tudor Revival style, the Sheehy-Kelleher House was constructed for John J. Sheehy, chief clerk with the Union Pacific Railway Company, and his wife Jane. Ray and Cathy Kelleher later acquired the property in 1967. During the property's period of significance from 1934 to 1967, the Sheehy-Kelleher House achieved historic significance for its association with the architectural development and settlement of the Logan Neighborhood, specifically along East Mission Avenue, and is additionally architecturally significant as an example of the Tudor Revival style.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Sherwood Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1916<br>
Architect: Cutter &amp; Malmgren/ Hurley-Mason<br>
Common Name: Cutter Building<br>
<br>
Rising eight stories above Riverside Avenue and exquisitely crafted in light gray terra cotta, the Sherwood Building is an eye-catching landmark in downtown Spokane.  Constructed between 1916 and 1917, the building was originally developed by John D. Sherwood, a successful developer in Spokane's early history.  Sherwood employed master architect Kirtland Cutter to design a building that would maximize the economics of the site in the core of a thriving commercial center.  The Sherwood Building is one of only two Gothic Revival buildings in downtown; the other building being the Chronicle Building which was also designed by Cutter.  Characteristic gothic detailing includes the many gargoyles and creatures which adorn the front of the building.  The more interesting carvings included a hooded, bare-legged man who crouches above the main entry way, a lion that sits open-mouthed to his left and an eagle which stares intently from his right.  The skillful use of gothic imagery, repetition and variation of forms and a careful balance of vertical and horizontal elements demonstrates the knowledge and finesse of an architect of the stature of Cutter.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Smith Funeral<br>

Architect: Jones &amp; Levesque<br>
Common Name: North Coast Life Insurance Company<br>
<br>
The Smith Funeral Home Building is one of the focal point structures in the Riverside Avenue National Historic District, a serpentine avenue of stately buildings. The Baroque Revival building was completed in 1912 for Smith and Company, pioneer morticians.  The building was constructured at the considerable cost of $130,000 from plans drawn by Alfred Jones and Joseph Levesque.   The mansard roof, ornamental cartouche placed high on the facade and the original copper marquee gave the funeral home a sense of dignified refinement.  In 1925, the company erected a steel-framed single-story garage entrance at the west of the building. The funeral home was the oldest continuously operating mortuary in the city prior to its closing in the late 1970s.  It then sat vacant for nearly a decade and was very nearly demolished before the North Coast Life Insurance Co., located next east in the former Spokane Elks Lodge, rehabilitated it during the late 1980s.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Solby House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1926<br>
Architect: William Solby and Bertelsen &amp; Wells<br>
Common Name: William and Margaret Solby House<br>
<br>
Built in 1926, the Solby House is a picturesque example of the Tudor Revival &quot;Storybook&quot; style. It was constructed for Margaret Solby and her husband, William Solby, a noted Spokane merchant, artist, inventor, decorator, and interior designer who erected the home to show how a model small house could be built. The home was custom-designed by Solby and Bertelsen &amp; Wells, a prominent Spokane architectural firm, and was built to resemble the &quot;old-fashioned North European type of farm house remembered by Mr. Solby&quot; from his childhood in Copenhagen. With its unique golden-colored false-thatch, rolled-edge roof, hand-troweled soft pink stucco walls, and turquoise blue window shutters, the Solby House was an embodiment of the Storybook-style aesthetic and was described in 1926 as &quot;not like a house in real life, but one of those enchanting hunting lodges in the wood, the cottage where Red Riding Hood went to see her grandmother.&quot; The house was featured with much aplomb on a three-page spread in the Spokesman-Review just after it was built in 1926. The newspaper venerated Solby as a recognized expert on decoration and touted the home&#39;s distinctive old English design with photographs, site plan, floor plan, and numerous articles that described the home&#39;s unique building site, exterior/interior design, architectural features, interior furnishings and fixtures, and its high-tech, thatch-like Zonolite roof. Called &quot;Solby&#39;s Thatch,&quot; the roof was developed by William Solby to specifically resemble the look of thatched roofs constructed on cottages in England and northern Europe. The Solby House was additionally showcased in a May 1927 Good Housekeeping Magazine story with descriptive narrative and photographs of the exterior and interior. <br>

Common Name: Spokane &amp; Inland Empire Railroad Car Facility<br>
<br>
The Spokane &amp; Inland Empire Railroad (SIERR) Facilities and Car Barns constitute the largest and most intact building assemblage arising from the early twentieth century heyday of the electric railroad in the &quot;Inland Empire&quot; of Washington State. Given Spokane&#39;s national prominence in the early development of electric rail systems, these facilities provide a set of valuable resources connected with the transportation history of the United States. Built in a robust but austere variation of the industrial Romanesque Revival style, the SIERR buildings as a whole constitute a rare surviving example of a large scale electric railroad car complex from a century ago, a significant building type in both architectural and engineering terms. The brick and stone building complex features structural clarity and architectural expression in the straightforward materials, repetitive bays and scale of the various rail car barns. The SIERR building complex still stands as a rare surviving representative of an electric railroad car repair, storage, and fabrication facility despite minor alterations.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Spokane City Hall<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Julius Zittel<br>
Common Name: Old City Hall<br>
<br>
This building was erected to serve as the temporary home of City Hall between 1912 and 1913, when railroad construction required demolition of the previous City Hall building.  The City of Spokane expected to occupy this building for no more than five years, so no effort was made on ornamentation; its exterior was plain and its interior designed to be turned into a warehouse if expedient.  Instead, it served as the seat of city government for more than seventy years, and as such was the site of many events that had an important impact on the historic and social fabric of the region.  As a public building in everyday use, the Old City Hall was maintained in good operating condition and was never significantly altered.  It remains much the same as built, a well-preserved legacy of the Commercial Style and Chicago School of architecture, as interpreted by noted local architect Julius Zittel.  This building served as City Hall until 1982, when the city offices were moved into the Montgomery Ward Building at Post Street and Spokane Falls Boulevard.  It has been renovated for office and commercial space.<br>

<br>
The Spokane County Courthouse is one of the more prominent features in the Spokane skyline. It was built during 1894-1895 by David Fotheringham. Architect Willis Ritchie's award-winning design was chosen through a design competition in 1893. The dry pressed brick used for the building was the first to be produced in the area; previously such brick had to be shipped from the East Coast. The building has housed Spokane County government since 1895 and is one of the finest examples of French Renaissance architecture in the West.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Spokane Public Radio<br>
<br>
Spokane Fire Station No. 3, as it exists today, is actually two buildings, each built at a different time and later joined to form a single unit. The rear section, built in 1912, was originally intended to serve as a shop where vehicles and other fire fighting equipment could be built and repaired. At present, this building exhibits a red brick exterior and retains its historic two-story commercial style. The adjoining structure, built in 1917, also maintains a red brick exterior with a concrete foundation and a flat tar roof. The interior of the station, despite renovation to accommodate modern business activities, retains many features reminiscent of its original purpose, including the sliding pole! <br>

Since 1930, Fire Station No. 9 not only provided fire protection for a large part of the city, but was an important factor in the neighborhood's social life as a center for local functions and various services as well. The station is also significant as an illustration of a transitional period in local firehouse design.

<b>Title:</b> Spokane Flour Mill<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1895<br>
Architect: E.P. Allis<br>
Common Name: The Old Flour Mill<br>
<br>
The Flour Mill is a physical reminder of the centrality of water power in Spokane's history; nearly all of the early development of the city was directly related to the majestic falls of the Spokane River. The Spokane Flour Mill, built in 1895, was one in a series of mills built along the falls prior to 1900. It did not come into operation, however, until 1900 because the property became mired in a complex international lawsuit that was one of the most explosive and longest-fought battles in the city's legal history. The mill was adaptively renovated as a shopping center in conjunction with preparations for the World's Fair that Spokane hosted in 1974. Shoppers and diners at the Flour Mill now enjoy a view of Riverfront Park, the legacy of Expo '74 and the centerpiece of the city. The Flour Mill stands as a unique reminder that Spokane's history and wealth began in the power of the falls and endured through the bounty of the surrounding countryside.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Spokane House Site<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: NA<br>
Architect: NA<br>
Common Name: Fort Jacob/ Fort Spokane<br>
<br>
The Spokane House Site is not currently listed on either the Spokane or the National Register of Historic Places, but is considered a historically and culturally significant archaeological site.
At the turn of the century, the North West Company, a Canadian firm, started exploration of the fur resources of the inland northwest. David Thompson, explorer-geographer with the North West Company, made his way across the Rocky Mountains in 1807. As a result of these explorations, the trading posts of Kootenai House, Kullyspell House, and Saleesh House were established. In 1810, Thompson established a small post called Spokane House, built to meet his immediate needs, at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane Rivers. It probably consisted of a store, warehouse, and quarters for the men. In 1811, John Jacob Astor of the American Pacific Fur Company established Fort Jacob near Spokane House. Fort Jacob was short-lived as news of the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain spread. By 1821, in an act of Parliament, the Canadian North West Company was absorbed by the British Hudson's Bay Company. In 1826, Spokane House was considered to be a less than ideal place for a trading post, and after 16 years of continuous occupation was abandoned for Fort Colville. Although archaeological studies have been made of this site, the precise location of Spokane House remains unknown. The Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission has developed a Spokane House site for the enjoyment and education of visitors.<br>

The Spokane Sash &amp; Door Company Flats are historically significant for their association with Spokane&#39;s development and growth as a regional transportation hub, and architecturally significant as the work of the city&#39;s most celebrated architect, Kirtland K. Cutter. Built during a period when Spokane&#39;s population tripled from 36,000 in 1900 to 100,000 in 1910, this building is one of only a few of the twenty-two apartments built in Spokane by 1909 still standing today. The main building was commissioned in Tudor Revival style by the Spokane Sash and Door Company. This clinker brick building rightfully derives its current name, &quot;The Gables,&quot; from the building&#39;s multi-gabled rooflines.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Strahorn Pines (demolished)<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1887<br>
Architect: J.J. Browne; Kirtland K. Cutter &amp; Karl Malmgren (1900 remodel)<br>
Common Name: Strahorn Pines (demolished)<br>
<br>
The historic Strahorn Pines building was purchased by the Eastern Washington Historical Society in 1970, then demolished in 1974 to make way for expanded facilities and more parking. The existing structure at this address (the Museum of Arts and Culture Exhibition building) is not listed on a historic register.
Constructed in 1887, this home was built and occupied by J.J. Browne and his family until 1900 when the house was purchased by Robert E. Strahorn and his wife Carrie Adell "Dell" Strahorn. The three-story building was then completely remodeled by architects K. Cutter and K. Malmgren into a twenty-room mansion with nine bathrooms and ten fireplaces. Said to be the first house in Spokane with steam heat, Strahorn Pines was said to also house a bowling lane. In 1929, the home and coach house were converted into eleven apartments, but a portion of the original decorations and furnishings were retained. First owned by J.J. Browne, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Strahorn purchased the home in 1900. Strahorn had been a writer covering the Sioux Wars in the Powder River Country. Eventually, Jay Gould hired Strahorn to publicize the benefits of the railroads and to promote westward expansion and settlement. Strahorn's booster job evolved into research into the placement of rail extensions. Strahorn was a key figure in the railroad development in Spokane and the Inland Empire. He single-handedly built the North Coast Railway, connecting Spokane with Portland and the coast. After a lifetime of fortunes won and lost, Robert Strahorn died in Spokane in 1944.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Strong House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1879<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: J.F. Strong House<br>
<br>
Built in 1879 and expanded in 1900, the J. F. Strong House is one of the earliest and best preserved homes in North Spokane County. It is historically significant for its association with the first owner, J. F. Strong, the first successful settler in the Five Mile Prairie area. The Strong House was originally located on a 160 acre homestead, and is associated with the early settlement of Five Mile Prairie and the agricultural heritage of the area. It served as the Strong Family home for over thirty years. The Strong House retains a high degree of integrity and is one of the few houses on Five Mile Prairie built before the turn of the century.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Sunset Boulevard Bridge<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Morton McCartney/ J.F. Cunningham (builder)<br>
Common Name: Latah Creek Bridge<br>
<br>
The Latah Creek Bridge, construction of which began in 1911, was Spokane's second monumental concrete arch bridge, spanning 1,070 feet with seven semi-circular arch spans 128 to 150 feet across. While the Monroe Street Bridge consists of a flattened central arch, the Latah Creek Bridge is composed of a series of Roman or semi-circular arches. As is evident in the many similarities between the two bridges, many of the people who were responsible for the design and construction of the Monroe Street Bridge were also responsible for the design and construction of the Latah Creek Bridge. Like the Monroe Street Bridge, the Latah Creek Bridge is an early example within the state of a long-span fixed-end arch. Although the semi-circular arches of the bridge were reminiscent of an earlier age of concrete and masonry arch construction, the steel reinforcement of the concrete structure pointed towards the future in concrete arch design.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1922<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Emil and Martha Swanson House<br>
<br>
Originally located in the East Central neighborhood of Spokane, the Swanson House is an outstanding example of the high-style Craftsman bungalow.  Classic Craftsman design can be seen in the eaves treatment, window composition, front porch and battered wood posts on massive brick piers.  The house was constructed in 1922 for Emil D. Swanson, a superintendent for the White Pine and Sash Company, and his wife, Martha V.
In 2006 the Swanson House was relocated from its original location at 3720 E Second Avenue in Spokane to its current location at 4912 E Ninth Avenue in Spokane Valley.  Due to this loss of integrity of location, the house is not listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Symons Block<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1917<br>
Architect: Rigg &amp; Van Tyne<br>
Common Name: Symons Block<br>
<br>
Built in 1917-1918, the Symons Block is architecturally important because it reflects the attention to style and investment in quality materials and construction that were still attributes of Spokane's commercial architecture following the city's greatest era of expansion and development. The highly-regarded architectural team of Archibald Rigg and Roland Van Tyne, known for several Spokane landmarks, designed it. It is also important for its association with pioneer Spokane business investor Colonel Thomas W. Symons and his son, who helped bring broadcast radio to the Northwest. For many years the home to Spokane's first radio station, the building is historically significant for its association with the development of the area's local and national broadcasting media. An integral part of Spokane's business community, the Symons Building also has street-level spaces that have housed some of Spokane's best-known businesses.<br>

<br>
Reflecting the influence of the popular turn-of-the-century Craftsman style, the Taber-Ott residence is also significant for its historical associations with architect W. W. Hyslop, who practiced in Spokane between ca. 1900 and 1917. The house, completed in 1911, was designed for E. G. Taber, the chief engineer for the Spokane International Railway company from 1907 to 1940. In addition to its association with Taber's significant role in the development of the Inland Empire, the residence is also noted for its associations with Anna Stratton Browne, widow of Spokane founder J. J. Browne and Taber's second wife, and with Margie May Ott, renowned pianist and musical instructor. Franklin and Margie May Ott acquired the home a few years after E. G. Taber's death in 1946, and remained for nearly forty years.<br>

Spokane carpenter and building contractor George W. Taylor constructed the Taylor House in 1905 in the Emerson-Garfield neighborhood in Muzzy&#39;s Addition on real estate speculation. After a short two-year stay, George Taylor and his wife, Annie Taylor, sold the house for $1,400 and moved away from Spokane. The Taylor House was subseqnetly owned by a number of residents representing a variety of specialties, from telephone/telegraph operators, tailors, real estate &amp; insurance agents, waitress and bartender, to clerks, businessmen, teacher/professor, and professional medical technicians. The Taylor House retains excellent architectural integrity in original location, design, materials, workmanship, and association as a Neoclassical-style single-family residence built in Spokane in 1905.<br>

The woodwork and many built-ins and made of the finest quality quarter-sawn oak which, over time, have burnished to a rich dark amber color. The house and garage are products of residential urban growth in Spokane during the early 1900s and of real estate developer Harl J.

<b>Title:</b> Thomas House on Summit<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1907<br>
Architect:Cutter &amp; Malmgren
Common Name: Charles &amp; Elsie Thomas House<br>
<br>

The Thomas House and garage were built in 1907 in the Sherwood Addition neighborhood in northwest Spokane. They are excellent examples of the Mission Revival style and were erected for prominent Spokane physician and surgeon, Dr. Charles Thomas, and his wife, Elsie Thomas. Located on the bluff at Summit Boulevard with a breathtaking view of the meandering Spokane River and timbered hillsides along the river&#39;s west bank, the property was custom-designed by Cutter &amp; Malmgren, one of Spokane&#39;s most celebrated architectural firms. Construction of the Thomas House was foretold in a February 6, 1905 feature in the Spokane-Review newspaper. The article reported that Dr. Thomas and his wife &quot;will build a $30,000 residence of brick and stone, and there will be a large lodge for automobiles.&quot; The article further indicated that Dr. Thomas selected the site not only because of its delightful view, but because of its convenience to St. Luke&#39;s Hospital.  Especially during its period of significance, 1907-1956, the Thomas House achieved historic significance in the context of community design &amp; development as one of the largest homes built in the Sherwood Addition and as a tangible expression of the prominent urban development and settlement that occurred in the area, especially along the bluff&#39;s edge at Summit Boulevard.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Transient Hotel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1904<br>
Architect: C. Ferris White/McVay Builders<br>
Common Name: Minnesota Building<br>
<br>
The Transient Hotel is significant for its association with the unprecedented population and construction booms that occurred in Spokane in the first decade of the twentieth century. During that time investors erected Single Room Occupancy hotels (SRO) on nearly every block of the city's central business district to accommodate the waves of itinerant laborers who flocked to Spokane for jobs in the region's mining, lumber, agricultural, railroad, and other economic sectors. One such investor was William McVay, the contractor who erected the Transient in 1904. McVay worked from plans drawn by architect C. Ferris White. While the Transient reflects the typical SRO in its configuration, with commercial spaces on the ground floor and single room occupancy residential spaces above, it is atypical in its size--most SROs tended to be considerably larger, with three or four stories and a "U" or "W" shaped footprint, making maximum use of all available space.<br>

<br>
The well-preserved Trumbull-White House was built in 1924 and is a quintessential expression of the Colonial Revival style dominant in American residential architecture from 1880 to 1955.  The house was constructed by Spokane contractor George Bottler for Pearl and Willard Trumbull, one of the city's pioneer automobile dealers.  Pearl Trumbull helped establish state and local garden societies and is credited with helping to create the Lilac Parade and naming Spokane the "Lilac City."  The Trumbull-White House was also home to another significant Spokane woman, Dr. Elizabeth White - one of Spokane's first female physicians.  Dr. White was the first female president of the Deaconess Hospital Medical Staff and one of six female doctors practicing in Spokane when she bought the house. A leader in medical and civic affairs, White was active in the Chamber of Commerce, the Social Hygiene Association, and the advisory council for the Spokane Chapter of the Girl Scouts of America.<br>

Built in 1912, the Tuell House is a hallmark example of the Craftsman style bungalow. It was designed by William J.

Featured in several newspaper articles in 1912 and 1913, the house was described as &quot;artistic and beautiful,&quot; built in the California design. Regarded as contemporary and modern for its time, the home was constructed as a &quot;spec house&quot; by Spokane carpenters and building contractors, Thomas &amp; Jordan, and was reported to cost between $5,500 and $8,000. The property was purchased before it was completed by Spokane pharmacist, Frank Tuell and his wife, Maude Tuell, who made it their home for 17 years. During its period of significance from 1912 to 1929, the property achieved importance as a product of accomplished architect, William Ballard, and as an example of the type and quality of dwelling specifically planned and prescribed through neighborhood design covenants for the Cannon Hill Park Addition.<br>

The house is also significant for its association with several prominent Spokane businessmen. The first owner of the home, J. W. Turner, was an early Spokane refrigeration pioneer and merchant. Subsequent owners include Edgar Van Brundt, treasurer for the Washington Brick, Lime, and Sewer Pipe Company, and Peter Murphy who was prominent in the regional livestock industry.<br>

Built in 1916, the Turner House once occupied an entire city block, but now occupies about half of that space, sharing the block with the modern Loganhurst Care Center. The Luther P.

Turner family, early settlers of the Inland Northwest who made their fortune growing wheat on the rolling Palouse hills west of Spokane. Luther and his wife later became prominent Spokane socialites. Following Mr. Turner's death, the building served as a nursing home for elderly residents until its recent closure.<br>

Common Name: U.S. Post Office<br>
<br>
The U.S. Post Office was designed in the office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department by James Knox Taylor in 1906-07, and reflects the prevailing design ideals of that era with its Beaux Arts Classicism and Second Renaissance Revival influences. An addition to the north end of the building, completed in 1941 by the James Leck Co. of Minneapolis, blends seamlessly with the original structure. Plans for the addition were drawn in the office of Louis A. Simon, Supervising Architect for the Federal Works Administration under the direction of W. G. Noll, Chief of Architecture. A two-year $7.7 million renovation of the building was completed in 1993.<br>

This two-story brick Beaux-Arts building features buff-colored brick veneer and a decorative brick sawtooth and terra cotta cornice capped with the initials "UHB" (United Hillyard Bank).  In 1908, the First National Bank built a tall, two-story building that served as one of the banks in Hillyard.  That bank's reign was cut short when it and the State Bank of Hillyard next door were demolished and replaced in 1920 by the current Hillyard Bank Building.  The UHB Building was designed by Spokane architect, Henry Bertelsen, and the original storefront is still largely intact.<br>

<br>
Jack &amp; Dan&#39;s Tavern is one of only a handful of remaining beer parlors in Spokane that have operated continuously as parlors/taverns since the repeal of prohibition in Washington in 1933. Built in 1909, the two-story brick building housed a variety of businesses over the decades including pharmacies, taverns and meat markets.   Between 1915 and 1933, the prohibition years, saloons changed to soft drink establishments and no longer could patrons rest their feet on the brass rail while enjoying a cold one.  Snappy Beer Parlor, which occupied the commercial space in 1934, would become Joey&#39;s Tavern in the 1940s which would, in turn, become Jack &amp; Dan&#39;s.<br>

The Wallace-Lyberger Building was demolished in 2011.
Built in 1905 by Spokane carpenter, David W. Wallace, the Wallace-Lyberger Building was a one-story vernacular commercial block constructed of un-reinforced brick masonry with a flat roof, plain parapet and corbelled brick cornice.  The property was one of the first commercial buildings built in the Hays Park neighborhood along North Crestline Street and symbolizes the importance of the area&#39;s early 20th century development as a mixed-use residential and commercial neighborhood.  The P. A. Lyberger family founded the Bridgeport Grocery &amp; Hardware Store, a family-owned and operated grocery business that occupied the building for 34 years from 1912 to 1946.<br>

The Washington Cracker Co. building was developed by Portland entrepreneur Herman Wittenberg for his rapidly expanding biscuit and candy-making business in 1891. The business left a legacy of buildings on the west coast, including two in Portland that are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is significant for its place in the patterns of local history, and specifically for its association with historic events that had a significant effect on the city. The building is important for its association with the rapidly growing biscuit and candy industry of the late nineteenth century and as a good representation of a vernacular industrial warehouse that embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type that is particularly representative of the buildings for which this historic district is known.<br>

<br>
The Washington Furniture Building is historically significant for its association with the commercial expansion of Spokane's central business district during the unparalleled period of growth in the first decade of the twentieth century. The building's construction in 1909 coincided with increased building activity that resulted in the emergence of the first block of West Main Avenue as a commercial area on the periphery of downtown that accommodated small business enterprises and residential spaces catering to the working class. This particular part of town became home to a community of immigrants from the Balkan countries. The Washington Furniture Company Building's brick facade still reflects its original use and character and contributes to the high degree of integrity that the block as a whole conveys; very few, if any blocks in east downtown Spokane retain such a high concentration of historic buildings.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Washington Post Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1902<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Washington Post Building<br>
<br>
The Washington Post Building is historically significant for its association with Otto Jukeland, a pioneer leader of Spokane&#39;s German immigrant community and co-founder of The Washington Post, the largest Germanic Language newspaper in the Northwest. The building, completed on the eastern edge of Spokane&#39;s Central Business District in the summer of 1903, was the first permanent home of the newspaper. Jukeland arrived in Spokane from Leipzig, Germany in 1886. In February of 1889, he founded The Washington Post, together with fellow immigrant A. M. Armand. First published from Room 22 in the Eagle Block, the newspaper found an eager readership among the city&#39;s growing German community, and Jukeland bought out Armand in 1900. Subscription continued to grow so that by 1910 the newspaper had already outgrown the building, and the presses were moved to the newly completed Germania Building, a larger facility at the corner of Third and Browne designed for Jukeland by the noted architectural firm of Preusse &amp; Zittel. Preusse and Zittel are also thought to have designed the Washington Post Building.<br>

Common Name: Washington Street Bridge<br>
<br>
The historic Washington Street Bridge was demolished. The existing structure at this address is not listed on a historic register.
The Washington Street Bridge was a three spanned reinforced concrete arch constructed in 1908 over the Spokane River. Designed by City Engineer Charles McIntyre and constructed by Wallace-Coates Engineering Company, the bridge was 242 feet long and consisted of three 77 foot flattened ribbed arches. J.B. Strauss of the Strauss Bascule and Concrete Bridge Company of Chicago was the consulting engineer. The Washington Street Bridge was an early example of concrete construction in the state and, when it was listed on the National Register in 1982, was the oldest surviving concrete arch bridge in the state. By January 1983, the bridge was considered unsafe with numerous cracks in the arches and abutments and chipped supports that revealed exposed reinforced steel. The bridge was demolished and replaced in 1983 with the current bridge.<br>

Architect: Lorenzo Boardman<br>
Common Name: Fugazzi<br>
<br>
Completed in 1890, the year after Spokane's Great Fire, the Whitten Block is historically significant for its association with Spokane's emergence as the commercial center and transportation hub of the Inland Northwest. The building is also architecturally significant as an one of a mere handful of buildings that have survived from the rebuilding effort that followed the fire. It is, moreover, the only remaining commercial structure in Spokane designed by architect Lorenzo Boardman. Finally, the building is significant for its association with Spokane pioneers Leyford B. Whitten and Georgia Ballou Whitten. L. B. Whitten came to Spokane as a carpenter, but soon established himself as a successful mining and real estate investor. In 1888 he married Georgia Ballou, one of Spokane's first female physicians. Some of Spokane's best-known businesses got their start in the Whitten Block. Louis Davenport lived in the building, where he had his restaurant before erecting his landmark Davenport Hotel and restaurant across the street, on the opposite corner of the intersection. Spokane's famous Crescent Department Store was another early occupant of the building. The building was recently renovated and, together with the Miller Block, adjacent next west, now houses a luxury hotel, the Lusso.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1916<br>
Architect: Gustav Pehrson and Kirtland K. Cutter<br>
Common Name: Wilbur-Hahn House<br>
<br>
The Wilbur-Hahn House is architecturally significant as an outstanding example of Craftsman style architecture. It was designed in 1916 for Ralston "Jack" Wilbur, a partner and salesman with Hallide Machinery Company, and his wife Sarah E. Smith, the controlling stockholder of the fabulously lucrative Hecla Mining Company. Wilbur commissioned prominent Spokane architect G. A. Pehrson, a personal friend, to design the home. The plans are reported to have been completed in partnership with K. K. Cutter, Spokane's most celebrated architect; Pehrson was employed in Cutter's firm at the time. In addition to its association with the Wilburs, the home is also historically significant as the long-time residence of Rudolph Hahn, a controversial figure in Spokane who lived in the home from 1924 to 1945. Hahn held lavish parties in the home, entertaining noteworthy figures like Lt. J. Doolittle, later leader of the famous Doolittle Raid during World War II. He moved out of the house a few years after his wife committed suicide in it, in the same year he was convicted for illegally performing abortions. He was found murdered in his apartment downtown in the New Madison Hotel the next year.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Willard Hotel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1911<br>
Architect: Arthur Cowley and Archibald Rigg<br>
Common Name: Otis Hotel<br>
<br>
Dr. Joseph Gandy, one of the first residents of Spokane, had this building constructed in 1911. Originally named the Willard Hotel, it was a single-room-occupancy hotel designed to house the burgeoning working class population drawn to Spokane to fill jobs associated with the city's unparalleled decade of growth just after the turn of the twentieth century. SROs were once commonplace in Spokane, but relatively few representative examples remain. The row of SROs including the Willard, along west First Avenue in the heart of the West Downtown Historic Transportation Corridor, represents the best extant concentration of this property type in Spokane. In 1921, Spokane investor Victor Dessert bought the structure and changed its name to the Atlantic Hotel. By 1941, it was called the Milner Hotel, in 1948 it became the Earle Hotel, and in 1956, the Otis. The Otis Hotel still functions as a single-room-occupancy hotel with commercial space on the first floor.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>
Architect: Charles R. Wood<br>
Common Name: Archibald &amp; Eda Witherspoon House<br>
<br>
Perched on the top of a steep north-facing hillside, the Witherspoon House was built in 1912 as a large, imposing two-story home with creme-colored stucco cladding, arched windows, and a green Spanish tile roof. It is a fine example of the Italian Renaissance style. The home was custom-designed for dynamo Spokane business leader, banker, mining man, and attorney, Archibald W. Witherspoon, and his wife, Eda Mauseth Witherspoon, who lived with their three children at the property for 16 years during Witherspoon&#39;s most productive time of life. Prominently identified with the civic, business, and industrial life of Spokane, A. W. Witherspoon founded the law firm of Witherspoon, Witherspoon &amp; Kelley (now Witherspoon, Kelley, Davenport &amp; Toole), and was noted as one of the oldest members of the bar in Spokane during his career. Witherspoon had a great impact on Spokane business, achieving a reputation as an expert on corporate restructuring and reorganization, and was so well-respected by his peers and clients that he served on the boards of more than 75 corporations in the Inland Northwest.<br>

Built in 1908 and 1920 respectively, the Latah School and its attached gymnasium is one of the oldest, largest and best preserved rural brick schoolhouses in the Palouse farming region in southeastern Spokane County. From 1908 to 1958, the schoolhouse symbolized Latah's commitment to education and community development, serving as the area's primary educational structure. Associated with the evolution of public education in Spokane County, the two-story, brick masonry Latah School reflects early 20th-century building practices advocated for schools, including fire-resistant building materials and a preferred schoolhouse design for graded classrooms. Besides providing a public education to children and students from Latah and surrounding communities, the Latah School served as a meeting place for political, religious, benevolent and other civic and social gatherings in the area.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1949<br>
Architect: W. L. Malony<br>

<br>
Completed in 1949, the Marshall Creek Bridge facilitated the crossing of the mainline rail yard and switching center of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railroad (SP&amp;S), Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and Northern Pacific Railroad (NP) at the community of Marshall, Washington. The bridge spanned two tracks of the SP&amp;S, two through tracks and two diverging tracks of the NP, space for two future through tracks, as well as provided a crossing of Marshall Creek. Before construction of the Marshall Creek Bridge, vehicular track crossing involved a circuitous route leading to an inadequate timber bridge over the creek. Although constructed on a Spokane County highway, the Marshall Creek Bridge was a Washington State Department of Highways Project.<br>

The Rosebush House is reminiscent of thatch-roofed cottages found in the countryside of Northern France and the home's unique garage resembles a Medieval-inspired carriage house. Built for Waldo Rosebush, general manager and treasurer of the Inland Empire Paper Company, the Rosebush House and garage were designed by Harold Whitehouse, one of Spokane's most accomplished architects. The English Cottage/Norman vernacular influence is typical of much of Whitehouse's work during the 1920s-1930s, but the design for the Rosebush property is singularly unusual and distinctive.<br>

<br>
The St. Paul Market Building was built in 1905 at the corner of Dean Avenue and Chestnut Street and is one of the last of three commercial buildings built at this intersection in the West Central neighborhood. The property reflects the scale of the neighborhood's early 20th-century development as a commercial node within walking distance of many residential customers. Founded by Julius J. Danielsen, the St. Paul Market was a family-owned and operated butcher shop that occupied the building for roughly 31 years from 1905 to 1936. True to its form as a neighborhood business and gathering point, the Westminster Presbyterian Church was founded in the basement of the building in the spring of 1955. It was renamed to the Dean Avenue Market in the 1950s and remained a retail food business well into the 1960s.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Horse Slaughter Camp<br>
<b>Description:</b> The soberly named Horse Slaughter Camp is a large open space on the south side of the Spokane River near the Idaho border. During the collision between white settlers and native tribes, events occurred in which participants took the law into their own hands and meted out their own versions of justice. After the defeat of the Spokanes, Couer d’Alenes, Yakimas, Palouses and other tribes at the Battle of Four Lakes and the Battle of Spokane Plains, Wright continued to wreak havoc along the Spokane River in an effort to destroy the tribes’ war-making capability. It was here, in September of 1858, that Colonel George Wright killed over 800 horses belonging to a confederation of Plateau Indian tribes. Wright and his men would take two entire days to shoot the horses. Wright then ordered the burning of several storehouses of grain. This cruel act diminished the tribes’ wealth and mobility. Starvation then threatened the confederation that winter and greatly reduced their resistance. This final undertaking led to more whites settling in the territory.<br><br>
Horse Slaughter Camp is located just west of the 2 mile marker on the Centennial Trail (47.689019, -117.072436). A stone marker, erected in 1946 by the Spokane County Pioneer Society, identifies the site.  Although not listed on the National or Spokane Register, the site has been documented and inventoried.<br>

Architect: W. J. Ballard<br><br>
Possessing an almost “storybook” appearance, the Chamberlin House is an excellent example of the Craftsman style in Spokane.  The home’s porch, complete with tapered pillars, are made of smooth, round cobblestone culled from the banks of the Spokane River.  Wide bargeboards and interior woodwork alike are embellished with a whimsical design that depicts the silhouette of a seabird with a long, pointed beak.  The house was designed by W. J. Ballard for Ernest Chamberlin.  Chamberlin was co-founder of the Chamberlin Real Estate &amp; Improvement Company which, during the early 1900s, built over 400 houses throughout the city and helped spur private home ownership in northwest Spokane.<br>

<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1892<br>
Architect: Herman Preusse<br>
<br>
People of the Jewish faith have participated in the social, economic and political life of the Pacific Northwest from the earliest periods of exploration and settlement.  Temple Emanu-El, erected at the corner of Third Avenue and Madison Street, was the first permanent Jewish house of worship in Washington State.  The synagogue, designed by the noted Spokane architect Herman Preusse, was a beautiful wood building with decorative windows, entryways and embellished with a striking "onion dome" on top of its tower.  The building cost about $3,500 to build and was used until a new temple was built at 8th Avenue and Walnut Street in the 1920s.  The original temple remained until 1934.
<br><br>
A marker, erected by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, now sits on the former site of the temple.<br>

<b>Title:</b> North Western Cold Storage Warehouse<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>
Architect: Keith &amp; Whitehouse<br>
Common Name: Cold Storage Warehouse<br>
<br>
Built in 1910, the North Western Cold Storage Warehouse is located within a large concentration of commercial and industrial buildings, like bakeries, creameries and factories, that began developing in east downtown around the turn of the century.  The warehouse is the largest cold storage, industrial building in Spokane&#39;s first refrigerated market district which is comprised of the NW Cold Storage building and the adjoining buildings.  Together they supplied refrigeration storage for Spokane dairy, meats and produce in a time when most people relied on iceboxes to keep food cold.  John H. McAllister, a contractor and investor, commissioned the noted Spokane architectural firm of Keith &amp; Whitehouse to design the large three-story, brick warehouse.  The large block letters painted on the outside of the building made it clear what the building&#39;s purpose was.  Beginning in 1965 with the Sylvan Furniture Company, the warehouse was cleared of all refrigeration machinery and was never again used for refrigerating, freezing and storing food products.<br>

These universal classical traits are combined with other ornamentation that give the building a distinctly Inland Empire feeling through the use of motifs based on local products and activities, such as the pine cone, apple and wheat sheaves designs and in the use of the war bonneted Indian heads.  Originally home to the Spokane Chamber of Commerce, the building housed numerous organizations and civic groups throughout the years including the Spokane News Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Spokane office and the Spokane Agricultural Expo.  The Spokane Area Chamber of Commerce moved to a larger building at 801 W. Riverside in 2003 and the building is now primarily occupied by the Empire Health Foundation.<br>

Consisting of stucco walls, red tile roof and arcaded entry, Hutton is the only Spokane school that is built in this architectural style.  Designed by master architect, Archibald G. Rigg, and his partner, Roland Van Tyne, the school building rises prominently on an elevated basalt and earthen platform, making it a South Hill Landmark.  Named after mining millionaire and public benefactor, Levi H. Hutton, the school has been serving the children of Spokane for almost 100 years.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Lowell School<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1899, 1917 <br>Architect: Albert Held, C. Harvey Smith<br><br>Located in the center of Latah Valley in southwest Spokane, the Lowell School was originally built in 1899 and enlarged/remodeled in 1917 to accommodate an increased student population growth.  However, little remains of the 1899 structure except the basement and foundation.  Designed by prominent Spokane architects, Albert Held (1899) and C. Harvey Smith (1917), the stucco-clad schoolhouse is a one story Mission Revival building with a low-pitched hip roof, wide overhanging eaves and arched windows.  Named in honor of James Russell Lowell, a noted American educator, philosopher and poet, the building remained a public school until 1954 when it was converted to storage space and then a private residence.  The building is currently undergoing restoration work to not only restore the architecture but to convert it to a restaurant.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Manito Park<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1904<br>Landscape Architect: Olmsted Brothers, Harold T. Abbott, Nagado Sakuri<br>Architect: Chester A. Houghtaling<br><br>Used as a park as early as 1886, by 1891, when the City of Spokane began formally accepting donations of land for public parks, "Montrose Park," as it was originally called, was an established recreational area. Renamed "Manito" in 1903, the park was officially dedicated to the city in 1904 and became the public space cherished today. An evolving landscape, Manito Park has remained Spokane's primary community park since its inception and helps tell the story of recreation, culture, politics and landscape architecture in Spokane. This history is seen and experienced in the basalt-rubble structures, remnants of trolley lines, water features, exceptional flower gardens, such as the Formal Rose Garden and Duncan Gardens, and in the ever-serene Nishinomiya Tsutakawa Japanese Gardens. Truly a jewel of the city, Manito Park and Boulevard has provided recreational and cultural delight for over 100 years.<br><br>

Manito Park and Boulevard's nomination to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places is currently pending.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Rombeck-Dutch's Loans Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1927, ~1903<br>Builder: F.E. Martin<br>Common Name: Huppin's Building<br><br>The Rombeck-Dutch's Loan Building consists of two adjacent buildings that were combined into one ownership in 1986:  a two-story, brick vernacular commercial Single Room Occupancy Hotel, the Rombeck, which was built by Henry Rombeck in 1927, and the one-story, brick vernacular commercial building, which was built around 1903 and operated as Dutch's Loans, immediately to the east.  The Rombeck, accentuated by Classical elemetns, appears to have been the last SRO constructed in downtown Spokane.  Dutch's Loans was built by Ernest Azzi during Spokane's most significant period of growth, 1900-1910,  and remains an integral element of a bock that contains three of the earliest of Spokane's post-fire buildings.  The Rombeck-Dutch's Loans Building continued a legacy of pawn, jewelry, second hand and loan businesses on West Main, most owned and operated by Jewish businessmen who would become prominent families in Spokane's downtown core.  <br>

<b>Title:</b> Hutsinpiller House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1926 <br><br>The Hutsinpiller House and Garage are significant for their fine, artistic representation of the Craftsman style and bungalow house form and are remarkably intact and meticulously preserved. With horizontal emphasis produced by a low-pitched roof, clipped jerkinhead gable peaks, widely overhanging eaves, tapered porch pillars, raked brick cladding with deeply incised shadowed grout lines, the property has a ground-hugging, low-slung form — all tenets of the Craftsman style and the bungalow house form. The home’s interior lends further architectural significance to the property with smooth, well-preserved, superior quality woodwork made of gumwood, a rare specialty hardwood. The home was custom-built for United States Railway Mail Service clerk, J. Elmer Hutsinpiller, and his wife, Hester M. Hutsinpiller. Three generations of the Hutsinpiller family owned the property for more than 70 consecutive years — a strong testament to the well-designed, well-built Hutsinpiller House and the longstanding popularity of the surrounding residential Cannon Hill-Manito Park neighborhood.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Jimmie Durkin Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1903, 1910<br><br>The Jimmie Durkin Building consists of two adjacent buildings that have been combined into one ownership sometime prior to 1948: a three story, brick vernacular commercial Single Room Occupancy hotel built in 1910 and the one story, stucco-clad vernacular commercial building, which was built in 1903, to the east. Both buildings were constructed during Spokane’s most significant period of growth, 1900 through 1910, and remain integral elements of a block that contains three of the earliest of Spokane’s post-fire buildings. The three story building housed the saloon of the Inland Empire’s leading liquor dealer and one of the most colorful characters in Spokane’s early history, Jimmie Durkin. Durkin’s saloon operated into the advent of Prohibition in Washington State, 1916, survived and plodded on after its repeal in 1933. Becoming Dutch’s Loans in the late 1990s, the buildings continued a legacy of pawn, jewelry, second hand and loan businesses on West Main, most owned and operated by Jewish businessmen who would become prominent families in Spokane’s downtown core.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Eikenbary-Pierce House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1910<br>Builder: Anton Isakson<br><br>
The Eikenbary-Pierce House was built in 1910, a block east of Cliff Park in the architecturally prominent historic neighborhood on the South Hill.  Arts &amp; Crafts in style, the home possesses beautiful and stylistic Craftsman features such as the low-pitched roof, tapered porch pillars, overhanging eaves and incredible interior woodwork.  Additionally, a very interesting piece of the history of this Arts and Crafts home is its connection to the founders of Shriner&#39;s Hospital. The building is significant for its association with Henry A. Pierce and Dr. Charles F. Eikenbary, two of Spokane’s most prominent civic benefactors and philanthropists, and the property’s most significant owners. Henry A. Pierce helped organize the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children (as it was then called) in Spokane and served as Chairman of the Board of Governors for the hospital for 35 years from its inception in 1924 to his death in 1959. Pierce hired Dr. Charles Eikenbary as the first orthopedic surgeon and Medical Chief-of-Staff for the Shriners Hospital (1924-1926) and who lived in the house from 1913 to 1923.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Vinther and Nelson Hardware Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1905<br>Architect: Isaac Galbraith<br>Common Name: The Hub<br><br>
Built in 1905, the Vinther and Nelson Hardware Building was designed by Isaac Galbraith, an architect who practiced in Spokane in the first decade of the 20th Century. It is a good, although deteriorated, example of the brick commercial style that became the dominant architectural idiom in early urban America, especially after fire had ravaged many wood frame structures. Although portions of the front facade of the building have been altered, distinctive historic features remain, such as the detailed bas relief ornamentation. The building was built by two enterprising cousins from Denmark, Samuel Vinther and Nels Nelson, who began their careers in the Pacific Northwest in 1982 as common laborers for the railroads. In little over a decade, they were able to create and maintain a successful hardware store which was managed by their sons until 1963. The Vinther and Nelson Hardware Building is significant for its architecture, its story and its contributions to the economy of Spokane especially as it developed on the north side of the Spokane River, made possible by new bridges and the new street railroad system. The story of two humble immigrants making a go at it, and finding financial success in an environment of bustling commercial activity, surviving even the major mid-century economic downturns, is riveting. The tale of Samuel Vinther and Nels Nelson is a leitmotif of the story of early Spokane.<br>

The William O. Bradly House, located on a the lovely, tree-lined Ninth Avenue, is a fine representation of the Mission Revival style and is an exemplary product of master Spokane builder, Aaron L. Lundquist. Its high artistic values are expressed in multiple shaped parapets, characteristics of the Mission Revival style, and in interior woodwork crafted in curly fir and finished the deepest ebony hue. The house was named for Dr. Bradley, a dentist who practiced in Spokane for 58 years and was the property's first and most prominent owner. The home is a contributing resource in the Ninth Avenue National Register Historic District, which was listed in 1994, and retains a high degree of integrity.<br>

Construction of the Plummer-Wheeler House began in 1912 and was completed in 1913. The Plummer-Wheeler House is an excellent rendition of the American Foursquare house form. The home was built for $20,000 - eclipsing by nearly four times the minimum building cost required by neighborhood covenants. The Plummer-Wheeler House is a product of two of Spokane’s most prominent Spokane construction professionals, architect Earl W. Morrison and building contractor Amil T. Johnson. During its period of significance from 1912 to 1951, the Plummer-Wheeler House achieved historical significance for its associations with Spokane attorney William H. Plummer and Spokane surgeon Dr. Herbert E. Wheeler, the home’s two earliest and most significant residents.<br>

Located in the Cannon Hill Park neighborhood, the Love House is a picture perfect example of Craftsman design. Built in 1912 as a part of a South Hill housing development, this home has experienced few changes over the decades. The Love House features a recognizable tapered chimney, spacious front porch, and rough textured brick and basalt rock on the exterior of the home as well as extensive interior oak wood work. Henry Love and his wife Frances were the first owners of the home. Henry was employed by a local loan company before starting and managing his own real estate business in Spokane. After the Loves sold the house in 1917, the property was home to many families with the current residents owning the home since 1994.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Treaty Tree<br>
<b>Description:</b> Located in an area traditionally utilized by the Upper Spokane Indians, the Treaty Tree acted as a meeting and gathering place for tribe members. This tall Ponderosa Pine is named for the discussion that is said to have taken place in the shade of its limbs about the demands for peace from Col. George Wright in 1858. The land on which the tree sits was later granted to Baptiste Peone under the Donation Land Act of 1850. Peone, half white and half Indian, was the only person in the county to receive land under this Act. The noble Treaty Tree stands alone on a low hill as the only evidence remaining of Peone's homestead and the original Saint Michael Mission, also located on this land. <p></p>

The Treaty Tree is not listed on the Spokane Heritage Tree Register but was included in the 1997 Historic Resources Inventory of Spokane County.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Munroe &amp; Helen Burr House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1912<br>Builder: Allister Mack Laing<br><br>The Munroe &amp; Helen Burr House, constructed in 1912, is a textbook example of a Craftsman style home. Located in the Rockwood neighborhood on Spokane’s South Hill, the home was occupied by the Burrs until it was sold in 1916. Munroe Burr was a long time resident of Spokane and operated his own electric company for many years. The low roof line, noticeable “eyebrow” dormer and wide eaves combine to create an exaggerated horizontal appearance – a hallmark of the Craftsman style.  Interior woodwork is prominently expressed in deep ebony-colored curly- and vertical-grain fir, hand-rubbed to a rich patina. The unique basalt rock retaining wall bordering the driveway on the west side of the house was built at the same time as the home making it an original feature of the property. Well-preserved, the Burr House retains a high degree of exterior and interior architectural integrity in original location, design, materials, craftsmanship, and association.

<b>Title:</b> Farline House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1953<br>
Architect: Frank Toribara<br>
Common Name: Louis and Ruth Farline House<br><br>
The Farline House, located just north of Lincoln Park, sits in a neighborhood of relatively modern homes just east of the edge of the older South Central neighborhood. The home is located on a corrner lot and sits canted, with the front elevation faces to the southwest. Designed by Frank Yoshio Toribara, a Seattle-educated architect who moved to Spokane in the 1950s, and built by the Vines Construction Company, this ranch style home contains many unique features and stands out in comparison to the surrounding homes. The eye catching roof line and prominent use of windows are easily seen from the exterior while the interior of the home holds many other distinguishing aspects. The home was occupied by Louis and Ruth Farline from shortly after the time of its construction until 2014, when the home was purchased by the current owners. <br>

<b>Title:</b> Doran Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Doran Building was constructed in 1920, when the age of the automobile was just dawning in earnest. It was designed by early Spokane architect Arthur Cowley and constructed by builder, Abe Houle. The building originally housed one of the earliest and most successful automobile dealerships in Spokane, owned by John Doran. After Doran's death, the building served as a car dealership for various businesses until the 1970's. The following decades saw the building occupied by auto repair shops until it was converted to the Evergreen Parking Garage in 2002. Although the building has experienced many modifications, the front facade maintains the original openings and much of the original appearance of the building. The Doran Building was listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places on 11/07/2016 due to its contribution to local Spokane history. <br>

<b>Title:</b> Wells Chevrolet Service Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> Date Built: 1926<br>
Architect: Unknown<br>
Common Name: Lambert Candy Building<br>
<br>
Historically significant for its association with Spokane's first "auto row," this building was constructed as the service department for Wells Chevrolet, located directly to the north. With the completion of this building in 1926, it became possible to unload automobiles at the railroad grade level and convey them directly to the showroom on First Avenue. After the demise of Wells Chevrolet during the Depression, the building continued to house auto-related businesses, including Better Chevrolet Service, Day-Majer Used Cars and Service, and Riegel Bros./Riegel-Becker Truck, Service, and Body/Paint Shop. By the mid-1960s however, auto row had moved south, and the building was occupied by a tobacco wholesaler and a candy wholesaler. The building stood vacant through the early 1990s. It was recently converted into condominiums.<br>

While modest in design and style, the simple brick building nonetheless helps document the evolution of the automobile and businesses in Spokane.  The 1920s were the first years in which buildings were built downtown specifically to house and sell automobiles and accessories.  The Northwest Transport Truck Company had a showroom and garage facility to service the many trucks that worked the streets of Spokane and the fields of the Inland Northwest farm county.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Wallmark House<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Wallmark House, built in 1963, stands out as one of the premier Mid-Century Modern residences in Spokane County, among many such buildings in an area that was an epi-center of such experimentation. With its shallow-pitched roof, widely-overhanging eaves, massive brick chimney, attached garage, and fixed wood sash windows, it is a classic example of the Contemporary Ranch Style. It was designed by Moritz Kundig, who is among a plethora of Mid-Century modern architects who called Spokane home. The home was built for C. Leonard and Mable Wallmark and has remained in the family since the time of construction. Located on a high bluff overlooking Long Lake (formerly called "Lake Spokane") in the northwest reaches of Spokane County in Nine Mile Falls, the house is an excellent and highly intact example of modern architecture. The Wallmark House was listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places on 11/29/2016.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Manito Methodist Episcopal Church<br>
<b>Description:</b> Built in 1923, and modified in 1959 with the addition of an “educational” wing, Manito Methodist Episcopal Church is a fine example of Italian Renaissance-style influence, and features arched leaded stained-glass windows, red brick cladding with decorative brick patterns, ornamental concrete bas relief sculpture, and a prominent 60-foot-tall square bell tower.  According to church archives, the design and materials for the tower at Manito Methodist Episcopal Church were greatly influenced by one of the great historic basilicas in Italy—St. Francis Basilica of Assisi, Umbria, built in the 1200s. In contrast to the 1923 church, the 1959 education addition depicts hallmark characteristics of Mid-Century Modern-style influence with a low-pitched roof, brushed aluminum window frames, horizontal rows of windows with modern designs, and horizontal rows of decorative blue/green-colored ceramic-clad metal wall panels.  Both the church and the addition were designed by prominent Spokane architects, Kirtland K. Cutter and George M. Rasque respectively. 
The Manito Methodist Episcopal Church was listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Place on 12/12/2016.

<b>Title:</b> Trogdon House<br>
<b>Description:</b> Located in Spokane’s architecturally prominent Rockwood National Register Historic District, the William &amp; Dorothy Trogdon House was listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places under Category C for its architectural significance. The property’s area of significance is “architecture,” and its period of significance is 1963, the year the home was constructed. The Trogdon House conveys characteristics of the modern mid-20th century Northwest Regional style through the home’s natural forested site, massive geometric volume, minimal ornamentation, concrete and wood construction, exposed wood structural members, widely overhanging open eaves, open floor plan, open-tread stairs, vaulted ceiling, and window walls that offer broad views of the property’s forested hillside and help integrate the home with its natural surroundings. Further architecturally significant, the Trogdon House is a product of husband-and-wife master architects, William &amp; Dorothy Trogdon, two of Spokane’s most successful design leaders in commercial and domestic architecture from 1953 to 1985. In Spokane, they were honored with several design awards, and founded various architectural firms that grew and matured to successfully larger firms. Together, William &amp; Dorothy Trogdon custom-designed and built the Trogdon House as their personal residence.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Franklin Elementary School<br>
<b>Description:</b> Franklin Elementary School is historically significant under Criterion “A” for its direct contribution to the broad pattern of educational development in Spokane. The 1909 building represents a second phase of school construction in the city and was one of the structures built as part of a quarter-million dollar effort to modernize the school system just after the turn of the 20th century. A later addition in the early 1950s shows how the district adapted to the post-WWII baby boom and the changing needs of its students, teachers and administrators. Today
the original building and addition continues to serve their originally intended purpose and both retain a high level of integrity.
Franklin Elementary is also eligible under Criterion C as a resource that embodies the distinguishing characteristics of its type and period of construction. Stylistically the school represents a shift from the grand Romanesque Revival structures with bell towers of the 1880s, to the more restrained classical traditions of broken cornices, flat roofs and symmetry of the turn-of-the-century. The school is an outstanding example of early public school architecture in Spokane and is one of a few standing elementary school structures from a second wave of school construction in the city. The school also represents the work of noted Spokane architect, Loren L. Rand whose career spanned more than 30 years.<br>

<b>Title:</b> McKinley School<br>
<b>Description:</b> Built in 1902, and enlarged in 1903, the McKinley School is an example of the Neoclassical style. The 2.5-story building is embellished with a formal symmetrical design, broad wall expanses of crème-colored face brick cladding, contrasting red brick quoins and red brick window arches, a hipped roof with hipped and gabled dormers, a combination of original arched and rectangular windows, decorative architectural details made of cast-concrete, and an elaborate formal front entrance. Partially recessed at the first floor, the full-height formal front entrance bay is articulated with Neoclassical-style details, including narrow fluted engaged pilasters with decorative Ionic capitals, a custom-designed cast-concrete entablature, a row of round arched windows with radiating brick voussoirs, and a decorative cast-concrete name plate, which spells McKINLEY SCHOOL. Located in a mixed-use commercial, industrial, and residential area in Spokane, Washington’s East Central neighborhood, McKinley School is remarkably well-preserved and retains excellent integrity in original location, design, materials, workmanship, and association. It was last used as an elementary school in the 1961-1962 school years.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Spokane Continental Bakery Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Spokane-Continental Bakery Building is a well-preserved example of the
industrial/commercial warehouse building type constructed during the first half of the
20th-century. Construction of the building began in 1909, and grew as various additions
and modifications were undertaken in 1917,1920,1947,and 1956.The large 49,000-
square-foot bakery warehouse is a multi-level, reinforced red brick masonry
construction structure that extends through the entire blockfront along Broadway Avenue
between Lincoln and Post Streets. Located a few hundred yards north of the Spokane
River in an industrial/commercial section of Spokane, Washington, the warehouse
building features a symmetrical pattern of tall windows that offer narrow between-building-
views of the Spokane River. Common to most early 20th-century
industrial/commercial warehouses, the bakery building’s exterior and interior are plain
with little articulation or embellishment, and reveal common-bond brick masonry, an
open and spacious interior with a combination of concrete-brick-wood plank floors,
exposed brick masonry perimeter walls, high ceilings of 12 feet or more, and exposed
structural posts and beams made of wood, concrete, and steel. Even with various exterior
window and warehouse delivery door modifications during the past century, the Spokane-
Continental Bakery Building retains good to excellent integrity in original location, design, materials, workmanship, and association.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Hobson Building<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Hobson Building is a two-story brick vernacular warehouse on the south side of Railroad Avenue between Jefferson and Adams streets in west downtown Spokane. Built in 1908 for the George H. Gallagher Co., the 60' x 120' building retains its basic form and openings with its primary facade facing north along the railroad. The building is an addition to the west end of a similar two-story brick warehouse that was built in 1906, also by the George H. Gallagher Co.
<br><br>
Resting on basalt rubble basement walls, the unreinforced red brick structure is supported by a wood post and beam structure and topped by a flat roof. The front façade (north) is divided into three bays within a flat brick wall terminated by a brick corbel cornice. Accessed from a raised concrete loading dock, a centered, segmental arch loading bay with large wood doors dominates the first floor. A second floor loading bay door is directly above. Segmental arch window bays flank the loading bays on both floors. The building demonstrates the adaptation from the at grade loading dock to the second story loading platform/bridge after completion of the viaduct in 1916 (1916 concrete bridge removed).
<br><br>
The interior retains the character of the original warehouse, wood plank floors, basalt basement, brick first and second story walls, wood post and beam structure, and exposed wood joists and rafters.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Cooper-George Apartments &amp; Garage<br>
<b>Description:</b> Erected in 1952, the Cooper-George Apartments and Garage is an excellent example of its type—a modern reinforced-concrete, multi-storied, multi-family commercial apartment building and parking garage. The Cooper-George Apartments and Garage are surrounded by a busy hospital/medical center on the South Hill, one mile uphill from downtown Spokane. The 13-floor apartment building is tall, soaring 130 feet in height from a steep hillside, and reveals stylistic influence from the International tradition, a mid-century modern style popular from 1925 to 1965. The building’s International-Style influence is well-displayed by its boxy geometric shape, flat roof, sleek concrete exterior walls, minimal decorative ornamentation, and symmetrically placed vertical bands of windows. Located just west of the apartment building, the two-story Cooper-George Garage was also built in 1952 as part of the apartment complex. The parking garage mimics the boxy shape, flat roof, and smooth concrete cladding of the apartment building. In excellent condition, the Cooper-George Apartments and Garage retain a high degree of exterior integrity in original location, design, materials, workmanship, and association. In 2018, the building received a full rehabilitation as a market-rate apartment building.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Engelhorn Hotel<br>
<b>Description:</b> Rising from an elevated basalt rubble and brick basement, the Danmor is a three-story unreinforced brick apartment building. Built in 1907, as the Engelhorn Hotel, the building is midblock along the north side of Third Avenue between Stevens and Washington streets. The front façade is symmetrically-arranged and divided into three bays: a central first floor entry bay and flanking single window bays. The window bays of the second and third stories are aligned over the first floor bays. Horizontal rusticated brick courses divide the façade into four divisions: basement, first floor, second floor, and third floor. A relatively simple corbeled cornice with corner posts completes the building.<br>

<b>Title:</b> McAllen Farmhouse<br>
<b>Description:</b> In 1890, George &amp; Rosa McAllen began homesteading 160 acres on Paradise Prairie, and seven years later in 1897, were awarded a USA Patent Warranty Deed for “proving” their homestead land with farming and ranching operations. In 1900, George McAllen increased his land holdings to 315 acres, and six years later in 1906, built the McAllen Farmhouse. A fine representation of the Folk Victorian style and the style’s stepped front-gable-and-wing design, the McAllen Farmhouse survives as one of the few historic homes built at the turn of the 20th century in the early 1900s on Paradise Prairie. Although the farmhouse was moved in 2005 a quarter mile south to its present site, it retains a high degree of exterior integrity in original design, materials, workmanship, and association.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Mount Spokane Vista House<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Vista House sits at the summit of Mount Spokane within Mount Spokane State Park. The park encompasses nearly 14,000 acres, and is the largest in the Washington State Park system. The summit at this location has an elevation of approximately 5,800 feet and is the highest point in the region. This location provides sweeping views of the surrounding areas, particularly to the east and south. The relatively open landscapes on these sides give distant views, while the views to the north and west sides of the building are partially obscured by the surrounding high alpine forest. The building serves multiple functions for the visiting public. At the exterior, the building features an integrated terrace on the east side to provide a defined space for taking in the magnificent views. The large east side terrace continues around the perimeter of the building in the form of a wide sidewalk. At the interior, there are four main areas: the public gathering room, the former store room, toilet rooms, and a former fire lookout room on the upper floor. <br>

<b>Title:</b> Trade Winds Motel<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Trade Winds Motel is located at 907 W. 3rd Avenue, in central Spokane directly north of the I-90 freeway. It is situated on the southwest corner where W. 3rd intersects S. Lincoln Street. The plan of the 4-story building is a graceful curve, with rows of rooms with balconies which face an inner court. It was designed in 1962 by Donald E. Neraas, a prolific local architect who was noted for his many Mid-Century Modern designs for buildings throughout the Pacific Northwest. The building displays characteristics of the International Style, with its horizontal bands of compartmentalized units. It is significant for its association with the flourishing of Mid-Century Modern architecture experienced in Spokane in the 1950s and 1960s.<br>

<b>Title:</b> The Spokane Ponderosa<br>
<b>Description:</b> Species: Ponderosa Pine<br><br>Smelling of vanilla and growing nearly 200 feet tall, the Ponderosa Pine has become a local icon and is, in fact, the official tree of the City of Spokane.  This towering Ponderosa is found in the Browne's Addition Historic District and is the largest in the city!  **A sad update on the Spokane Ponderosa** - a strong rain and subsequent windstorm loosened the tree's roots so much that it fell and was lost on 5/19/19.<br>
