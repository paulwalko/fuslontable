<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Hand held electronics, wall mounted TV,  RIB dinghy and outboard, cash, alcohol, dive gear, passports<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A US flagged sailing yacht with the owner/captain and 1 Canadian crew member onboard departed Puerto Cortez for Roatan.  After 10 hours of sailing in strong easterlies and current they had made 13 miles of easting and were 5 miles off the coast.
 
At sunset they were approached and boarded from the west by a panga with 8 men onboard, with weapons drawn. The two pirates armed with semiautomatic guns immediately took control of the captain, who quickly made it clear he would comply with their wishes. Two men remained in the panga, while the 4 remaining pirates began pilfering the boat, roughing up the female crew member as she retrieved the demanded cash.  During the 15 minutes they were ransacking the yacht the pirates took hand held electronics, a wall mounted TV, cash, alcohol, dive gear, and passports, as well as the RIB dinghy/outboard which was launched off the deck. The pirates departed to retrieve the dinghy and the yacht continued onward to Roatan.  The captain believes his compliant and non-threatening posture prevented injury or worse.

After a difficult night with limited navigation and communications capability their radio call was answered by a US Navy surveillance airplane, that then overflew them and arranged for continued airborne escort to Roatan. The US Navy had arranged a warm welcome and official reports were made to the police, port captain and Honduran coast guard. The supporting consulates provided additional assistance with communications and passport replacement.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing vessel departed the Rio Dulce, Guatemala intending to visit Utila, Honduras. They were motor sailing in light winds and at 8:00 AM, they were about 10 miles off the coast and were boarded by pirates. 4 men boarded (2 armed with handguns) and 1 remained in the open fishing boat. 

The pirates were very aggressive, and fired their guns several times very close to the heads of the crew to ensure compliance. The crew spoke French and pretended not to “understand” while the boat was ransacked for about 1 hour. 

The pirates took everything they could, while taking no precautions to conceal their identities. Once satisfied with their haul they departed in the direction of the Honduran coast. 

There were no injuries to the crew. The yacht was able to make radio contact with the Puerto Cortes naval base and routed there to make reports to the Coast Guard, Police and Port Captain.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Assault<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash and mobile phones, dinghy<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Guests onboard a chartered catamaran on an SMMA mooring in Soufriere, St. Lucia, were awakened at 0130 am when they were boarded by 4 men. 2 of the men were armed with guns, and 1 with a knife, all had their faces concealed. 

Three of the men damaged a deck hatch to break into the locked yacht while the fourth cut the davit lines on the dinghy during this violent boarding. There were 6 members in the charter group, 2 families each with a teenage daughter. The women and children quickly locked themselves inside a cabin. There were many threats and a short struggle. One victim was hit in the face with a gun, the other hit on the head. The boarders demanded cash, cellphones and passports. The cash and cellphones were surrendered readily and the passports and access to the locked cabin refused. After 20 terrifying minutes of further threats of violence and death the 4 men left with the dinghy. 

Reports were made to the charter base and police. The police took NO forensic evidence and told the victims and the charter company that they did “not want any media involved as it might scare tourists”. The charter company has assisted the victims with communications and arranged for a local media outlet to film an interview, which has not been broadcast. The dinghy was abandoned ashore and later recovered. 

The police have since asked for some details about the stolen cellphones by email, but have not informed the victims of any arrests in this matter. The victims describe this as a “violent, aggressive and prolonged attack that left their families traumatized” and point out that at no point during the charter briefing were they informed of any “no go” or problem areas. They were advised to use the cable and lock provided to secure the dinghy when ashore.  

CSSN NOTE: As a matter of policy CSSN will publish updates if police confirm to the victims that there has been significant progress in this matter.<br>

<b>Location Detail:</b> Offshore - 20 miles off Gordo Bank<br>
<b>COUNTRY:</b> 16.1<br>
<b>COUNTRY 2:</b> -82.1<br>
<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Computers, smartphone, cash, electronics, binocular , vhf and handheld radios, alcohol, clothing<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A French flagged catamaran departed Isla Providencia (Colombia) for Rio Dulce, Guatemala on 1/18/2017 at 8 AM. Travelling well offshore the Nicaraguan coastline, they turned OFF their AIS transmitter but monitored all traffic closely. They noticed only a few cargo or fishing vessels.
At 0830 on the morning of the 19th, after traveling 175 nm, now located 70 nm off the Nicaraguan coast and 35 nm ESE of the Hobbies islands they were approached by a single panga from the north with 6-7 men who asked for water and food. They were provided. At 0900 the same panga returned asking for more, and a pack of cigarettes was given, while suddenly 2 more fishing boats with 40 HP outboards approached at high speed from the south with 6-7 additional men. They converged on the catamaran, rammed and boarded the yacht, now visibly armed with knives and iron bars. Some of the pirates beat the locked doors and gained entry to the cabin while the others scavenged on deck. The leaders seemed to be looking for drugs, but found none. The pirates took computers, a smartphone, cash, assorted electronics, binoculars, VHF and handheld radios, alcohol, clothing, anything that they could grab or remove. After about an hour they departed.
Using a previously hidden VHF the crew made contact with a nearby merchant cargo ship which then contacted the Colombian navy and piracy agency while diverting in their direction.  At 1030 AM a single panga returned with a mixed group of 8 of the youngest of the original pirates and again boarded, holding knives to the throats of the crew, this time attempting to sever the locked to the yacht dinghy/outboard. They were not successful and became nervous when they heard a VHF transmission from the approaching cargo vessel. The second group of pirates departed. The crew again made radio contact with the cargo vessel who took all necessary information and agreed to inform Colombian officials, the yacht declined further assistance and both vessels returned to their intended courses. The yacht proceeded to Guanaja, Honduras without further incident. They arrived on Friday January 20, and began the process of filing official reports with the police, port captain, Honduran navy and piracy agencies. Much had been stolen, there was damage to the yacht, but no injuries.<br>

<b>Country Name:</b> Honduras<br>
<b>Location Detail:</b> Offshore - 20 miles off Gordo Bank (16N/82W)<br>
<b>COUNTRY:</b> 16.<br>
<b>COUNTRY 2:</b> -82.<br>
<b>EVENT:</b> Piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> iPads, electronics, rum<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Preliminary Report : Chris Parker has provided the following information from a Weather Center subscribing yacht currently transiting from west Panama to the Yucatan. The yacht was boarded late on the 19th off Gordo Bank by pirates who seemed to be looking for drugs. Finding none, they took iPads, small electronics and rum. No injuries. No further infomation is currently available but a detailed report is expected once the yacht reaches its destination.
CSSN UPDATE 2017-01-26:  Victims have provided a detailed FIRST HAND REPORT:
A 40 ft. monohull sailing from Panama passed over Gorda Banks at night with their AIS turned off. Passing Gorda Cay, they saw several fair sized fishing boats at the cay. A couple of hours later as they were exiting the banks about 10 miles NW of Gorda Cay, a panga tried to approach but was not able to overtake them, they were sailing quite fast. 
The too-slow panga left but the men returned in a larger panga. Seeming friendly, they were fairly young and asked for food. They wouldn't leave the yacht alone, came close and were thrown a pineapple. They seemed happy and went away. A while later, another panga with several young men caught up with the yacht and asked for liquor. They were persistent but friendly and were tossed a six pack of beer. They also went away seeming happy. Then a third panga with a few men came asking for liquor. They were told they didn't have any and were tossed a melon. They went away. 
Meanwhile the crew had texted friends using their Delorme InReach satellite texting system, alerting them that they were being pursued and didn't know if these were just desperate fishermen or pirates. At about 12 noon 4 pangas with a total of about 30 men approached and the crew activated the DSC distress signals on the SSB and VHF. Their InReach contact alerted the US Coast Guard in Baltimore, MD, to the changing situation.
The pirates signaled for everyone to put their hands up as they boarded.  The lead panga carrying a man they all called “Boss" came alongside, bumping against the hull, and demanded in Spanish that they stop the engine. Faced with overwhelming force, they turned more into the wind and slowed down but pleaded ignorance as to their understanding of Spanish.
Several men boarded the boat. One had a knife that he continuously tapped on top of the chartplotter at the helm. One of the other men spoke some English and told the crew he wanted his men to go below and "inspect" the boat. He was told that only 2 at a time could go down, but several went down anyway. They turned off the SSB and VHF distress signals and ransacked the boat. They opened every cupboard and floorboard presumably looking for drugs. The English speaking pirate reported to "Boss" and when they found no drugs, the pirates down below took whatever they wanted, the most valuable of which included an iPad, a GPS, foul weather gear and shoes. Oddly, they did not ask for money. The “Boss” told them to finish up and the English speaking pirate made the crew shake hands as if this were a normal business transaction. The pirates motored away, and the crew continued sailing onward. 
The crew was grateful that they were not harmed. Official reports to authorities will be made after the yacht reaches the US mainland.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> At approximately 8 PM cruisers returned to the dinghy dock on the old pier in Esperanza, and discovered their dinghy/outboard had been stolen. The dinghy was chained to the dock with 3/8” stainless steel chain and locked with a case-hardened lock, the outboard engine was similarly chained and locked to the dinghy. 

The dinghy minus the outboard was found just off the beach to the east of the dock with both chains and one of the locks cut with a bolt cutter. A police report was made and victims were informed by the local police that this was the 4th motor theft this week. 

The owners indicate the police took little interest in assessing the situation - writing down little, looking at the dinghy or the area where it was left and they took no photos. The owners believe that well prepared theives with large bolt cutters are actively operating in the area and advise extra precautions.<br>

CSSN NOTE: This is the 3rd reported incident at this location in the last month.<br>

The dinghy was recovered the next morning swamped near the beach, minus the outboard which had been securely locked with a solid bar across the transom clamps. The thieves had used a 2x4 to sever it from the dinghy and apparently left by land vehicle. The fuel tank line was cut in 2 places and the tank was taken as well. A report was made to the local police. There were 6 other boats anchored in the bay that night, and one other had its dinghy/outboard stolen as well.

It ended up beating against the rocks and was found unsalvageable the next morning, the fuel tank and life jackets were recovered. A police report was made, but victims describe the police as “unhelpful”, and no incident report was provided. CSSN NOTE: This is the second report for this same night in this bay, see the prior report HERE. There have been 5 thefts reported to CSSN in Esperanza so far in 2017, and police indicated there were several other (not reported to CSSN)  dinghy/outboard thefts as well. Thieves operating in Esperanza are vigilant and well prepared, using large bolt cutters on well secured dinghies and trailers when required. Police there have not proven effective at controlling the persistent problem.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cameras, grinder, drill<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A motor yacht stored on the hard for hurricane season was burgled. The yacht was securely locked and a key provided to Boatyard/Marina office. The owners returned in December 2016 and found no signs of forced entry, but were surprised to find a payroll slip for a Jolly Harbor marina employee inside the boat. The employee had no approval or reason to be inside the locked boat. Marina/yard management was advised of the pay slip but offered no comment or explanation.

 A few weeks later the owners discovered that tools had been taken from various storage compartments inside the yacht. When they examined the yacht’s safe they discovered its hinge had been pried off from the rear and then carefully replaced, and the extensive camera equipment stored there was all missing as well.
 
CSSN NOTE: This is the third theft suffered by a stored yacht at this yard this season. Keys supplied to the office seem not to be kept under control, and were used to enter and remove property from the stored yachts/lockers, and then returned to the office.  If you leave your yacht and provide a key to anyone, be certain to understand how and where that key is kept secure, and how access/use is controlled, and in the case of multiple access, is signature logged.  Any unusual findings on return to the yacht should prompt immediate consultation with the yard management, and a thorough search of key areas/contents made at that time.
 
It’s easy to review the prior incidents, simply type “Jolly Harbor” in the search box on any CSSN website page.<br>

From behind the catamaran’s locked cockpit doors they observed a male boarder who stood in the cockpit, then sat and stared back at the astonished and concerned crew. A few minutes later he left. 

Later that morning a man was found asleep on an unoccupied boat on the adjacent dock, and when awakened and questioned he indicated he was waiting for the owner (who was not present) and then he departed. After a report was made to the Marina, a review of their video surveillance was made but the man’s face was obscured and not conclusive, but he appeared similar to the boarder, and the photos/description have been provided to the police and the marina guard.  The crew felt both the police and marina were responsive and the police advised calling the local emergency number in cases of future boardings.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 185ft 1/2inch Anchor Chain<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Overnight 185 ft. of ½ inch anchor chain was stolen. It had been stored in a metal barrel with a closed lid under a yacht located next to the restaurant at Clarkes Court Bay Boatyard. The owners discovered the theft the next day, the barrel had not been moved and the lid had been put back in place. Boatyard security/management was informed immediately, and admitted this was not the first theft of a significant amount of chain from the yard. The boatyard was well searched but no chain was found and owners “put out the word” that all they wanted was the chain back. The next day during a driving rain the owners were told by a boatyard subcontractor that a pile of chain was at the end of the yard, in an area that had been thoroughly searched the prior evening. It was their chain, lying on the same blue bag that had previously contained it, inside the now empty barrel. No police report was filed.

CSSN NOTE: While this may seem a satisfactory ending for these owners, others who visit this yard, or any other yard or marina, should ask about any incidents and make certain management has put effective processes in place to prevent theft from the premises. Asking these questions BEFORE you patronize a facility will allow you to make informed decisions, and serves as a reminder of the importance of good security to those responsible for providing it.  Those who have put robust processes in place, and then monitor their effectiveness, will be proud to tell you about them. Then make your own inspection. Examples of effective controls include well secured perimeters, gate control with logged access landside, 24HR monitoring of waterside access, robust video surveillance, inspection of exiting vehicles/backpacks, a posted policy of “zero tolerance” and prosecution of offenders.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> Owners of a yacht berthed on the outside dock at Marina Zar Par awakened to a masked intruder at their bedside. He spoke only Spanish (which they understood) smelled of alcohol and was dripping wet. He had gained entry thru the unlocked companionway.

 A brief struggle ensued, he demanded cash and jewelry, which was freely given. The intruder tied both crew up holding a knife to the woman’s neck. He held his hand roughly against her mouth to silence her causing minor injuries, which were later treated by a doctor.  After he departed, the crew managed to untie themselves and reported to the Zar Par Marina Security office. 

The security team provided immediate assistance by calling the police, who arrived promptly, and in gaining medical treatment for the woman.  A formal report was also made to the Coast Guard the next day, and the police are investigating.

CSSN UPDATE: September 15, 2017. A first hand report has been received from one of the victims. The captain and crew of an occupied catamaran at anchor in Prickly Bay were awakened at 04:30 when a thief who had boarded lowered and disconnected the raised dinghy/outboard from its davits, it was not locked to the yacht. After much yelling other boats in the anchorage became aware of the situation and the thief attempted to escape in the stolen dinghy. He drifted away but could not get it to start. He removed and discarded the fuel line before paddling it back to the yacht to retrieve his yellow kayak to make another escape attempt. A scuffle ensued but the thief escaped in the kayak which had remained tied behind the yacht. The dinghy was recovered, minus the fuel line. A report was made the next day to police/coast guard. The coast guard were in possession of (and trying to locate the true owners) another dinghy and also a compressor, found tied behind another (unoccupied) yacht the same night. Later, other yachts were found to have evidence of attempted break-ins.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> 55ft sailing yacht- monohull<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> In late April 2017 between the daylight hours of 1400 and 1715, a 55 ft. monohull sailing yacht moored in Clifton Harbor was stolen. The owner and crew were nearby but did not witness the actual theft. They notified SVG authorities (marine park, police and coast guard) and the owner began a localized search by boat which carried on into the darkness, but without result.
 
Early the next morning the SVG police insisted on further reports and after 3-4 hours of doing such the owner hired a pilot and personally conducted an aerial search. The boat was located at Diamond Island, a small rock islet between Grenada and Carriacou. An open boat was seen rapidly leaving the scene to the south. Grenada Coast Guard was notified but took no immediate action.  The pilot returned the owner to Union and he travelled by local boat to Carriacou where he contracted with another local boat to inspect and retrieve the yacht which had been damaged, arriving at the foundering yacht by early afternoon.
 
The thieves had damaged a hatch breaking into the yacht and stole many things including an outboard, dive gear, life jackets, fuel jugs, fenders, handheld VHF, etc.  The yacht sustained significant damage to its rudder and hull having been left to ground.  After emergency repairs and pumping the water out, the owner took the yacht to Carriacou under escort and after additional inspections and temporary repairs to Grenada for haulout and repairs , which have recently been completed. 

Neither the SVG officials (where the yacht was stolen) nor the Grenada officials (where the yacht was found) took any evidence from the scene and after many months, and many requests, no SVG police report has been made available to the victim.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A panga with a well secured 40 HP outboard was lifted at a private dock. Video surveillance from shore revealed that at 1:10 AM the thief unscrewed the light bulb on the dock, and then in darkness was able to use a box knife to cut the lifting strap, (damaging it) and releasing the panga. The 40HP outboard was visibly well secured to the panga, and would have required serious tools/effort to remove. The lifted panga was not secured to the dock. A report was made to the police and port captain.

CSSN NOTE: the same night a neighbor’s locked 85 HP engine was removed from its panga on a nearby dock. The thief left evidence of using tools to remove the 85 HP, but was unsuccessful in an attempt to also remove a 15HP engine.<br>

The pirates did NOT display any weapons, but simply overran the yacht. The captain did not resist in any way. The pirates ransacked the yacht for about an hour. They ""took everything"", cash,  phone, GPS, computer, dive gear, fishing gear, food, medicine, rum and many small items. The captain was able to negotiate with the leaders and was allowed to keep a navigational computer and a small GPS, as well as some jerry jugs of diesel. The pirates asked for drugs (there were none) before finally departing.

There were no injuries. The captain describes that damage to the yacht was out of ignorance, not malice.  A report was made to Colombian officials in Providencia on arrival. <br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Burglary<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, electronics (tablets, phones), fishing gear, knives, flashlight, clothes<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A family of experienced bareboat charterers anchored their monohull in Wallilabou, SVG and went ashore for dinner at the Anchorage Hotel Restaurant. They were aware and concerned about the brutal assault/murder of a German charterer and the subsequent lack of any arrest/prosecution in that bay in March 2016.  They reviewed the 2015/2016 17th edition cruise guide provided by their charter company, and believed that the author’s comment "The bay has had a reputation for occasional thievery, but it is hoped that a new security system, including video cameras monitored by the coast guard and security guards with flashlights, will put paid to that when anchored off the Wallilabou Anchorage Hotel." They assumed the security system had been put in place. 

They enjoyed dinner ashore and had a full view of the boat from the restaurant. At 8PM when they returned to the boat, however, they discovered that the locked yacht had been burgled.  A forward hatch had been damaged to gain entry. The thieves had thoroughly searched/ransacked all the cabins, lockers and luggage. They found and stole all the hidden cash and personal electronics. They also stole fishing gear, clothing, knives and flashlights. 

The victims contacted the restaurant, who called the police.  Three officers arrived in casual clothes and looked around. They took no notes, pictures or any forensic evidence whatsoever, but claimed they would investigate. The victims provided a list of the stolen items and a signed written statement. The officers promised to send the written declaration to the headquarters of the criminal police department in the capital city of Kingstown. They advised that the only way for the victims to get any written confirmation of this case would require the victims to personally visit Kingstown police HQ. 

The victims arranged transportation to Kingstown police HQ the next day.  There the officers immediately tried to send them away, but the victims insisted and they took their statement (again) in exchange for a $100 ECD fee. Despite repeated requests the police refused to provide a receipt for this payment. They also refused to provide any written confirmation of receipt of the report. The victims used a cell phone to take a picture of their written statement, and a letter they had written to the SVG Chief of Police. The victims were told that an official written report could be picked up in a couple of weeks. Because they planned to have returned to Europe in that timeframe the victims asked that the formal report be sent by email, which the police promised to do. The victims have had NO contact from SVG police or any SVG officials, despite many repeated requests and attempts to contact the responsible persons both by email and telephone. 

CSSN NOTE: Over a year later, the victims decided it was important to tell their story. The business owners and others had implored them NOT to make any public report, and the police had ignored their report and failed to do anything but take their $100 ECD. They did not observe any patrols or video surveillance, those too an empty promise. CSSN has now updated our database to include this report.

Sadly, actions to suppress reporting of crimes is too common by those with economic interests, leaving the larger cruising community unaware and at increased risk. The victims in this case want others to know not only about the misleading information presented in the cruise guide, and the self-serving pleas of the local business interests to not make any information public, but also the disregard of the police and other officials to take any action, including simply providing the paid for and promised written report. 

Timely and complete reports are easy to make, use the CSSN online reporting form. Reporting - it’s everyone’s responsibility. Take a few minutes to review a recently published article published in Caribbean Compass on this important topic.<br>

The crew immediately altered course and turned offshore. When the pirates came closer the crew fired their flare gun directly at the pirates, and nearly hit them. The pirates, apparently understanding the fire hazard a burning flare would pose to their gasoline fueled boat turned away, dropped back and made no further approaches.  The yacht then headed northwest and made safe port at Porlamar, Margarita, where a report was made to local officials.<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted piracy<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> n/a<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing yacht with 2 persons onboard departed Belize for Panama via Providencia. Off the Gordo Banks at 5PM at a position of 16*36.700N 082*17.280W they observed a small fishing boat with an enclosure on an intersecting course. They immediately altered course 90 degrees and noticed the small boat continued to attempt to follow. 2 other small fishing boats were spotted about 2-3 miles further away.

Listening to VHF they heard a discussion in Spanish about stealing a dingy (theirs was on the foredeck) and no other vessels were in the vicinity. The crew hailed a merchant vessel located about 15 nmiles away, and one of the small fishing boats made a false response, attempting to impersonate the merchant vessel.  A private VHF DSC call was made to the merchant ship. Radar indicated that the small boats were unable to close the gap into difficult sea and wind conditions, and had fallen further out of range as it became dark.  The yacht continued without lights or AIS transmit.

<b>EVENT:</b> Attempted piracy<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> none, not successful<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Two yachts departed Isla Providencia, Colombia for the Cayman Islands. They traveled northward together on a moonless night with lights and AIS.  They were clear of the Gordo Banks region by about 30 miles. Feeling they were out of the piracy danger zone (see prior reports to CSSN) one of the boats raised full sail and began to pull away just before sunrise. 

 At 9 am the second yacht, a French flagged 51ft. monohull with a family of 5 onboard, at position  16-04.31N/81- 18.51W now more than 100 miles off the Honduran coast , sighted a fishing boat of about 10 meters overloaded with a dozen men onboard on an intersecting course.  They attempted to contact their friends who were still in visual range on VHF 08, (which they had used sparingly overnight), but without success.  They heard another conversation in a strange language/dialect (not Spanish/French/English) that included “barco grande, barco grande”. When they tried to call their friends on VHF 16 the channel was immediately blocked by very loud, continuous music.
 
The suspect pirate boat was able to pull parallel and close to 50 meters, and the occupants displayed a nervous and aggressive attitude.  They were not friendly fishermen wanting to trade. No weapons were visible.

The yacht had put on all remaining sail and then attempted to add the engine, but it failed. Changing course to the SE put the pirate vessel at a disadvantage to the increasing wind and seas and the yacht was able to increase the distance separating the 2 vessels. Eventually the pirates fell back and the yacht turned northward.  The yacht made contact with the French Coast Guard (Cross) by satellite phone, and the French Coast Guard maintained regular contact for the next several hours.
 
At 5 PM, alerted by the French CG, the Honduran navy reached the yacht by satellite phone and advised in English that they were still in danger, and that there were now 2 armed Honduran Naval vessels approaching the area but outside VHF range, who would escort the yacht back to safe port in Honduras. The yacht declined, but welcomed the presence of the Honduran Navy, and continued northward toward their planned destination. 

Overnight and into the next day the French CG maintained regular satellite phone contact with the yacht, and later alerted officials in Cayman about the yachts expected arrival that evening, and their engineless status. They were met and assisted by Cayman CG/port officials to a mooring on arrival. 

CSSN would like to thank the volunteer translators who so kindly assisted with this report.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A yacht transiting northward from Isla Providencia, Columbia to Grand Cayman, at a position of 15-45 N - 81-32 W was off the Gordo banks and traveling dark, and noticed a suspicious vessel on an intercept course from the WSW at 2245 HRS.  At 2315 the suspect vessel was within a few hundred meters, displaying only running lights.  The yacht assumed it was law enforcement and turned on its lights and made 3-4 calls on VHF 16  that were not answered. 

The suspect vessel continued to track on an intercept course and increased speed in clear pursuit. The yacht was now able to identify the large 70+ ft. boat as a fishing trawler type vessel. The yacht was making good speed with full sail and added engine to further increase speed and was able to outpace the suspect vessel, which after 20 minutes gave up the pursuit, then stopped dead and lit up. The captain believes he was a target of opportunity and that the trawler was on the banks to fish.

<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull was 1 of about 9 yachts on PAYS moorings in the bay. When the owners returned to their boat at 1700 HRS they discovered a man inside their boat. He had broken the lock to gain access and rummaged the saloon and cabins in an apparent search for cash (there was none). He jumped overboard as they approached and claimed that he had not taken anything (TRUE) and that there was another man onboard (UNTRUE). The owners called PAYS on VHF and they came to the area ashore and recognized the man, but did not detain him as they believed he had a knife. 

The next day PAYS took one of the owners ashore to meet with the police at a nearby restaurant (that had also had an incident of some sort that the police were investigating). The police did not visit or take any evidence from the yacht, and the PAYS rep named the man to the police. No follow-up information from the police or PAYS has been provided to the victims.<br>

Initially, provisional equipment will be used, but a bigger patrol boat in association with a small patrol boat are expected. Locally, the Navy (call name: Richard) can be reached on VHF channel 68 24/7 in case of emergency. The National Police indicated that a 911-call will activate the patrols around the bay at all times.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> During the night, police stopped/apprehended a suspect carrying suspicious items in his car. They posted pictures of the items along with a photo of the suspect and his driver's license on the Luperon Cruisers Facebook page. The items were not immediately recognized so a search was made of unoccupied yachts. A caretaker of a sailboat whose owner was away discovered that the locked yacht had been broken into and ransacked and identified the items as belonging to that boat. Charges were filed by the caretaker on the owners behalf, and the items were returned to the yacht.

At about 1 AM they noticed 3 swimmers, each with a submersible light, as they approached the yacht anchored closest to shore. One of the swimmers began boarding by the stern ladder on the 1st yacht while the other 2 swimmers remained nearby. The observing yacht activated their security lights, and all 3 swimmers lights immediately turned toward the observing yacht, then all 3 of them swam away, passing slowly and close by the 2nd yacht.
 
After nearly an hour, stopping several times to turn and observe the watching yacht, the swimmers exited at the beach. The yacht departed at first light, and no police report was made.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, credit cards, 3 iPhones, iPad, handbag and 6 bottles of rum<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull anchored in an area north of the Marigot Bay harbor and south of Castries. No other yachts were nearby.

All 3 onboard went for a snorkel nearby (about 30 meters away) and did not lock the boat. A local transport boat was waiting to unload and anchored about 100 meters away and witnessed the boarding and theft that occurred during the 30-40 minutes the crew was snorkeling. One swimmer kept a watch while 3 others boarded and ransacked the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, iPhones, iPad, a purse and rum, leaving behind wet footprints that the victims discovered on their return. 

The witnesses on the nearby boat assisted the victims in making contact with the police. The victims made their first report at the local police station and were told to collect it at a different station. Two days later at the second station, the report seemed to have been “misplaced” when they went to collect it, and they were told to return the next day. They returned, but the report could still not be found, so a new report was completed.  
 
The victims indicate that the police seemed disinterested, and they failed to collect any meaningful information (a good description of one of the thieves was available, but not recorded). The subsequent investigation onboard included only photos of areas irrelevant to the theft, and no forensic/fingerprint analysis.<br>

CSSN NOTE: Attempts to board other yachts in the anchorage were made this same night most likely by this same group of armed thieves.  One later boarding was only deterred when the owner’s large dog made its presence known on deck. (See next report)    Details of some other attempts/boardings are incomplete. If you were a victim, of a boarding or attempted boarding, PLEASE contact CSSN and complete an online incident report. (LINK to online form)<br>

<b>EVENT:</b> Suspicious activity<br>
<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> <br>
<b>SECURED:</b> <br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> During a night transit from Chaguaramas, Trinidad to Grenada at 0400 hours and approximately 6 nm South of the Hibiscus gas platform, a boat about a mile ahead and slightly off to port of the yachts track suddenly switched on an array of nonstandard lights, including a flashing red/green light, and two or three hand held lights. The yachts crew were monitoring VHF 16 and could not determine what this boat was doing or its intentions.

 After a while they passed it port side to at about a quarter of a mile. The boat then motored around astern of the yacht, and began to follow, gradually closing to about 100yds astern over the next 20 minutes. Once it became clear they were being followed, the yacht went dark, all navigation lights and other visible lighting were doused. Defensive equipment was made ready on deck, and full speed on engine and full sail was made, approximately 7kts.
 
After an additional  20 minutes the suspect vessel dropped back, and once far enough away, the yacht changed course 60 degrees with intermittent further changes over time to make themselves more difficult to find, and to keep well clear of the normal Hibiscus direct route to Grenada. The crew had no doubt they had been checked out as a possible target for attack, and a full report was made to TTCG.

<b>EVENT:</b> Suspicious activity<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> None<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A 50 ft. catamaran with 5 persons onboard departed Fernando De Noronha, Brazil on 19 January 2019, northbound. To avoid small ships, their routing kept them well off the South American coast, 170 - 200 miles, in international waters.  Before approaching the area of Trinidad and Tobago, they filed a float plan with the Trinidad/Tobago Coast Guard and monitored VHF 16/68 continuously. 

After passing 50 miles to the east of Tobago, at 8 PM on February 2, at position LAT: 12.27.0 N LONG: 060.47.39 W (approximately 66 miles north of Tobago and 38 miles off the east coast of  Grenada) the watch detected a white and red light on the horizon, approaching.

The captain was awoken and confirmed that the light configuration had not altered course or changed bearing. The yachts radar MARPA target confirmed that there was no change on the vessels course. The yacht took immediate avoiding action, turning hard to starboard to pass the vessel port to port. The vessel altered its course to intercept the new course of the yacht. Another avoiding action was taken by the yacht, turning hard to port to pass starboard to the now suspect vessel. The suspect vessel yet again took an intercepting course and MARPA indicated a collision and an increase in speed of the suspect vessel to 6 knots. 

The yacht turned on its port engine and furled the sails and turned hard to starboard again. The suspect vessel yet again took an intercepting course and had now closed to about 2 miles. The suspect vessel turned on red and blue flashing lights in an attempt to approach the yacht, but made no radio contact.  The suspect vessel continued its intercept approach and ended up within 200 meters while displaying red and blue flashing lights. 

The captain and crew recognized the ruse and non-legitimate nature of the light display. The yacht went dark, and engaged the starboard engine. With both engines at full rpm, they fled the impostor vessel at approximately 11 knots.  The impostor vessel appeared limited to a speed of 6 knots, and continued its pursuit, but did not identify itself via AIS or make any radio contact. The yacht continued to make course changes over the next several hours as the impostor vessel continued to follow. The yacht arrived in Carriacou the following day, and made reports to Customs and Immigration officials there.
 
CSSN NOTE: Legitimate marine/law enforcement officials (Trinidad/Tobago, Grenada, USCG) do NOT display flashing red/blue lights, the international standard is flashing/strobe blue, and make clear their intentions to approach closely/board with radio contact or loud hailer.<br>

They noticed a local open motor boat with one man aboard idling slowly around the anchorage, and saw him tie up to a nearby mooring, jump in, swim to their boat, climb the ladder and enter their salon. They immediately began shouting and swimming back towards their vessel, which alerted others on boats in the anchorage who also began shouting at the intruder, who then jumped off the yacht and swam back to his boat and then motored away. Owners returned to their yacht and used their dinghy to pursue the individual, who had moored off the beach. When confronted he said he “did not steal anything”, and “sorry”.  Vessels in the anchorage were notified by VHF, and the marina dock master was provided a picture of the intruder’s boat.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> CSSN PRELIMINARY REPORT :    A 53’ Trinidad flagged monohull transiting from Trinidad to Grenada with 2 persons onboard was approached by 8 pirates in an open piroque at 10:30 AM, at approximate position 11-24N, 61-36W, about 16 miles NNE of the Hibiscus gas platform, and 37 miles south of Grenada. 

The pirates 40 ft. boat had 2 large outboards, was white/blue with an orange bow and approached from the east. The pirates fired warning shots into the air and indicated they wished the yacht to stop. It did not. Additional warning shots were fired as the helmsman attempted to use the VHF radio, which he did not. High seas prevented the piroque from successfully approaching and boarding as the yacht maintained full speed and began zigzag maneuvers.  Additional shots were then fired at the boat and helmsman, damaging the hull and coach roof, but no injuries were sustained. 

The pirates gave up and fled the area at high speed to the west. Reports were made by the victims on arrival in Grenada to both Grenada and Trinidad/Tobago Coast Guard (TTCG). 

Yachting Services Association Trinidad/Tobago (YSATT) indicates that TTCG are on “High Alert” and have added assets and increased patrols in the area.  As the overall situation in nearby Venezuela is not expected to improve, plans are being formulated to form escort/convoys.  Float plans filed with TTCG and North Post Radio remain the best method for communicating with officals there.

Additional details are expected and CSSN will update this report when they are received.<br>

<b>HAND:</b> 1<br>
<b>Stolen Items:</b> everything from deck, 12 scuba tanks, RIB dinghy, liferaft , all dive gear, stern anchor , all navigation electronics +<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A Canadian flagged yacht with 4 persons onboard departed Roatan, Honduras for Isla Providencia, Colombia. At 1742 HRS, at a position of 14-50N, 82-47W, approximately 23 miles ESE of Cabo Gracias a Dios, they were approached by 2 local fishing boats (pangas) with about 10-12 men. Initially they asked for food and drink, which the crew provided.  The 2 pangas drifted back a bit and were seen making calls on handheld VHF radios. Two (2) additional pangas then arrived, and all 4 (now 20-25 men in total) surrounded the yacht, and began ramming the yacht, damaging the stern ladder and swim platform, damaging the hull on both sides, and then began boarding the yacht. 

The crew had begun MAYDAY calls on VHF and retreated and secured themselves safely below, protected by interior security bars that covered all hatches and companionways. Mayhem ensued topsides, as the pirates ransacked and destroyed sails, halyards, cushions, etc. The pirates used fishing knives and the yacht&#39;s heavy winch handles to smash all port lights, the pilothouse windows, and the plexiglass hatch (which they then discovered was protected by interior security bars). The pirates proceeded to steal all electronic and navigation equipment, scuba tanks, scuba gear, the yachts RIB dinghy, liferaft and various other items.
 
The crew continued with VHF MAYDAY calls (no response) and activated DSC (no response). They activated the SOS function on their inReach satellite communicator and received prompt text replies, indicating the Nicaraguan Navy had been informed of the situation, but could not give a time of arrival on the scene. After about 40 minutes the pirates had seemingly exhausted themselves, and stolen, discarded overboard or destroyed almost everything within reach of the topsides.
 
The 4 pangas departed back toward the Nicaraguan coast. The yacht proceeded under power and set course directly away from the coast, to Providencia, and arrived there the next afternoon having had no contact from the Nicaraguan Navy.  Reports were made to the Colombian Port Captain and Coast Guard. Some repairs were effected and the yacht will soon continue on to Panama, where further repairs will be made and a report will be made to Canadian consular officials.
  
This event differed in some respects from prior small boat piracy events in the region. Please review the CSSN Central America regional Piracy Zoom-Tap, Know&amp;Go interactive infographic for complete information on those events, and review the CSSN region specific Piracy Precautions – Central America page.  A well thought out and executed plan protected this crew from physical harm.
  
Additional details and insights provided by the captain are available here, on Noonsite, a longtime CSSN partner.<br>

CSSN has verified a limited number of facts with the victims’ designated representative. The situation remains dynamic as the investigation by Panamanian authorities moves forward, and the legal process follows. 

Three pirates boarded the family yacht, located near Dad Naggwe Dubbir island in the Guna Yala/San Blas islands of Panama in the early hours of May 2, 2019. The captain died of wounds received in the attack, and other family members were injured.  Three suspects were taken into custody in the Colon jurisdiction.

Multiple press reports contain information that has not been verified (some of it inconsistent), but might be considered helpful, particularly those portions attributed by direct quote to family members.

<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Two occupants asleep aboard a catamaran anchored in Placencia harbor, Belize were awakened by noise around 03:45 am. The vessel owner witnessed an adult male boarder exiting the cockpit overboard from port transom, capsizing his fishing canoe in his haste to escape. The boarder spoke to owner as he swam away, "I'm sinking, sir." Owner clearly saw his face.
Subsequently, the vessel occupants observed water on the floor in the saloon and discovered cash was stolen from a wallet (approx. US$120). The occupants noticed the overturned canoe drifting away and the owner launched the dinghy, retrieved the canoe, and secured it to the vessel.
After daybreak, the owner went ashore and made a full report of the incident to the Placencia Police and reviewed mug shots, identifying several individuals that could have been the intruder. The Police retrieved the canoe as evidence. The Police refused to provide a copy of the Police Report to the vessel owner on the grounds that it was "privacy information." The owner went to the local tourist office to also report the incident there, but the office was closed. The owner alerted other cruising vessels in the area (~25 yachts) of the incident via VHF broadcast and answered all questions. The victim vessel departed Placencia later that morning and did not receive any further communication from the Placencia Police. <br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A sailing vessel enroute from Providencia, Columbia to the Bay Islands, Honduras at 16 27.700' N 84 50.914' W at 22:45 sighted two boats off their bow approximately 5 nm away. The crew on the vessel began monitoring a conversation on VHF 16 in Spanish involving three boats after hearing the word “velero” (sailboat). The VHF conversation eventually seemed to suggest that a plan was being made to attack the yacht. One of the captains was heard to say “I have no fish in my boat, let's see if we can put something else in it.” At this point, the yacht went dark and changed course 60-90 degrees to starboard. After about 30 minutes, one of the vessels that had been sighted was determined to be approaching on an intercepting course. This boat was raised on the bow and the stern like a typical Caribbean steel fishing boat of ~60 feet. About 1 hour later at 16 29.157'N, 84 58.678'W, the vessel had approached within 500ft but then stopped. VHF 16 conversation resumed with one captain calling the other two boats, only one of which responded to hails. The yacht continued its course at maximum speed, with no further pursuit. A report was made to the port captain in Roatan after arrival.<br>

<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull transiting from Providencia, Colombia to the Bay Islands, Honduras was approached by a white pilothouse fishing vessel ~ 45ft on June 27 at 00:00, position 16 20.486' N 82 57.469' W. The yacht deviated to starboard 20 degrees and the fishing vessel matched course change to follow. The yacht again deviated to starboard and started their engine and increased speed to 8 knots. The suspect vessel again took an intercept course and closed to within 150ft, then matched the yacht’s speed and tried to come along aside. At this point, the yacht released sails and made a hard turn to port, passing behind the stern of the other vessel. They shut off all lights, changed course again and motorsailed at 8 knots away from the vessel. The suspect vessel initially turned to follow but did not increase speed and eventually resume its original course. No attempt to contact on VHF 16 was made by either vessel. The sailboat continued its course to Roatan and encountered suspicious activity the following night (see related report). A report was made to the Port Captain in Roatan after arrival.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, personal communication devices, laptops, entertainment electronics, videocameras, credit cards, satellite phone, drone, EPIRB<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> N/A<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull with 2 persons on board departed Linton Bay, Panama for the San Blas islands. Engine issues caused the yacht to make an unplanned stop in Bahia Nombre de Dios, where no other boats were anchored.  The necessary repairs were completed but the hour was late and entering the San Blas in the dark was not an option. The crew planned to lock themselves in securely for the night.

They were down below and surprised just after sunset at 1930 HRS by noise on deck. The captain went up to the cockpit and was ambushed and then restrained by 2 swimmers who had boarded and concealed themselves behind opposite sides of the spray hood.  Immediately a boat with 4 other men arrived and the captain was held at gunpoint, and then forced back down into the cabin. He had alerted his crew and she had locked herself into a cabin. There were now 6 men onboard, with their faces concealed by t-shirts. The leader held a semiautomatic handgun to the captain’s head.  The crew decided the cabin would not remain safe and decided to cooperate fully and came out of the cabin.

For 45 minutes the men ransacked and inspected every space in the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, phones, cameras and video equipment, laptops, a drone, EPIRB, etc. Several of the items were well concealed. Some of the men appeared to be high on drugs, and were only marginally under the control of the armed leader. Two of the men forced the crew member back into a cabin and indicated they intended to rape her, but the leader prevented this.  Once they had collected all things of value all 6 men departed in their boat.

Finally, certain the men had departed the crew exited the cabin and untied the captain. They upped anchor to return to Linton Bay. They noticed their EPIRB blinking in the water near shore, apparently it had been dropped in the water and self-activated. The crew activated DSC and called pan pan on VHF but had NO response. AIS showed large ships nearby. The yacht arrived back at Linton Bay at 2200 HRS.

The Linton Bay marina security team noticed the bright light the crew was waving and went immediately to the anchored yacht. After understanding the situation marina personnel acted quickly and contacted Aeronaval (coastguard) who arrived in a few minutes from their nearby station. Some photos were taken and they indicated they would return with police on Monday, (24+ HRS later). Which they did, and they transported the victims to an inland town to make a formal police report. After many hours waiting no report was made due to the lack of a translator. A second meeting was scheduled and the translator was available and the formal report finally made 2 days later.  Follow up sessions to collect forensics on the boat were scheduled for later in the week. The victims have informed their consular officials who are expected to assist.

CSSN NOTE: Unintentionally the water activated EPIRB fulfilled part of its intended purpose. After quick confirmation from the owner’s shore side contacts, who had up to date travel plans for the yacht, it was recognized that the unexpected “land” location was an emergency. Direct contact was then made with a nearby (2miles) police station and Aeronaval station (5 miles) but no action was taken by either. DSC and pan pan calls by the yacht did not generate any response or assistance.<br>

<b>SECURED:</b> Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> While monohull owners slept onboard in their forward cabin, thieves stole the lifted and locked to the yacht dinghy from its davits at the stern. The thieves arrived prepared with bolt cutters and knives and defeated both the stainless steel locks, that had exposed hasps/shackles (for the outboard to the dinghy, and the dinghy to the yacht). They cut numerous retaining lines, and the davit lines, but were unable to cut the dyneema bridle/harness.

Apparently, the thieves misjudged the weight of the 30HP outboard and it, as well as the small rowboat type dinghy they had used were found the next day underwater, sunk to the bottom below the yacht. Both were retrieved. The RIB dinghy had been set adrift, and was found 8 miles offshore by another yacht, and returned to the owners. All of the items in the dinghy were untouched. A police report was made, and the coast guard notified.<br>

<b>Stolen Items:</b> Cash, credit cards, 3 iPhones, iPad, handbag and 6 bottles of rum<br>
<b>SECURED:</b> Not Locked<br>
<b>DETAILS:</b> A monohull anchored in an area north of the Marigot Bay harbor and south of Castries. No other yachts were nearby.

All 3 onboard went for a snorkel nearby (about 30 meters away) and did not lock the boat. A local transport boat was waiting to unload and anchored about 100 meters away and witnessed the boarding and theft that occurred during the 30-40 minutes the crew was snorkeling. One swimmer kept a watch while 3 others boarded and ransacked the yacht, stealing cash, credit cards, iPhones, iPad, a purse and rum, leaving behind wet footprints that the victims discovered on their return. 

The witnesses on the nearby boat assisted the victims in making contact with the police. The victims made their first report at the local police station and were told to collect it at a different station. Two days later at the second station, the report seemed to have been “misplaced” when they went to collect it, and they were told to return the next day. They returned, but the report could still not be found, so a new report was completed.  
 
The victims indicate that the police seemed disinterested, and they failed to collect any meaningful information (a good description of one of the thieves was available, but not recorded). The subsequent investigation onboard included only photos of areas irrelevant to the theft, and no forensic/fingerprint analysis.<br>

The theft was discovered in the early morning Sunday when the crew member attempted to find the phone. Also missing was a backpack which had contained miscellaneous items including a headlamp and wallet (cash, credit cards, passports, identity documents).

A complete police report was made the next morning (Monday) with the assistance of a friend/translator on a yacht anchored nearby in this popular anchorage off St. George's. The police indicated that a forensics investigator would visit the yacht later that day, which did not happen. A passing Coast Guard boat (unaware of what had happened) was hailed down, and they explained that only the police could conduct the required onboard forensics investigation.

<b>DETAILS:</b> UPDATED REPORT: This report replaces our prior preliminary report. The victims made contact with CSSN and provided additional details about the event.
 
A monohull sailing yacht with 4 men and 2 women onboard departed Linton Bay and due to unfavorable conditions made an unplanned stop in Bahia Nombre de Dios, anchoring there at about 13:00 HRS. There were no other yachts present in the bay.
  
At about 19:00 HRS, just after dark they were approached and overrun by 8 men who arrived in 3-4 pangas (engineless boats). The men concealed their faces and had hand guns (1 semi-automatic and a revolver) and knives. The crew was restrained and for approximately 45 minutes the men stole everything they could - cash, personal devices, boat electronics and gear, clothing, liquor and cigarettes.
 
After the robbers departed the crew was able to remove their restraints and they returned to Linton Bay and berthed at the marina. The women were taken to the hospital for evaluation/treatment. Reports were made to the police, CG, port captain, and the home country consular officials contacted. 
 
The Panamanian police began their investigation and have made 6 arrests as of 12 November 2019.
 
CSSN NOTE: There have been similar incidents reported in this same bay in the recent past. The first occurred in July 2019, and the most recent less than a week prior.<br>
