<b>Additional Location Details:</b> Please check for the coyote den at 15100 Edgewater Dr, as this house is for sale and has been unoccupied for a VERY long time.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> On 8/2 at 2210 my two dogs and I were chased by a young coyote. It came from Lakewood Catholic Academy's grounds (from the right side if looking at the front of the school) as we were walking along Lake Rd from Rosalie towards the Park (East). I yelled at it, it stopped, hesitated, then began running as us again. I crossed the street in traffic, cars about 60 yards apart, risking my life and my dog's in order for someone to honk their horn and buy us time. The coyote proceeded to follow us on the other side of the street, not crossing over to the South side of Lake but following us as I ran home passing Abbeshire and then on to Rosalie. The coyote went down Abbeshire and we booked it to my residence on Rosalie.

On 8/3, our neighbors were on their porch watching the storm and witnessed a coyote going up and down our street, driveway to driveway (searching? smart?). My neighbors confirmed seeing it go up 1061 Rosalie Ave's driveway.

A few days back, I am told one was spotted on Leedale, and Summit (north of Lake).

My dogs are not small. The coyote did not care that I was with them. My dogs are the same size as the coyotes (they are coon hounds, about 55 lbs... not huge, but not small like previous attacks). This is a major problem that the coyote(s) are searching yards looking to kill dogs. As is obvious, our dogs mean everything to us and these threats must be eliminated. I will eliminate if I see again, myself. I am prepared to do so.

I'm not sure where the traps are being set up, or if there is a search for the den but there are several houses for sale in the area without current tenants (the other one I'm thinking of is at 1048 Summit Ave, I believe).

This needs escalated to a high level. These coyotes are acting out of character for coyotes, and are aggressive, dangerous and hungry. I am told there is a mother and 3 pups. She appears to be training them right now. 

Thank you!<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Hello.  I am sure the city is tired of hearing about concerns over the coyote(s) in the Overlook Park neighborhood.  
But my neighbors and I have seen the coyote(s) four times in the past week in our area.  We feel they are mostly staying around the Edgewater Drive / Estill Dr. area.  We are very upset about the danger to our pets.  We have bought air horns and are trying our best to prevent a repeat attack on our animals.  One such attack happened months ago to one of our pets on Estill.  We are afraid about being out after dark.  A few nights ago, the coyote was spotted in the backyard of Stacy and Walter's home on the northeast corner of Edgewater and Estill.  It showed no fear of the tactics being used to scare the animal away.  
Please consider setting another trap or a few traps in our area.  
It is such a beautiful neighborhood that we are not enjoying because of this fear.  We are all in our homes before dusk.  
Please help us out.<br>

Parking in Lakewood is hard enough without having to deal with the ignorance of people who feel they can do whatever they want.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> While walking down the street after voting I was stopped by a police officer in a vehicle. He asked what I was doing, and when I replied that I was walking he demanded my identification. I responded that I would rather not give him my I.D. He told me he had observed me looking in car windows, and that there had been a lot of break- ins recently. I explained that I frequently take walks and pick up litter on the streets while doing so. He requested my identification again when he told me it was illegal to walk in the street. He then radioed to the dispatcher with my information and wrote it in his notebook. To me this is awful police work. To take up my time, to embarrass me in front of anyone who might be watching, and to imply that I was casing automobiles, when I am out trying to enjoy a walk and help keep Lakewood tidy.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Drunken man followed my 10 yr old grandson into elevator and up to our apartment, yesterday around 3:15 pm. When the child went inside and closed the door, the man commenced banging on the door loudly and wouldn't stop, so I went to the door but did not open it, as I could tell he was very drunk. He was yelling through the door to get me to open it and he was saying he was "watching out for the little girl" (He's a boy, anyhow!) I asked his name, he said,"Ron". He is not any Ron that we know. He kept on and on about how he was watching the child alone on the elevator. I told him to be watchful from a distance in future. He was very loud and disorderly. I called my son , who lives in an upstairs apartment, and he got there just after the guy left. 
My husband, who had dropped Drew(child) off at the door and was parking the car, exited the elevator as this "Ron" was getting on. He said he has seen the guy before but doesn't know him, that he was falling-down drunk. We were very frightened by the incident and disturbed to know that this man now knows where Drew lives.
I called our office manager and she said she would look at security tapes to try to see who "Ron" is. She has a grandchild living here, too. They are the only children in this senior oriented building.
I had not intended to report this to Police, but friends said I should. I know there are a lot of sex offenders in this area, and we never let Drew out to play alone. It never occurred to us that he'd be in any danger walking from the front door to the apartment.<br>

Grass for front lawn is rarely cut and in places 6-8 inches high. Back yard in infested with weeds and no vermin (possum and raccoons are regularly sighted there and could be living in the vacant home). Backyard trees are overgrown and I was told that at my expense, I can trim them off of my garage and driveway. I have no choice but to do so as my garage roof is now being damaged, however, what is the City going to do about having a vacant nuisance property next door to me that is not maintained and now becoming a home for vermin?  Please advise and thank you.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> After having my land surveyed, I had installed orange plastic fencing held up by wooden stakes. I recently noticed that not only have the stakes and fence been removed, but so have the "Private Property" signs that were installed on MY garage. Since the fence and stakes were stolen, several pots containing plants were
placed on my property. I cannot, and will not be responsible for anything that is placed on my property by someone else.                Any attempt that I have made to contact the apartment building's management(at 2095 Northland) has not gotten any response.
Furthermore, there have been numerous occasions where one or two specific tenants of the apartment building have been seen "snooping" around various contractor's vehicles and tools while their equipment was in my driveway.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> the paramedics were wonderful and caring
the ambulance was in poor operating order the hydraulic system was unreliable the ambulance stalled while the safety forces were attending me in my home for transfer. The back  clock was not operational. The co2 alarm wailed away darning the trip disgraceful! you give away our hospital but neglect the equipment   our first responders use. this city feels like it is being  run like east Cleveland. my I suggest ever counsel man/women be strapped down in the ambulance and be driven down bunts rd. and see the  ride you get! appalling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is not a first responder issue its a city counsel issue. Its time to fund for updated equipment that services the residences an visitors since its a pay to ride service.Again get strapped don and ride in our city equipment and experience what our first responders put up daily, and update our city's equipment. At over  $700.00  a ride any prudent consumer would demand a adjustment!
Thank you for your time Michael b. bailey
our  first responders are terrific.........

<b>Description of Problem:</b> The construction crew dug up the street yesterday and placed a large metal road plate over the hole.  However, the plate is obviously not flush so literally every time a car has driven over it in the past 24 hours there is a very loud noise as it shifts.  Can the construction crew fix this?  Doesn't seem like it would be that difficult .. wedge something in the uneven corner like you would when fixing an unbalanced table.  You can view video here for reference: https://photos.app.goo.gl/68JAIDhCdRVORRtC2.  Please advise, thanks!<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> I just bought my house at the end of April that is on W Clifton. My driveway is considered a street, Shaw Ave, where my neighbors use to access their homes. I was wondering If that street can be repaired? There is a lot of access from cars going to and from houses behind my house on Shaw Ave. The Garbage men also
use that street to pick up mine and my neighbors trash. There are many holes and repairs needed on this road.
I have also received a request to fix my sidewalk on this street and I feel like this should be talked about before any commitment is made on how I want to move forward. Thanks for your help,

I have personally walk by the house while the dog was barking to verify the address.  This has been going on all summer and I don't think just because people close their windows for the cold weather this should be permitted to continue. Thank You! Your department has always been responsive to these matters and I do appreciate it. I have also talked to Mayor Mike Summers about this matter at the 'Talk to the Mayor' evenings and he said he'd look into the situation.<br>

Also, there are weeds that are knee high in the lot where they park their fleet.  I have contacted Bob Sisler, their partner about the situation and he assured me that they were going
to buy a lawn mower and take care of the problem yesterday.  It has still not been done.
We have a beautiful street and the first impression that anyone gets when turning south on Parkwood from Detroit Road is the unkept tree lawn.  It is an embarrassment to the neighborhood.  We want to be good neighbors with WingStar but so far they have been a disappointment.<br>

During 3:30 the whole street of Bunts is blocked- not allowing residents to pull out or emergency vehicles to pass.  Also around 7:45 am you see a similar problem.  In addition to the 5 o'clock problem in the other direction on Bunts.  This is a problem that has never been seen before on Bunts before.  Please fix for the community and the emergency vehicles.  It is an Emergency route and should never have grid lock..<br>

<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Franklin<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> traffic lights at the corner of Bunts and Franklin Rd.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> Ever since the installation of the new traffic lights there has been a major backup of traffic on bunts rd at the intersection of Bunts and Franklin (traffic backup is traffic going north towards Franklin rd).  It seems that the new lights are very short north to south and the ability to now turn left at bunts rd onto Franklin has caused the backup in traffic.  The backup in traffic is at its worst from 4:30 pm to 7:30 pm Monday through Friday.  Being a home owner for the last 10 years on Bunts rd between Madison and Franklin I can attest that the traffic issues have never been as bad as they are now.  It has caused problems getting in and out of driveways and just unnecessary backup in traffic.

As of 6:45 a.m., there's a lot of traffic, making it especially dangerous to cross Clifton Blvd.  The only option is to cross half the street at a time and make a break for it
and run when there's a partial break in traffic.
I'd like to see the traffic signals respond with walk/don't walk signals during "non-peak" hours prior to 7 a.m.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> As a resident of Beach Avenue, a rider of the 55 RTA bus and regular walker, I have noticed that the cross walk signals at the intersection of Clifton Boulevard and Cove Avenue appear to be malfunctioning.  The time to cross Clifton had been 18 seconds; now it is 12 or even 10 seconds.  Frequently all the walk symbols
are at 'do not walk', even when there is clearly a green light on the opposite intersection and adequate time to cross.  I first noticed this ~2 weeks ago.

<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Clifton at RRiver Bridge<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> Intersection of Lake Road (Lakewood) and Clifton Blvd (just before the Rocky River Bridge.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> If one is driving west on Lake through Clifton Park and gets to the intersection of Lake Rd and Clifton Blvd, there is a stoplight, and a sign that seems to indicate "No Right Turn between 4:00 pm and 6:30 pm." Unlike other "no turn on red between x and y time," this sign has a red X indicating you cannot turn right -- whether the light is red or green. Confusing! Taken literally, even if you have a green light going on Lake, you can't take a right turn onto Clifton? As I was on Clifton the other day 5:00 pm headed west waiting for a red light at this intersection, I saw a car turn right from Lake onto Clifton (going west), seemingly in violation of this sign. Right behind that car was a Lakewood police car that turned left onto Clifton. So I am thinking this "No Right Turn" sign doesn't mean what it says. Please clarify. Thank you.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Just a comment really.

I got my first parking ticket today in Lakewood. 

Middle of the day, empty parking lot, supporting local business. Do you really need to ticket people so aggressively? 

We Paid for 30 minutes and were probably maximum of 5 minutes over.

Where we were, there was no free 15 minutes. 

Also I think it is really deceptive to only include the 72 hour rule in small print on the back of the ticket. I suspect this is because the company you've hired to run the ticketing system gains far more from late tickets, which again I feel is wrong, particularly as older people will struggle to read the small print. And finally, why if you mail your ticket does it go to California?

PJE 6222<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> Reckless and drunk driver, with license plate PJE 6222 in a beige Ford SUV, quickly sped around someone from W115th at a red light to turn right onto Clifton Blvd towards the Shoreway without waiting for an opening to turn right on red safely (or even the car in-front of them to move or get a green light). It looked like        an old man with gray hair and sun damaged skin. After getting onto Clifton, he was veering right to pass me on the right in the lane which usually has parked cars until suddenly jumping two lanes to pass me on the left because there were cars parked ahead. He never used a turn signal and one of his tail lights was out     (easy reason to pull him over, please do it, you'll probably find a bunch of empty bottles... or heroin). He passed me and we get to the Shoreway. He couldn't stay in his lane at all, half of the time he was several feet into another lane if he wasn't just driving in the middle of the two Shoreway lanes, he almost crashed into other drivers SEVERAL times, and was straddling the center white lines in the road. This was through several construction areas with construction workers walking around (reminds me of the construction worker killed on I90 farther east, as if you even care -- why would dead Americans bother you? you only care about     your orders, comrade).
I even noticed a Lakewood police cruiser in-front of him, I thought they might notice him swerving literally all over the road, but they didn't, not even when he was right behind them doing it or when he passed them and KEPT DOING IT. I even tried honking at one point to get them to look in their mirror and stop this
DANGEROUS DRIVER WHO IS GOING TO KILL SOMEONE; they didn't even care. It was a blonde female driving, I couldn't see the car number. Fat lot of good my taxes do to keep this place safe, and yes, I pay taxes to both Cleveland and Lakewood.  You don't even care, do you? as if you're even still reading this.
p.s. He went onto I90W and I can only imagine how much more dangerous he is there at higher speeds (if he hasn't killed someone yet, like a minivan with a family in it). Absurd and so unprofessional that a police cruiser had the chance to stop and arrest a threat to the well being of the people and they didn't. even.
care.
I bet you don't even care either. You'd probably be more likely to harass me for submitting this than doing anything to keep this place safe, hence "Mark Twain". Really speaks volumes to how I feel about my government, someone breaks a law and I want to report it because they're endangering innocent civilians, and    I'm more concerned that I'll be harassed over this report than with providing you the opportunity to follow up with me on this issue for clarity.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> On Thursday evening I was driving home from the East side and was driving down Detroit assuming the road would be well plowed and safe. As I approached the corner of Detroit and Bonnieview, the car in front on my skidded as the light turned read. I also began to skid and almost had to go up on the curb to avoid hitting the car in front on me. Even with an AWD car, I still narrowly avoided this accident due to the poorly plowed roads and slushy conditions. I know it cannot be easy to plow all the roads, but I was shocked at how many of the side streets were still slushy and barely salted.<br>

Visibility of pedestrians and traffic coming from the west.

This is a difficult intersection for turning west as it is and the positioning of these
containers makes it more difficult.  They are really not a pretty sight there either.

<b>Additional Location Details:</b> Building rented by Winwood Properties- 13702 Detroit Avenue commercial property.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> To Whom It May Concern:
I have rented at this address since December of 2014. I own a small business, a hair removal and skincare salon. I have a large clientele and a very successful business, even though the name itself is new and I am newly established in Lakewood, Ohio. I would prefer to stay in Lakewood. I love bringing new business to
the area, which I have since my grand open in January, and would like to continue to do so.
With that said, the conditions of this building have been touched upon by the Lakewood Building department, yet nothing was done on the part of Winwood properties. The basement is deplorable. Roaches were everywhere (dead, as far as I could tell at the time) and I was told they were "water bugs" when I moved in   and that they would be removed. I have since had to pay out of pocket for extermination, twice now, and will be doing so a third time this week. The exterminator took one look at the bugs and told me they were definitely roaches, and one of the larger breeds. I have had a roach in the room at my spa which clients are treated in- it was an indescribably horrible situation and I lost about $1500 worth of business over two days because of it. I have since seen more roaches upstairs. This morning, I hear from the landlord that they will not be paying for ongoing extermination nor reimbursing me for what I had to pay for already. To run        my business. I will not be renewing my lease for this Lakewood property, and I am very upset about having to leave this area due to poor management and unworkable conditions of this building.
Thank you for your time in reading this message. I am not sure if anything can be done, but I feel it should be brought to your attention. Sincerely,
Sarah Herbst Owner/Managing Esthetician

From the Mckinley entrance to Daleview until my house, there are dozens and dozens of huge pot holes especially on the south side of the road - for some reason.
I dont want to hear that there are worse problems in Lakewood.  I pay over $6000 a year in taxes and when the City began repairs to Madison, they should have known that the side streets will get extra traffic and need repairs.   I like to be polite and patient but my first more polite email was brushed off earlier in the  year with a "we will get to it..." attitude.<br>

On a positive note...the light at Arlington and W. Clifton has been fixed and works beautifully.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> I am concerned about the unfettered access given to the community race events.  Sunday's RITE AID "race" closed access from the Edgewater Drive neighborhood to the rest of the worldI work Sundays and had to wait for more than 15 minutes to cross the road to begin my drive to work in Legacy Village.  I had    contacted both this forum and the mayor's office for an idea of when I would be allowed to cross the road, but received no reponse.  I believe we need legislation to ensure that fair warning can be given when the road closure will occur.  The race organizers add asking our permission to use our streets and have abused   the priveledge.  A more accurate time frame foar the closure of the street should be simple to achieve.  Last year, I left my home before 7 AM to make certain I was able to get access, but I wasn't able to do so this year.
In the past month, I have been held up on two occassions within one month due to these event.  I would urge action to mandate access for Lakewood's taxpayers.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> I live at the above address.   I have type II diabetes.   I have neropathy in my feet and back, and thus I cannot walk very far without pain in my back and feet.   I do not have a car (for safety reasons).   I have a 3 wheel electric scooter which I use to get around and go to foster pool, the rest of Lakewood park, the grocery store, post office, the YMCA on Detroit,  etc.  I could not get around without it.  It is hard for me even to get to the bus stop at Clifton and Nicholson.   I mostly use it on sidewalks at low speeds.  It looks like a three wheel gasoline Moped (red and white), and thus it does not look like a handicap device.  You probably have seen me around town.  I called the Lakewood police department, and they said I do not have to register it like a car.  While at the part, a park employee driving a four wheel electric golf cart vehicle came up to me and told me I can not use it in the park.   I explained to him how the scooter worked.   I would like a letter from the City stating I can go to the park on my electric scooter so I can show it to park employees when they tell me I cannot use it in the park.   thanks.  you can email me the letter.   bruce committe<br>

But...you need to do something about those pipes on the West side of the park just north of the new playground. Not sure what they are, but they are surrounded by a chainlink fence.  Idea?  Put some bushes around them!  They are
UGLY and detract from all the great work you've done.

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Hermes Racing  indicated that there will be 7 races between April and Dec 2016. Thus, for 7 Saturdays, the roads of Lakewood will be closed  in some fashion to accomodate a private enterprise.  Do the race employees pay Lakewood  city taxes for wages earned in the city? Does Hermes Race Co. Pay city income taxes in
addition to fees and costs for closing   public streets  for a private use? Has the city worked with residents to ensure that the same roads are not closed each time there is a race so that only a portion of the residents must  bear the burden of  being a hostage while their street is closed for the races? There are only  52 Saturdays per year, is if fair that over 10% of them are dedicate to a private road race?
I look forward to your advice. Thank You

<b>Description of Problem:</b> I would like to request a review of the timing between the red light and green at the intersection of Belle and Franklin.
I have almost been hit by people running the red light as was my friend (almost hit) last week. The second the light goes to red, the other one goes to Green and I think there needs to be a delay between the two because people are constantly running that light! I know there was an accident last summer/fall but there    are also so many near misses!<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Hello Lakewood,
I'm reporting a serious issue with the excess speeds of drivers on my street, Granger Ave. I believe drivers are now using this as a route between the highway and Clifton.     I have noticed an increase in traffic since the "Cooling zones" were put up on Woodward and other close streets.
Drivers are not obeying the 25mph speed limit on the street and not slowing down at the railroad crossing. They are speeding too quickly over the railroad tracks and around other cars. Last week my side mirror was struck and cracked off of my car.       I am concerned for the safety of my child and other citizens in the neighborhood.
Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks!<br>

Lake Avenue south side after Cove intersection.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> Litter on tree lawns, and city curbs  -  plastic laundry bottles on Lake and Cove Avenues, general litter on tree lawns of apartment properties.
Apartment building on Lake Avenue after intersection of Cove Avenue, on south side has put garbage out, leaning against a tree.  Today is Monday, garbage night is Thursday. Are any apartment buildings on Lake Avenue, and Clifton Avenue suppose to put garbage out on tree lawns??
Are apartment buildings on Lake Avenue and Clifton Blvd. allowed to put little blue bags full of recycleables (that blow around streets and other trelawns) out on tree lawns??
IF Apartment buildings are allowed then in my opinion it really makes Lakewood look pretty run-down and trashy.  The litter around the streets and apartment building tree lawns really diminishes the motto Lakewood has as a "City of beautiful homes".   We moved to Lakewood from Cleveland because we thought
there were ordinances in place against this type of thing.  Our tax bill reflects the difference from Cleveland to Lakewood. Please reply to my concerns.
Thank you.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> If your recycling Bin is full and you have large cardboard boxes that will not fit inside period!!! I would like to know the proper way to discard them since I can't seem to get any of it picked up ever no matter how I try. I placed them along side my bin and watched as both the recycling truck and regular truck past by. I will not take the cardboard back from the tree lawn since this happens all the time. Your street should not look worse after the garbage truck runs than before it came. I will be taking a picture as proof. Thank you<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> This week I reported a problem via this Report a Problem page on the City of Lakewood website.  As of yet, I have not had the courtesy of a response from anyone connected with this website as to the receipt of this report or its being addressed.  Trash was placed on the treelawn in front of the Imperial House Apartments on Edgewater over the weekend.  That pile of trash grew each day creating both an eyesore and a safety hazard for the residents of this street.  I find it disgusting that no one monitoring this page has responded in any way whatsoever.  What is the point of having a Report a Problem page?  After reporting the trash on the street, it remained for several days and was not removed.  This is not the first time that i have reported problems on this Report a Problem page and received no response.   It is a shame that the person who is responsible for overseeing this page is not doing their job.<br>

Our home backs up to Clifton and I am fine with normal traffic but the amount of times people are going 75 miles an hour over the bridge is a little frightening.  This needs to be controlled and stopped with more use of officers scanning speeders.  this is my first complaint in 2 years of living here and I've reached my point.  Please call me or email me to reach a resolution . I understand the Clifton road project will be underway soon, but until then officers should constantly be scanning and ticketing these reckless drivers that cause so much noise and potential danger threats to us who live in Clifton park.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> The electric company came and butchered a tree at the back of the property. They left cut branches in the tree, and basically cut the center out of a healthy tree., making it extremely unbalanced. It is listing toward my garage. . Now I have to have an actual certified arborist out to see if it can be saved, frankly, if it needs to be removed, I will bill the city. Trees filter the air, provide shade, beautify our city. And these incompetant people just hacked, with no regard for the health of the tree or the possible danger created by their improper trimming. 

If you wish to tout Lakewood as the city of trees, you need to find anither contractor.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Fugitives among us with triple citizenships
Bassam,  Walid,  Sawsan :    ABOU - MERHI  =  Abumeri =  Aboumerhi
 
Those 3 people share same last name,  but forged it; they all lived, in the mid 80's till early 90's, in Cleveland Ohio on 2137 Bunts road,  Lakewood, but each one of those 3 mis-spelled their last name different in order to mislead the authorities. and cheated their way into the country in many ways.  They also cheated the local and federal government for thousands and thousands of dollars which were embezelled and wired to Walid Abou-merhi in Lebanon.   
Mr.  Bassam Abou-merhi, born in October 1963, father name Mohamad, also goes by Sam Aboumeri, now residing in Welland Ontario at 665 King street  phone # (905) 734-8890,  Plate #  BKEF 291,  second plate # CARY 749, 3rd plate CCLT 189, is the same person who escaped the U S from rape charges  in Cleveland Ohio Lakewood in the early 90's,  snuck himself into Canada as refugee (fake story) and lied about living in the US prior to that,  and used his current fake last name notice the hyphen was eliminated and few letters switched or removed from his original name   Abou-Merhi  to Aboumeri.  He then fabricated a refugee claim in Canada under his new fake name Aboumeri,  Sam.  We also have reasons to believe that Abou-Merhi's have connections with some terrorist organizations back in Lebanon, such Daesh,  ISIL, and Nusra Front. During which time he  fabricated few bankruptcies stories and cheated the government for thousands of dollars.  Bassam Abou-merhi or aboumeri  or aboumerhi,  was also confronted by immigration officials when he was caught pretending he was his brother,  impersonating  Walid on an attempt to mislead them that Walid was residing in Canada then, but actually he was living in Lebanon with his wife  while all the monies were wired oversees to their account.   Walid managed to get his Canadian passport while he was not residing in Canada;  they do have 3,  yes three citizenships . how is that possible?
In 2007- 2008  Mr. Walid Abou-Merhi  or  Aboumerhi,  or aboumeri,  returns to Canada for another month or so to collect his citizenship and passport,  meanwhile his account #  00442-5049291 at RBC in Bracebridge Ontario, had collected close to $ 31,415.78 in child tax benefits, federal / provi. tax,  and personal income taxes etc....  without even spending a full two months in this country.  It should be noted here that he attempted to enter the US where he resided in Cleveland, Lakewood Ohio  since the late 80's  and 1990 where they all lived on Bunts Rd.   He was stopped at the Rainbow bridge here in Niagara Falls for presenting expired documents.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> My wife, Catherine Riznyk, recently open a new business at the intersection of Cook and Detroit, in an office atop Rozi's wine/beer.  Business name:  Catherine Rizynk, psychotherapist. She called LPD inquiring about a parking permit.  No one responded, to a simple phone call.  She then called again.  An officer answered the phone, calling out to a woman in charge of permits.  Response was rude and non-informative, saying there are no permits available for Lakewood parking lots.  Hanging permits are easily transferred car to car and used for shopping trips, lunch, dinner and other non-business activities.  Seems that the City of Lakewood can accommodate a new business owner, who treats patients all day, Monday-Saturday.  Running out to pay the meter every few hours not only is expensive, it's disruptive to the nature of psychotherapy.  At the very least, Lakewood employees can treat city residents in politely in a response manner.  Still, that won't resolve the issue of a taxpaying citizen be excluded from purchasing a permit directly linked to successful operation of a Lakewood business.    I am Catherine's husband.

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Good afternoon- I am interested in learning if some kind of enforcement can be made regarding leash laws for dogs on my street. I purchased my home last year &amp; have 2 Boxer mixes who are either in my fenced-in property or on a leash outside of the fenced area. In the 14 months since I&#39;ve lived here, the most recent incident being yesterday morning, 5 dogs, off-leash &amp; Not confined, have charged my dogs and I when we are out for a walk. In each incident, I have been left to put myself between my dogs &amp; my neighbor&#39;s respective dog, which proves to be quite a struggle since my 2 rescues are very strong and, quite frankly, only     trying to protect me from what they perceive as a threat. I have spoken to each dog owner at the time of the incident and received an &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s so unlike my dog to do that&quot;...but nonetheless these situations persist and I continue to see the same dogs walked leash-less or hanging out in their yards without a tether or an invisible fence. The last thing I want to be is a pain the ass neighbor to anyone but I am concerned that one of these instances is going to turn tragic for either a human, dog or both.
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide. Sincerely, Nicole<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Signal has continuous issues for months where the Larchmont signal does not turn green when it is the time for Larchmont (after Granger goes).  Repeatedly several times per week, i am forced to proceed though a green light since I have sat there through 2 or more signal cycles. there is also a timing issue at this intersection.  Many times cars stack through the intersection (eastbound) making it not possible to enter the intersection or cross Detroit from Larchmont and Granger.
Warren and Detroit are also an issue.
These problems did not exist prior to the signal replacement.  Wasn't a study done to determine correct placement and timing?  It was not successful.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> When you paved the road (and thanks for that) you made it appear as if the driveway to our apartment buildings is an actual parking spot.  It is not.  Patrons from the Barrio and Roxu keep parking in the driveway apron blocking tenants from both buildings from accessing the Madison exit.  The police have been out at
least 5 times that we know of and cars are getting towed.
What would be nice is if you could paint a no parking sign on the pavement or cross hatch it so that people know it is not a parking spot.  Your wasting the time of the cops and the folks who are getting towed.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Sorry if this is a duplicate ! I filed one in other and not in the proper category.

At 6:40 PM on 8/16/2017 a manhole cover was removed and flipped over next to the hole. There were no cones or markings to indicate work or a road hazard. I struck the cover and did potential damage to my car (2016 Focus).  Today at 1:15 There was a white van parked at the location (with cones ) and working in the manhole. I have attached a picture.  The van was marked CT engineers, architects and consultants.  This created a dangerous situation for rush hour. I was wondering if I could make a claim if there is damage to my car.  Thanks for your time and consideration of this matter.  Stephen<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> During this winter, with construction of a major addition to the property at 13966 Estill, heavy equipment including dump trucks, work vans tractors, concrete trucks, and cranes have accelerated the significant deterioration of the concrete roadway and patch work repairs done previously. In addition, the concrete work
supporting the catch basin, and curbs have also been affected. Once the construction is completed, scheduled for May, 2016, significant repairs/replacement should be undertaken.
Perhaps this project is already scheduled for future attention. If so, the schedule may need to be accelerated.<br>

<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Clarence and Athens<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> <br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> Cars and/or trucks keep driving through my tree lawn creating large ruts in the yard. I repaired one of the ruts two weekends ago just to have someone drive through the repair work a few days later creating another big rut. I repaired it again this past Saturday just to get up this morning and see someone had driven
through it again. This is getting ridiculous. What can be done to prevent this?
Sometimes I have seen large semis making a left onto Athens from Clarence southbound headed to the old Cleveland Screw building behind my house and I know that's part of the problem because the road is not wide enough for the trucks to make the turn without driving through my yard. Should they even be driving
down a residential street like that? Other times it's probably just bad drivers.
I have gone through a lot of work and money to make my house and property look nice only to have this happen time and time again. I have reported the damaged tree lawn in the past and the city has come out and repaired it by adding more dirt to where I am getting a little mound growing. However, nothing has
been done to prevent it from happening. Can a guardrail be added to that corner and/or something put up to prevent semis from driving down Clarence? Other ideas?
This is very frustrating!<br>

<b>Additional Location Details:</b> <br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> We have lived here for 12 years. This intersection has always been the sight of numerous accidents. Earlier this week the new traffic signals went into effect. As the lights are set right now, the green light on the Woodward side only lasts about 8 seconds. This is way too short for cars , let alone pedestrians who may be crossing....especially with Harding Middle School traffic. I believe this is only setting the stage for future accidents. Could this please be reviewed and hopefully changed.<br>

I find it difficult to relax with the constant buzz of their AC unit.  
Additionally,  I wonder how long it will take for them to side their addition. They've been working on the addition since last fall. This is an eye sore.    Please advise.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Hello,
I'm writing you to report a noise that has been preventing me from sleeping, working and ultimately living in my apt. I've moved out of my apartment which I'm still paying for because of a loud chiller noise that has been present for he past 3+ months. I've emailed management numerous times throughout the past several months and have not seen any progress in a fix. This is something that is truly unacceptable and is something I would've thought $1400 a month would pay for. The manager, Ed will not longer respond to me and has given me every excuse in the book as to why it hasn't been fixed yet. I would like someone to  look into this and assist in getting his issue resolved. This is not only impacting me, but also others in he building.
Please call me with any questions. Thanks,
Pat<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Our neighbors decided to keep their original sidewalk pieces when the sidewalk repair program came through this past summer. The pieces were placed in the front yard and have been there since. I asked for them to be moved when they decided to keep them. They said they would get a dolly and move them to the back. Thing is, they're both over 70 and their backyard is full of junk too. They regularly drag large items from other people's trash on the street back t o their house. The neighbor on the other side said he can see into the house and the first floor is completely full of "stuff". The garage is also packed to capacity. If there is something that can be done about this I would appreciate it. The house is a fire hazard and is about six feet from my home on the south side.<br>

<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Detroit<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> South portion of Lakeland, near Detroit (right by the CVS), was totally blocked off because of an incident sometime around<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> It's understandable that sometimes police work causes streets to get closed down, however, a couple of suggestions:
1. If the officers have to shut a section of a street down to the extent that it makes it impassable to cars and pedestrian traffic, perhaps they should put up some kind of notification at the top and bottom of that street, well prior to the actual area that is shut down, so that people don't waste their time trying to get      down that street to get to where they need to go, and can find an alternate route right off the bat. In my case, this led to me having to turn around and walk all the way back down the Lakeland to Hilliard to go down another side street after having already walked almost half a mile to get down to Lakeland and Detroit, causing me to miss my bus and be late for work. If there had been a sign or some kind of notification at Lakeland and Hilliard, I could have chosen to go down Arthur or Summit instead, and caught my bus and been on time. This also would save people from driving down that street, only to have to turn around,   potentially causing traffic back ups and accidents.
2. Please please please provide your officers some kind of memo or training discouraging them from telling pedestrians that their best option to get around the closure is to cut through someone's backyard (private property, I might add) at 5:15 am in the pitch black. Why he would have thought that was a safe and good option is beyond me.<br>

Currently there a couple of 2 x 4’s attempting to keep the house from collapsing into the street. This has been going on for over a year. If this isn’t corrected the house is going to collapse. This would likely kill anyone close by. Please look into this as it’s a MAJOR hazard. My son and granddaughter live on this street and walk past this area. Thank you<br>

The two houses on either side of me have birds living in their roofs.

I hear though there are circumstances that it isn't necessary.  Dirt and large earth/tree elements are flying through the air to the apartment across the street into our windows.
It would be beneficial if a temporary, large 10 to 12 foot solid fence (such as wood) could be built as a border between the project and the sidewalk on Northwood to cut down on the fall out of debre and sound to the neighborhood, BEFORE any further destruction and construction continues, and until the building is
complete
People work nights here and sleep during the day.  Many have babies and young children that have been negatively effected.  Some of us work from home and the project is extremely disruptive. Please help make this project tolerable for the citizens of Lakewood, Ohio.

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Subject: Lee Fields - Incident Report Good Morning Peggy,
Per your request, I'd like to record details on an incident which occurred on Monday, December 19, 2016 in the rear parking lot at First Federal Lakewood.
Upon leaving work on Monday, December 19, 2016, I had the misfortune of a slip and fall on the pavement near the first row of parking spaces in the parking lot near the rear entrance of the bank building. The incident occurred between 6:15pm-6:30pm as I was leaving work for the day.
The excruciating pain caused me to work from home on Tuesday, December 20, 2016. Wednesday, December 21, 2016, I reported the incident to Patrick, the bank's security guard and alerted him of the slippery conditions in the rear parking lot. At the conclusion of the work day Wednesday, December 21, 2016 on went on vacation and returned on Wednesday, January 4, 2017. During vacation, I attempted to contact Ted Yorkievitz, however, discovered that the information that I had for Ted was outdated. Yesterday, Wednesday, January 4, 2017, I had an opportunity to speak with Ted both over the phone and in person to  inform him of the incident. At that point, Ted advised me to contact H.R. to make you all aware of what took place on December 19th.
In closing, I did not have any witnesses of the unfortunate event, however, being that the incident occurred near the rear entrance of the bank building, I'm thinking that it may have been captured on tape which perhaps could obtained by the security department. Thank you in advance for your assistance.
Thank you, Lee Fields

<b>Description of Problem:</b> On Wednesday, August 18th, 2017 around 730pm... I was driving home.  Suddenly a man pulled up behind me and aggressively rode my bumper beeping his horn and swinging his arm out the window.  At first I thought maybe something was wrong with my car and he was trying to signal me, but then I could tell he was angry.  He then started to creep up beside me.  This is a 2 lane road and the road beside me was oncoming traffic.  He pushed me up onto the curb and pulled up next to me and screamed "FUCKING FAGGOT" and sped off.  I have a rainbow Ohio pride bumper sticker on my car and I'm sure that is what caused this attack.
It was terrifying and dangerous.  I was able to take a photo of the car and license plate.  It is attached.  Plate was- EYV 4910<br>

This is a copy of that letter:
Dear neighbor;                                                                                                                                                   11/16/2015

2179-1285 Webb Rd
It has come to our attention that there is a couple of branches on your tree in the N-E corner of your property that may come down and damage my garage roof, or crush the building.
As you may know, there was a tree that came down and damaged my house from the North side of Shaw Rd.  This tree did considerable damage.  I'm sure you can understand my concern with your very large and old tree branches that are hanging over the garage roof.   We have spent a lot of money removing two trees on our property so our neighbors and tenants can park on the city streets, Webb and Shaw Roads, and not get their cars damaged by my trees.
Please trim these branches before they damage our garage roof immediately. This is the third request I have sent to you.
The City of Lakewood will also receive a copy of this letter.<br>

<b>Street Name:</b> Madison<br>
<b>City:</b> Lakewood, OH<br>
<b>Full Address:</b> Madison Lakewood, OH<br>
<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Lewis<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> Madison and Lewis<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> For the 3rd time this school year, I have been blocked by police and the construction on Madison from dropping my children off at school between 8:40 and 9:00 at Roosevelt (Franklin) school. I am not sure if anyone is aware that the drop off time at school is 8:30-9:00. The way to drop off is to drive North down Lewis  from Madison and leave on Franklin. In blocking our way, we have had to drive down Madison multiple blocks to get to Franklin and turn against traffic the wrong way down Lewis. We are given no warning, I have talked with the school and Superintendents office after the 1st occurrence and they had not been given warning so the parents are not informed how to drop children off. These are K-5 grade children.  The first time this happened, they were actually done with the street by 9am. Obviously blocking this particular street between 8:30-9:00 could have waited until after drop off. They have also blocked parents and children     from even walking across the street and forced them to walk back away from the school to another street and jaywalking across instead of being able to use the designated cross walk with crossing guard to safely get across the street yesterday. Today, they let some cars thru but not others so we were forced to turn against traffic and cause many parents on both sides to become upset. We are being forced to put people, parents, children and crossing guards in more danger with the confusion. All we are asking for is for the construction/police block to avoid that particular street from 8:30-9:00 and 2:30-3:05 or to notify the school       if this is not possible,that they will need to find another route for the children and to be able to send out notification to the parents of this change PRIOR to that morning. I don't think this is asking much. I am very disappointed that this has happened on more then one occurrence and no one seems to be hearing or understanding the parents concerns. I know I am one of many parents affected by this.  It is hard enough to be in another school waiting on construction to be done on our school, now this is happening as well. I tried to ask the police officer what I should do the first time this happened and he would not respond just  waved me on. Another parent who happened to be walking home at that time stopped to tell me what other parents had done to drop off their children. I have utmost respect for our city officials and especially the police department, but I am so frustrated with this situation. Please help us figure out how to get our   children to school safely during all this construction.
Thank you,
Colleen Forster<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> We have witnessed at least 5-6 skunks nightly converge on Madison Park on a nightly basis.
They normally come out at dusk.  Both my dogs have been sprayed.  The city has a outside movie planned for this Friday, August , 2016 where there will be lots of people.
These skunks come into the park and are eating all the food that is left from people having gatherings on the weekends.  They are not afraid of people. Also, there are juvenile skunks that scare more easily.
I was told by the Animal Warden who indicated they are aware of the problem but that the only remedy is lending traps to the residence to set.  I believe they should be setting these traps in the park on a nightly basis.  I am wondering why this is not part of their job.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Hello, my name is Jonathan Solymos, and I live at 18722 Sloane Avenue in Lakewood.
I have an at home job as a livestreamer. What this means is that I will play games on my computer or gaming consoles, and project them live for people to watch. As you know, there are some people out there who are out to be as mean as possible to others, for whatever reason, and there are people who try to find out
the personal information of people in a situation like myself.
Unfortunately, through some database leaks, someone has found out some personal information about me, such as my full name and home address. There is an unfortunate trend that goes on called 'SWATing' that people do to streamers once their information gets leaked. What it entails is basically, someone calls in      to the country sheriff or local authorities, and acts like the residence of the streamer has some type of hostage situation or bomb threat, or something of the like, which makes the SWAT team raid that person's house, while they are livestreaming, with their webcam on. The SWAT team busts into their house, points      guns at their face, as is their job, since they are responding to what they think is a hostile situation, and causes a lot of trouble for both the streamer and the authorities.
I honestly doubt that someone would do this to me, as no other personal attacks have been made, and very few attempts have been made to steal my identity, but it is a possibility, and I wanted to make you aware of it ahead of time. I live in a double. My landlord lives in the other half, and I share my side with my brother and my fiancee. I don't want them, or myself, to get scarred for life by some potentially hazardous situation. If there is any way you can perhaps email me back, I would appreciate it. I understand that if you receive a call, you have to respond to it, but I would like to avoid any unneeded waste of resources, and  also not scare my landlord into evicting my out of my home.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration,
Jon<br>

<b>Additional Location Details:</b> McKinley Ave from North Marginal beyond Hilliard Rd<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> The Lakewood traffic engineer is causing untold grief to hundreds of motorists every work day morning.  They did something  with the light timing at the McKinley intersection with I-90 that is causing awful traffic backups for working residents in the morning.  This morning (Oct 22) at 6:50am the traffic was already   backed up into Hilliard - mind you this was 10 minutes before 7 o'clock!  We have this planning monstrosity, known as The City of Cleveland, on our eastern border that is trying their best to make travel in, out, and through that train wreck of a city (where I grew up) a nightmare.  The Inner Belt bridge construction and    the mindless screwing with the Shoreway, prior to the Inner Belt's completion is the root cause of the problem
Lakewood's (or is it Cuyahoga County's) traffic engineer is only making things worse.  I can only imagine what McKinley is like in the evening on work days! Please, please, please help your working taxpayers get to and from their jobs in a timely efficient manner.
It would be nice and reassuring to see some evidence of our Traffic Department present in the morning and evening observing the headache wrought up us and then fixing it.     I apologize for sounding pissy, but this is just getting out of control.  If you don't believe me just show up there any week day morning starting at 6:45am!
Thanks!

<b>Street Name:</b> Newman Ave.<br>

<b>Nearest Cross Street / Intersection:</b> Detroit Ave.<br>
<b>Additional Location Details:</b> This truck parks anywhere he can find a spot on Newman. Maybe up to a 1/4 of the way toward Franklin.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> This truck has been parking on our street for over a month now.I am not the only one who has complained.It is believed that the person who owns it lives on Detroit Ave.He parks his truck on Newman when he is done for the day using it. It stays anywhere from 24 hours to 3 days sometimes.I didn&#39;t think a commercial    truck is allowed to be parked on a residential street over a certain amt of hours.I do understand if the truck is working on a house but this guy is not when he is parking here.It is a rather big truck. Not just an eyesore but if a child or animal were to walk around it the person in the street, i.e. another vehicle, that person or animal wouldn&#39;t likely be seen by drivers and possibly get hit. My neighbor has complained to the police before.They marked the tires. But the guy moves. But he ALWAYS comes back and makes sure to park in a different spot. My neighbor has also has contacted our councilman, Dan O&#39;Malley who said he would look        into it. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s being done about it, if anything but this truck needs to find elsewhere to park.
If there are any rules or regulations on this matter, if you can let me know an exact place to find this information that would be great. In the meantime I will be doing my own research.
At this time of my writing the complaint the truck is sitting in front of a side by side. 1427 &amp; 1425 I believe. It is currently 7:03pm Sunday, 6/26/16.<br>

<b>Additional Location Details:</b> New construction opposite to Starbucks on Clifton blvd<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> Atrocious to see how much havoc this construction is causing. Please go to newyork and see how they protect the street while constructing. So much of open air dust is liberated. This company needs to raise wooden posts and cover the sides of the open land with tall sheets or nets and work within the 4 walls. They cannot take one of the lanes in such an important junction. They have already made a big pot bike on w117. this is causing much distress to the health including asthma , dry eyes , cough , stress due to traffic , accidents in the corner when people turn.<br>

<b>Additional Location Details:</b> The area referenced is the west side (southbound side) of Westlake Avenue at Clifton Boulevard.<br>
<b>Description of Problem:</b> I feel that a NO PARKING sign is necessary for the northern end of Westlake Avenue directly adjacent to Clifton Boulevard. I commute home on Clifton Boulevard, and I have had to dodge cars parked nearly on Clifton Boulevard when turning onto Westlake Avenue from Clifton. I do not think that the NO PARKING zone needs to be large; perhaps one- or two-car lengths. This will afford a safe zone to turn onto Westlake and not immediately have a northbound car in your path. I believe the southern end of Westlake Avenue at Detroit Avenue has a NO PARKING zone, too, but I cannot confirm this.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> For years our street has had major issues with drunk patrons of Merry Arts. I understand this is the top-rated bar in our area among our city, but this has become a nuisance amongst our block. With very limited parking behind the venue, shared with other businesses including a restaurant, patrons start parking along our street. I'm wondering if they can't get an agreement with CVS to use their lot, but ideally, would really like a limited parking time/signs put up for street parking. Nearly ever night, especially on weekends, we have drunk people yelling down our street (probably to their cars) and just stopping in front of random houses for long periods of time. When we work in the morning, it gets to be ridiculous. Anyway, we're all very annoyed by the Merry Arts patrons stumbling/shouting down our street and would like some form of resolution to this issue. I also suggest the designated parking times/signs or using the CVS lot because they start taking all of our spots, making it very difficult for those actually living on the street.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> Garbage is put out on the tree lawns days before scheduled pick up. Sometimes it is the next day after pick up. The city can pull in some extra revenue if they would only reinforce their own policies/ rules for time that garbage can be put out. I thought there was a fine to be given to the abusers?!         I shouldn't have to look at someones garbage for a week! Lakewood is looking trashier and trashier everyday.
Also the empty trash and recycle bins are left out for days. Another policy/rule that is being abused and is supposed to be subject to fines.<br>

Instead of seeing flags hung i get to look at trash like mattresses. It is very embarrassing when i have people over. Surely doesn't paint a pretty picture of Lakewood.
According to Ordinance 1777.01  there is to be no trash  put out before 6:00 pm the night before collection..Property owner is to be fined $100 the first offense, $200 the second, etc.<br>

<b>Description of Problem:</b> I frequently come off of 90W and turn right onto my street, Glenbury Ave.  Often, I just slow down and insert myself into the merging traffic with not too much issue.  However, on 2 occasions in the past year, I have encountered a car who tried to slow down for me and caused a more dangerous situation where I had to
cut in front of them without certainty that they knew my intention to do so and abruptly turn (and not continue to McKinley Ave).
Remedy Requested:  I think it would be a good idea to make the yield more evident by placing two signs on either side of the yield, or turning this yield into a stop sign.<br>
