<b>Name of Hub:</b> Enova Sydney Hub<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Mara Bun. Sandi Middleton<br>
<b>Contact:</b> mara.bun108@gmail.com<br>
<b>Location::</b> Sydney Australia<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> Enova Community Energy is a Byron Bay - based start-up social enterprise in our first year of local operation. As we double our customers in our local region to become cash flow positive over the next 12 months, we are turning our minds to the model we will use to scale up in other locations. We will use u.lab to co-create a model for scaling up Enova in the heart of Sydney, Australia's largest city.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> Sandi Middleton one of our three Enova Community Energy HQ team members has done the u.lab program.<br>
<b>Support:</b> Support for how to balance participation from our 5-10 team members doing the full 14 week course and a larger stakeholder group involved in prototyping ideas is welcome. Also we welcome ideas for how we can use u.lab tools outside of official courses to support scaling up Enova in smaller communities later in 2018.<br>
<b>Impact:</b> We hope to develop our first local scale-up model outside of Enova's home region that recruits 20,000 customers in Sydney by 2020. Enova Sydney customers will be motivated by shared values around an equitable, community grounded clean energy transition. Pending our evolving cost structure, we estimate it will be possible to share $100/customer/annum towards community benefit projects in Sydney. This means that if the model is executed successfully, we will share $2million in profits each year in the Sydney area. We need to develop a framework that governs how this funding has maximum impact within the Enova Community Energy corporate umbrella, and consistent with Enova's legal obligations under its retail license. Projects in Sydney can include investment in community scale solar generation projects; solar for low income social housing; community solar gardens; energy efficiency programs; education and clear energy advocacy. We hope to use u.lab to co-design many other Enova hubs around Australia building on lessons learned in Sydney.<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> We will involve renewable energy stakeholders in Sydney from the community, entrepreneurial, local government and academic sectors.<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> I imagine the hosting team will meet fortnightly - unless more contact is needed. We hope to do this by skype to avoid meeting in person beyond live and co-design prototyping sessions.<br>
<b>Language:</b> English<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> Our hub includes three Enova Community Energy HQ people (two Board Directors and the head of Enova's non-profit arm where 50% of profits are reinvested). We have invited 5-10 local community renewables leaders from key Sydney sectors to join in the full u.lab program to prototype how Enova scales into Sydney in 2018. This group of 5-10 people will run some face to face gatherings at a climate start-up incubator associated with the University of Technology Sydney called "EnergyLab". We will invite 100+ participants to co-creation sessions, while the small group doing the course will gather for live events (possibly recorded since the start at midnight!).<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> U.Lab Hub Roma<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Pietro Bonato, Rachel Hentsch, Daria Marani Toro<br>
<b>Contact:</b> u.labhubroma@gmail.com<br>
<b>Location::</b> Rome, Italy<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> U.Lab Hub Roma was born in summer 2016. Four people (who had already been involved in studying the U Theory before then) brainstormed together just before the September 2016 launch of U.Lab 1x, and decided to take the step to create a proper Hub for the city of Rome. The Live Sessions, Coaching Circles and Social Presencing Theatre exercises took place at the CFMT Italia (Managers and Knowledge Community) Business School in Rome, thus providing participants with an ideal physical space for collaborating. In the wake of the 2016 edition of the MOOC, the core team decided to make the U.Lab teachings more accessible to those who had difficulty with the English language, so they created a full repeat of the course entirely in Italian, and shared it with a group of 20/30 participants Apr-Jun 2017. After that, the core team grew to a total of 8 people expressing interest in offering their support for the 2017 edition of the 1x course. The team is currently working to secure a suitable space for hosting the Live Sessions and support all the activities related to U.Lab in a sustainable way.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> We have all participated in one or more previous U.Labs and 3 of us have hub hosting experience.<br>
<b>Support:</b> It would be important (and useful) to share experiences in real-time in order to discuss common challenges and share best practices (eg: how to nurture participant retention and engagement).
Can you tell us more about how to create opportunities for our Hub to connect live with the MITx U.Lab? Please send info to rachelhentsch@gmail.com<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Here are the collective stated intentions for our Hub: 
- build a dynamic and active community in Rome to help people apply an eco-centric, holistic-systemic approach in their personal, social, organisational and financial development.
- facilitate deployment of the U-theory in the fields of education, consulting and R&amp;D
- introduce the Rome Hub activities to organisations (for- and non-profit organisations, schools, etc.)
- offer support and create networking and working opportunities for Hub participants.
- create value for the Rome Hub community and improve people’s quality of life.
- become a centre for catalysing mindful change in the city of Rome.
- connect people and organisations through shared sensing and intent
- cultivate peer-coaching and learning from one another through sharing experiences and insights
- facilitate prototyping and collaboration<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> We are working to involve BIC Lazio (Business Innovation Centre), a public startup incubator, to help host the Live Sessions and introduce U.lab in their ecosystem of innovation. We are also negotiating a location with Segni di Ripartenza (a coaching, counselling &amp; consulting Association) to secure a suitable space for revisiting the Live Sessions, implementing the other course-related activities (Coaching Circles, Social Presencing Theatre exercises etc.) and possibly create follow-on workshops and seminars.<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> We will take turns amongst us to co-host the sessions as a team. We are planning to meet bi-weekly with the participants, and more often amongst us for logistics and planning.<br>
<b>Language:</b> Mainly Italian (and English where necessary or appropriate)<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> Our Hub is open and we have no participation restrictions, except for location capacity. We will be involving people by:
- sending out news to our mailing list (currently 173 people from the 1x course and 77 from the Italian 2017 live repeat-edition)
- publishing news and  invitations on our Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1777866092498546/) 
- sharing relevant news into the MITx U.Lab group
- publishing news, articles and invitations on our LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/company/11246512/) 
- publishing invitations on Eventbrite
- tweeting from our individual Twitter accounts using the hashtags #ulab #ulabhubroma
- uploading videos on our YouTube channel: “Ulab Hub Roma” https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbvJpH-TC-YMG36pmiX5EUw 
We are working to create a landing page with video testimonials to better explain the U-journey to those who have not yet heard about it.<br>

<b>Location::</b> Dresden, germany<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> DresdenULabHub's mission is to pull in citizens (whether CEOs, politicians, workers, students) into a fruitful dialogue that shall be the foundation to shape the future of Dresden and Saxony (beyond 2020)<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> Yes, in 2015 we hosted a team of about 5-6 people in Dresden on a regular basis<br>
<b>Support:</b> - support in the form of feedback on the description of the DresdenULabHub (on the presencing.org site)
- engaging strategies where u.lab is seen as an unneeded extra effort with no clear and measurable outcome (examples, and connections with other Hubs that have struggled through similar challenges) 
- I'd very much appreciate an answer on my translation question in the Hub Host Slack group (which is still not answered) in order to proceed for the good of u.lab and the local community here in Dresden (where English is not a common language for most in the age between 40-60 due to the GDR past)<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Seeding a dialogue space for local stakeholders and citizens to collectively overcome the challenges that face the local community and Saxony at large.

The spark for the activities in Dresden around u.lab was set in late 2008 https://medium.com/@ralflippold/when-dynamic-complexity-drives-a-dream-a32c70409bf6<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> Government agencies and ministries<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> 1. No hosting team for the moment 
2. Meeting for live sessions planned (depending on number of participants), eventually as interest arises regular meetings 1x per week or 1x every 2 weeks<br>
<b>Language:</b> German &amp; English<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> Edinburgh College Hub<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Valerie Jackman<br>
<b>Contact:</b> valeriejackman@yahoo.co.uk<br>
<b>Location::</b> Edinburgh College, Sighthill Campus EH11 4DE<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> EC Hub started in 2016 and comprises members who are new to ULab and members who have completed the course more than once.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> Valerie undertook the online course for the first time in 2015,  hosted a Hub in 2016,  and  completed the Presencing Institute Foundation course in 2016.  She was also involved in developing and facilitating the HUB Host programme delivered in Edinburgh in June 1017.<br>
<b>Support:</b> Love and inspiration :)<br>
<b>Impact:</b> The intention of our Hub is to support others who have a passion or a burning question they wish to explore.  Another intention is to help people become empowered to make positive change in their area of interest<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> EC is an Hub open to everyone.  Different themes emerged last year including Education, Leadership, and the Charity work.  However,  if your passion lies elsewhere then bring it along and we can explore it together.<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> We intend to meet every week on Monday evening between 5.30pm and 8.00pm.  The theme of the Hub alternates between exploring the materials and holding oaching Circles one week to developing prototypes the following week. This gives members three options: they can partake in the hub once every two weeks to explore the material, they can partake on the alternate evenings to develop their prototype or they can come to all the sessions.<br>
<b>Language:</b> English<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> We will promote our Hub through taster sessions and via Social Media<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> Caracas ULab Hub<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Helio Borges, Marietta Perroni, Maria Antonieta Angarita<br>
<b>Contact:</b> caracasulabhub@gmail.com<br>
<b>Location::</b> Caracas, Venezuela<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> We hope to transform, using the "U" process, a land submerged in chaos into a land of opportunities.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> The three hosts have experience in two ULabs. This will be our third one.<br>
<b>Support:</b> We need mostly virtual access and support in order to participate in ULab training initiatives taking place in different parts of the world. There is a reason for this. Due to our country's crisis, Venezuelan citizens don't have access to foreign currency. Therefore, it is impossible for us to travel to, or pay the fees required to participate on those initiatives. We'll appreciate very much any effort that you could make in helping us to integrate more with the ULab community worldwide.<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Venezuela is a country submerged into a deep political, economical, and humanitarian crisis. All the acupuncture points that Otto Scharmer has signaled for the world, require major surgery in this country urgently. We are planting the seeds for the country's recovery based in one premise. "Venezuela is one of the world's countries with most potential for growth in the next 5 to ten years. Our aim is to use the Theory U principles and practices to guide that growth with an open mind, heart and will."<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> We are focusing on training trainers in the education and social fields<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> We are a hosting team of three people, and we are planning to meet weekly, at least at the beginning of the course.<br>
<b>Language:</b> Spanish<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> We are inviting 25 people in this experience, mostly professors from the Universidad Metropolitana in Caracas and social change makers from the Caracas communities<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> Sanca Hub (São Carlos, Brazil)<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Pedro Paro<br>
<b>Contact:</b> pedro@trustin.com.br<br>
<b>Location::</b> São Carlos City (SP, Brazil)<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> We connect the city's key stakeholders to foster a social transformation of our ecosystem - involving innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> Yes, in 2016. And also participated and conducted immersion sessions.<br>
<b>Support:</b> Personally, I have doubts about whether I should introduce (or not) other tools along the way, in order to contribute to the evolution of the group. 

For example, I am in doubt if I should include some Design Thinking tools, especially at the time of prototyping (rising U). My doubt arises because I have a group of people with a high analytical capacity and who feel comfortable with some of these tools, so I believe they can contribute to the prototyping that will emerge in the rise of the U. What do you think of this?

Another question I have is whether, from the outset, we should modify the exercises a little or not. For example, will we focus on the "future of education", so could we do some (or many) exercises focusing on education? What do you suggest in this regard?

I believe that this may be a key point if the initiatives are intended to make a positive impact. I have seen many Hubs only "down the U", but losing power or failing to complete the "U-climb". My perception is that there may be a certain misalignment of intentions during the descent, and then a high degree of abstraction, causing people to lose some energy in the final stage.

Oh!! I would also like to share that I have already started translating the U Theory Manual (presented in the last course), I am translating the entire manual from English to Portuguese. This was the main complaint of the Brazilians last year. Once I'm done, should I contact the Presence Institute?<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Our intention is to work "The Future of Education" in the context of the Sanca Hub ecosystem, with a focus on innovation, technology and entrepreneurship. We want to bring Universities closer to Startups, as well as contributing to a reinvention of the Brazilian education system. We believe this is the best way to transform our country.<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> Multi-stakeholders: governance, education, startups, investors, university students, alumni, entrepreneurs, co-working spaces and institutes.<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> We intend to make 8 to 10 meetings, on a fortnightly basis, just after the videos are released, with the intention of practicing the suggested tools. We intend to do the live sessions together, but the schedule does not always favor here in Brazil.<br>
<b>Language:</b> Portuguese (brazilian)<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> Our Hub is Open. We have already had an immersion action to develop a collective ecosystem evolution plan, involving more than 100 stakeholders. Now I'm afraid of having about 20 to 30 people during the complete Hub. 
We have already done a live session on facebook introducing Theory U, with visualization of more than 400 people.<br>

<b>Name of Host:</b> Maurizio Giacobbe, Monica Moschei<br>
<b>Contact:</b> mau.giacobbe@gmail.com<br>
<b>Location::</b> Cisternino di Città, Livorno, Italy<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> We will start a little late because the building Cisternino di Città) will be opened on 29th.  September so we won't be able to follow the course properly but start a new adventure which carries on from our first project Cisternino2020 (2008-9) and from the ulab journeys we have already started in the local government 2015-2017.  Our first prototype included the opening of Cisternino di Città.<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> One host has followed the course on-line 3 times and been on the Berlin program + the Edinburgh hub host meeting.  He is an expert in system dynamics and has coached three different groups in the Ulab within local government. He is also a volleyball coach. He has read Senge, Schein, Scharmer and much else... Another has attended the Berlin meeting and followed one course on line.<br>
<b>Support:</b> First of all send us much energy on 29th September when we will try to interweave the various threads of our experience together.  We have asked Kenneth Hogg (Scottish Ulab) and Simoon Fransen (Presencing Institute) to come and see us when we have started the weaving...<br>
<b>Impact:</b> We want to introduce the U as a mode of governance in all sectors in the city (gradually "un pò alla volta").  In 2006 we did a workshop on the creative management of conflict and then developed this during the year long Cisternino2020 project.  There are many seeds to water.  We will see.  It is already a little miracle that Cisternino di Città is opening and this is thanks to the tenacity of the Deputy Mayor who came on the Berlin program in June 2016 and went to the Edinburgh hub meeting in June this year.  She has understood the U and used it in her new style of coordination between administrators, experts and politicians in order to open the building and name it - the place of participation.  Wish us luck!<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> Cisternino di Città is dedicated to participation.  We hope to gradually involve schools, restaurants, farmers since there is already a project of this sort and to meet up again with those who were young 10 years ago and now have families.  In 2007 artists, businesses, teachers were involved.<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> XJTLU Social Learning Hub<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> Beatriz Carrillo Garcia, Ellen Touchstone and Halis Sak<br>
<b>Contact:</b> Beatriz.Carrillo@xjtlu.edu.cn<br>
<b>Location::</b> At Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> Focused at students, their research projects and future careers. We also want to explore creating new spaces for interaction and learning within the university setting<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> I did u.lab last year (2016) and joined a virtual coaching circle, but didn't finish all the components of the course. I've attended a couple of u.lab events in Shanghai since, one on SPT and another one on u.lab theory and its application here in China<br>
<b>Support:</b> Ideas, ability to ask for other's experiences running hubs, I guess we'll find out what support we need as we start running the hub<br>
<b>Impact:</b> We haven't yet done so! We plan to meet on the 20th of Sept. to do so.<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> We invited students, academics, professional staff and some local charity organizations, but given that we are hosting the hub in English (we're an English speaking uni), we have thus far had no community participation<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> We do have a hosting team of 3. Our intention is to meet fortnightly. We won't meet for the live sessions as they start quite late for us (i think it'll be midnight here)<br>
<b>Language:</b> We'll be holding the hub meetings in English, but we are happy for participants to run their coahcing circles in Chinese if they prefere to do so<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> We invited students, staff and community through e-mail notifications and WeChat messages. We also did short presentations in classes to promote our taster session, which we held on 6 Sept. We had about 27 participants, mainly students and a few staff members. I think the taster session was really key to getting students to sign up for the course and the hub. Thus far we have 15 people who have committed to join. Because we have a small grant from the university to run the hub, we are also offering 6 scholarships for students who would like to pursue the edX certificate. That's was also a big draw for students.<br>

<b>Name of Hub:</b> Mid Wester Ross ULab<br>
<b>Name of Host:</b> GALE community centre UHI<br>
<b>Contact:</b> Kfrediani@nts.org.uk<br>
<b>Location::</b> The GALE Centre, Achtercairn, Gairloch, Wester Ross, IV21 2BH<br>
<b>Description of your Hub:</b> The group has come together to cooperate and explore how collaboration and new learning can help to shape resilient solutions to challenges in Mid Wester Ross. Key themes are health &amp; wellbeing; sustainable land use and economic resilience<br>
<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> One person Kevin Frediani in 2015 in Exeter Devon<br>
<b>Support:</b> To know your there as we embark on the collaborative will to be open to change who we are and what we do<br>
<b>Impact:</b> The initial hub of Mid Wester Ross is a formative group to build the foundation group in the heart of the community through aligning ULab with the GALE, or Gairloch and Loch Ewe Action forum. This is an extant and thriving community owned and managed charitable development company. Its key aim is to develop and improve the way of life and standard of living in the Gairloch and Loch Ewe area of Wester Ross. This involves working with a range of community groups and volunteers to develop sustainable community projects that tackle important issues within our community, such as improving the social life, the local economy and the environment<br>
<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> Initial hub is to form a core group that develop a vision and gain the confidence to take forward the core themes with a wider community of practice and interest in 2018. Mid Wester Toss is a community on the edge, nestled in an extreme landscape between mountain and sea in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. An aging population, loss of former employment opportunities that took the last wild harvest from land and sea it has been exploited and is now enjoyed for the beauty of a degraded landscape devoid of the people it once supported. Tourism from NC500 bring oppourtunity while influx of attention results in displacement of affordable housing to incoming retirees and second home owners seeking tranquility from a busily life elsewhere. A dichotomy as the young leave to seek oppourtunity and the basis of community shifts. Lots of issues and oppourtunities that require collective solutions and sit on an emergent path we hope to uncover<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> Fortnightly meetings based on live sessions and time after to reflect and discuss. We have established a hub intranet and plan to use this to share learning and develop capacity together over the initial phases. The hope is that the hub intranet will then form basis for wider lartipation and enquiry as we embrace the needs, wants and desires of the wider community<br>
<b>Language:</b> English<br>
<b>How you will go about involving people:</b> Initially we are a focus group who have committed to explore how we will align with and help better enable work that has already been identified going on in community as part of a Asset based approach to community development.<br>

<b>Support:</b> Please forward any u.lab 1.x participant living in or near The Hague to my hub - especially those who can't join Rijkshub as Rijkshub is exclusively for civil servants. Continue the hub host newsletter and the hub host calls, though I can't promise to attend the latter everytime. Provide some support to Maggie's Playground. React with a like on my Facebook postings. And, I still do not understand everything, for example 'Action Learning' - that is still a concept that is vague to me.<br>

<b>Whom do you hope to involve?:</b> For any participant of U.lab 1.x starting September 14th, 2017 and living in or near The Hague. Biweekly evening sessions, starting Thursday September 28th. Hub language most likely Dutch. Civil servants are encouraged to join Rijkshub.<br>
<b>Some other practical aspects:</b> Biweekly sessions starting from Thursday September 28th until December 21st. Intention to co-create sessions with the participants. Any participant can be co-host.<br>

<b>The Hosts previous experience of U.Lab:</b> A few have, a few haven't, but we all participated in the Presencing Foundation Programm<br>
<b>Support:</b> We want to be in touch with the other hubs and their hosts in The Netherlands. We are planning to host two meetings in the Netherlands, one during the MOOC, one in the beginning of 2018, where we would like to connect topics, themes and people, especially regarding to the physical environment. So we will reach out to other hub hosts to see how we can work together. Ideas are always welcome! And as a team we would love to visit other hubs.<br>
<b>Impact:</b> To answer the last uestion first, we will do both.
