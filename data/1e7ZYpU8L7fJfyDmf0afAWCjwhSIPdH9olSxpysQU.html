<b>Name:</b> Ni’zayah Saylor<br>
<b>Age:</b> 11 months<br>
<b>Address:</b> 332 E. John St., Springfield, Ohio<br>
<b>Description:</b> Police responded to an East John Street home on the afternoon of March 30, 2014, to find Ni’zayah not breathing. 
The boy's mother's boyfriend was watching her two children at the time and initially told police he found the boy not breathing in an upstairs bedroom. He also told police he found a copper penny in the back of the baby’s throat and removed it, but police said it quickly became apparent that story did not add up.
A coroner’s report found the baby suffered from multiple blunt force traumas along with multiple injuries to the head, hemorrhaging and brain swelling. The child also had a broken leg.<br>
<b>Case_Outcome:</b> Dorneil Cumberland sentenced to life in prison with parole after 15 years for one count of murder.<br>
