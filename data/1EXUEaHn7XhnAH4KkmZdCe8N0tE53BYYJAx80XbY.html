<b>subject:</b> Status of Gas Price Investigation<br>
<b>body:</b> Talis With respect to the investigation we are still in the information gathering stage. As you know we have retained as an expert Barry Pulliam of EconOne (sp?) who currently is in the process of reviewing all public information regarding gas pricing and 60 boxes of information from the prior price fixing investigation. We have also sent information requests to Tesoro Chevron and Flint Hills. After Ed returns from leave there is a plan to meet with the companies to talk about the information requested and to get an informal assessment from the companies about what is affecting the price of gas. Barry Pulliam will be coming to Alaska September 30 to meet with Ed and the companies. And as you may also know Ed was in Fairbanks on Wednesday of last week to appear at the House Judiciary meeting that was convened to talk about gas pricing. Let me know if you need any more information. also put a call into Ed in case he has more to add. Signe Andersen Chief Assistant Attorney General  Commercial and Fair Business Section

<b>body:</b> Dear Gov. Palin: Will you come to Texas for a luncheon fundraiser? We were in the Snow City Cafe this AM and over heard Jay Ramas talking about you and a vote to be taken this afternoon. We said hello and asked if you were in town and that we loved you-wanted you to come to TX. He said you were not smart and were dangerous. He said he would vote for McCain -but not you. What is his problem? He seemed like he had an unfair agenda about you. We have surveyed people here since our arrival and passing out McCain/Palinstickers (we had printed in TX) and they either really like you or love you. We love you too and will be working here on our trip and in Texas when we go home. God Bless Good Fortune and please win in Nov. Sincerely Barbara Dewberry

While all the Democrat intellectuals wonder where you came from Flat Stanley set off for Alaska and came home with the scoop which was printed in our paper on March 19 2008. Where may we send this news clipping for your perusal? I would love for Ian to meet you and shake your hand when you come to Georgia if circumstances ever permit. Regardless please ask Mr. Palin if he would be so kind as to autograph Flat Stanley we will enclose a SASE when we discover where we should forward the material. We like so many Americans are proud of you and are just ecstatic to have our families linked together through the Tesoro Iron Dog! LOL Cathy Bryan P.S. am not surprised Obama and the Democrats know all about pigs and lipstick they always try to deal in PORK!

Steve was seriously injured in a surfing accident in Virginia on Monday. He is recovering well in the Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury MD. Steve has always spoken very highly of Todd and his family. He has shared several stories about their fishing trips. I thought Todd would like to know of Steve's condition. If there is any way to pass along this information to Todd please let him know Steve is recovering and should be back to full strength in a week or two. If Todd would like to contact Steve the hospital phone number is 410.546.6400. Chuck Ward Planning Director Town of Berlin MD

<b>body:</b> Governor It's great to hear from you! There are very few anti's griping within Alaska but the national media is getting their first taste of AGIA and they WANT it to be wrong somehow. First the New York Times wrote that the gasline is no sure thing quoting Bert and Lyda as recent converts against it ("We're shocked that TC demands $500 million from the state!") acting as if you had said the gas was practically flowing right now. Recently we hear that a Newsweek reporter wants to "blow the lid" off the real story that everybody knows we'll never get through Canada and AGIA was all a ruse to get you to the White House. We'll continue to spread the truth and explain the ongoing battle with the Producers. We know you're letting people around the country know about what Alaska has to offer. Thank you. -Pat

<b>body:</b> Dear Governor Sarah; apologize for intruding into your email but need to contact your husband Todd and the only contact found online was a phone number which I feel is too personal. I am a member of a Los Angeles Adventurers Club which meets every Thursday evenings near LA and was wondering if Todd would be interested in speaking about his snow machine races and commercial fishing tales. We are a private men&#39;s club and as such are apolitical so we are interested in adventure and it sounds like Todd has had plenty of. There are usually about 50 to 70 members and their guests who attend the meetings. The evening starts out with a group dinner and then we all move to the auditorium for club business and the guest speaker. Please check us out on our website and give this matter some serious consideration. Best Regards &amp; God Bless... Fredrick Gary Hareland

<b>body:</b> Hello Sarah I'm not sure if you will remember me right off the top of your head but we lived in Wasilla when you were Mayor and our children Track and Marshall Bristol and Mindy went to school (Iditarod Elem)together and played sports together also until Track and Bristol went to Teeland. We moved back to Utah in 2003 after my husband's job in the interior ended and we wanted to get back to family here before they were no longer my husband lost his father in June 2007 so it was a difficult but wise decision. Belated congratulations on your nomination for the Vice Presidency! Pretty exciting I'm sure and maybe a little daunting all at the same time (of course mostly where the media is concerned!). I know you will do an awesome job if you stick to your core beliefs and don't let the social and political pressures drag you down. You've done well by Alaska so far it seems. I heard from Austin Bulawa months ago that Track had gone into the service. Good for him! Marshall is also in the army he is serving in Iraq right now left in June 2008 for 15 months. I don't know about you but it sure is scary sometimes but I'm so proud of Marshall anyway that he chose to serve God and his country because he believes in them. I'm sure you miss Track like I miss Marshall. I look forward to his leaves. He is now married too to a local Alaska girl he met in middle school while we were there. She has decided to come to school down here by us (at the same college Juanita Fuller attended) until Marshall returns to his base in Texas I think that helps us both deal his temporary absence for service. You are the only mom I have personally been acquainted with right now whose child is also serving in the military I hope you dont mind my feeling like we could relate again on some small level. How is Track doing?And too my seventeen yr old daughter Mindy finds herself in the same predicament as Bristol. So again I hope you don't mind if I feel I can identify with you in some small way. I know you and Todd have done the best job you two could with your children and encouraged them to make good sound judgments for their futures. We have too but it is in their hands now and we are left to support their decisions and continue to give them what guidance we can. Also congratulations on the birth of Trig. He is a beautiful little baby and yes a gift from God. He is sent as a perfect being to receive a body and to remind the rest of our hearts of our Creator and how He watches over us and to see how we will treat those special ones He sends down. You my friend have passed the test with flying colors and Trig will bring your family much joy! You are an elect and  blessed lady Sarah and I am honored to have associated with you and your family. My husband Mike and I as well as the rest of our family are behind you all the way. Lead on..

<b>subject:</b> ADN Kyle Hopkins<br>
<b>body:</b> Governor and Mike Mike as we discussed yesterday Kyle Hopkins ADN was trying to reach me to ask "how is state government running while the governor's on the campaign trail?" I talked with Kyle this morning and told him it was business as usual. Nothing has changed and I didn't expect it to. The Governor is like the CEO of a large company. She appropriately delegates her goals to the commissioners and we are accountable for getting the goals accomplished. It is normal business. He asked how it works with her traveling. I said there is no difference. For example Alaska is a large state and if communications are needed phones and email work just fine. She can be in Juneau and I can be in Barrow and when necessary we communicate. The Governor also has a Chief of Staff who communicates with the Governor on a daily basis and passes on any information to the appropriate commissioners. The Governor is engaged and in charge. He asked if I had communicated with the Governor. I told him yes she had inquired how the gasline work was going and is there anything she needed do to help. He asked what I said. I told Kyle that I thanked the Governor for asking that all is well that we were all busy that we continue to be asked questions about AGIA. I reminded Kyle that because of the Governor's open transparent process it is easy to answer AGIA questions since all of the AGIA findings were on the web site for the public to see. I also informed the Governor that the initial results from the Kenai River regulations she approved were successful. The hydrocarbon levels had been reduced from a high of 23 ppm in the past to under the standard of 10 ppm. He asked if had communicated by phone or email. I told him it was by email. He asked what I was doing right then. I told him I was attending the Governor's sub-cabinet meeting on climate change. He thanked me and we were done. Probably a 3 to 4 minute call. Tom

<b>subject:</b> RE: Request for copy of AST report<br>
<b>body:</b> Lieutenant David C. Tugmon You asked me to fill out a request for a report that everyone has reused to give me information on. 1. I started filed a complaint 2. I do not have a case number because Shanigan refused to give me one. 3. I've mailed request by email certified mail and no one will assist me. Offer Shanigan contacted me at Wildwood around 6/07/07 and 6/8/08. I know why everyone doesn't want me to have the report. The question is do you want to be a part of the cover up? AS11.16.110 AS1156.770 and AS11.56.780 one of these may apply in this case to the Officer involved in this matter? Now you ask me to fill out a request from without information IE Case Number and questions that would be answered by reading the report. SoI believe this is just another stall tactic. Because you are asking question I can't answer. So what would you have me do? Regards Keith

<b>body:</b> He and I have not had much time to discuss it. I gave a brief report of the following: We had a Working Group meeting September 10 with Comms. Hartig Hogan von Scheben Karen Rehfeld and me. _Ѣ Labor Contracts &amp; Non-Covereds salary increases have increased State budget by $150.0 by FY10. _Ѣ Geographic Differential Study will be done in time for the Legislative session - there will be budget impact. It was last implemented fully in 1970. Due to arbitrations and court cases there are disparities between union and non-union employees. The study will put everyone back on even ground (through phasing). _Ѣ Salary Survey: We all agreed it needs to be done by outside contractor not state. Last one took nine months. Can&#39;t rush it or no one will trust the results. The Group on the 10th concurred on this point. We will begin the work but it be done in time for the FY10 budget. _Ѣ We&#39;ve worked with the classification section to remove barriers in how we do classifications- I have offered to meet with every department&#39;s administrative services director and have met with: DNR Revenue Law DPS and DOT/PF. This is important because these folks drive the departments they know what the hiring issues are. I am in touch with the hundreds of hiring managers as well. I believe I have real time information on the recruitment and retention issues because I have constant communication with those who are dealing with it daily. _Ѣ We&#39;ve allowed more flexibility in Deputy Commissioner Pay _Ѣ Streamlined the intern program process (esp. important to DF&amp;G DECand others who use interns and try to steer them toward a career in state government). _Ѣ More departments are using the tools available to them: Law has switched to flexible work schedules (employees get every other Fri or Mon off and still put in 37.5 hours per week with no office closures public must still get service.) APOC is moving to this pockets of State government are moving to it and employees love it. The group asked that we have talking points and a matrix of what&#39;s been accomplished so far for them to be able to get the word out to their employees. We&#39;ll have that tomorrow. We have certain things going for us:_Ѣ Layoffs in Lower 48 states provide us more opportunity in recruiting for specialized jobs where we have few Alaska applicants _Ѣ Stock market downturn means folks who might have wanted to retire might decide to stay another year or two. These factors give us more time to get the impact of the geo diff study and the salary survey implemented. If you are hearing something from others that&#39;s a different story I will be glad to run it down and figure out specific issue. Thanks for the note.

We've received a number of public records requests and press inquiries regarding polar bears and predator control but nothing out of the ordinary (other than the number and frequency). You and I should probably meet sometime if you get a chance with Doug Larsen to go over possible plans for predator control this coming year. And there are some issues on the early-October North Pacific Fishery Management Council meeting agenda (like halibut charter allocations) that Cora and I could use your guidance or opinions on. But things are going well. Good luck out there DL. Denby S. Lloyd Commissioner . Alaska Department of Fish and Game P.O. Box 115526 | Juneau AK 99811-5526 907-465-4719

<b>subject:</b> A Difficult Decision<br>
<b>body:</b> Dear Sarah I've come to a difficult decision: to return to journalism. It's not at all logical - but rather a decision that comes from the gut. Being a reporter is too deeply drilled into my DNA. I can't thank you enough for the opportunity as well as the trust and faith you have placed in me. I have also enjoyed knowing and working with Todd. His passion like mine is for Rural Alaska. So I hope both of you will understand why I feel I can do more for Rural Alaska as a reporter.  It has been a privilege to serve in your administration. Thank you for the opportunity to travel and explore the issues - to come to know the fine people who arecalled to public service. They are so unappreciated. This may seem like an awkward time to make a change. But upon reflection I hope you'll see this as an opportunity to give the Alaska Native community something it dearly wants: an Alaska Native liaison. Your leadership inspired me to try this job. But deep inside I haven't been able to overcome the feeling that you would be better served by an Alaska Native. If you wish I can recommend some talented candidates. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted There is so much more I'd like to say to you but you are on a journey where every moment is precious. And have taken up far too much of your time. Please know this: will do everything in my power to turn this transition into a win-win. talked with Mike Nizich today about the departure date. I would like to stay on through the end of AFN. So this will give you some time to weigh your next step. Whatever your destiny may be whether it is to serve our great state or nation or both will always wish you well and feel grateful for the chance you gave me to learn and grow. May each continue to grow - and serve in the way that God would want us to. His plan is hard to see but feel a strong pull to go back to my roots. With affection and respect... Rhonda

You're doing great and people around the country are very excited about AK resource development. I hear that Exxon is attending the Monegan hearing(s)? That's odd.

<b>subject:</b> a sincere message for Sarah<br>
<b>body:</b> Dear Sarah: I truly hope this reaches you. Ever since I first heard as well as the Democratic critics attack your "lack of experience" I have wanted to send this message. The first time I was privileged to vote was in the 1952 election. I had just turned 21 in spring was recent graduate of Indiana and was anxious to exercise this wonderful freedom to pick my candidate. (Having been raised in a conservative Republican family might have swayed me a little bit.) I heard Gen. Eisenhower answer a question on T-V about his notion that he had the ability to serve as President since he had no previous experience other than the military. His response was brilliant and I gained a sudden feeling of confidence in this military man. He said "I may not know all there is to know about I may not know all there is to know about fiscal responsibility. I may not know all there is to know about foreign affairs BUT as your President I will have the power to hire as advisors the people that do know." Please use his quotation. Sincerely Rosemary Frankian a Republican P. S. If this Email goes through I'm going to send another about Teddy Roosevelt whose credentials you have in common!

<b>subject:</b> Fuel shortage in Adak<br>
<b>body:</b> Governor There is fuel a issue in Adak. The local supplier is refusing to extend further credit to the city for fuel. The city owes roughly $500000 now. The city and the supplier (Aleut Corp.) are talking to try and resolve the issues. There is plenty of fuel in Adak the supplier is just unwilling to sell more to the city on credit. I will look into whether either of the loan programs we just expanded with increased loan limits in the recent special session could be used by Adak to get through the crisis when they will receive their municipal revenue sharing payments etc. and report back If these programs or others are available to help Adak we will let them know right away.RandyGreg: Please let me know whether Adak has received its municipal revenue sharing payments and if not when they are due to be paid. Also please let me know whether the bridge loan program administered at Commerce that we just increased in special session to a $750000 maximum limit is available to the City of Adak. Also if there is any emergency loan or grant sources please let me know. Sarah: Are there any loan or grant programs that Adak can apply for that are administered by AEA? Randy

<b>body:</b> City of Adak applied for a $400000 Bulk Fuel loan on the 9th of September on the same day we asked for  additional information via fax to the City of Adak. AEA is waiting for information from Adak in order to secure the loan. We can process a loan very quickly if we get the information from the applicant. This will be their second loan with AEA the first was in 2003. We will contact the City again today in order to process their loan application. ' Additional information -TDX Power is looking into purchasing the electric utility from the City pending RCA review. RCA is scheduled to hear the case sometime in December.

<b>body:</b> Governor all is well thanks. We had an idea that work although staying busy would be be less demanding than the AGIA process. We were wrong about the work load but the desire and energy to achive your goals to get gas to market to take care of Alaskan's business are also stronger ever. We know with great pride that your work load increased also. The anti's are now saying the line will never get through Canada. That position will be destroyed by the truth of the treaty between the US and Canada TC's access position in Canada our and even the Legis legal consultants saying it will happen the demands of the market for clean energy the motivating economics for all including the producers US Canada and Ak and then even the Denali project is planned through Canada. It remains amazing how some choose to distort the truth. I call it lying. I have not heard that about Exxon but I know they are very interested in everything we do. As your time allows we will be ready to provide support for the calls to the company CEOs. Thanks from all of us for your continued support! Good news!! The initial results from the Kenai River show the new regs you approved have reduced the hydrocarbons from a high of 23 ppm to under the 10 ppm limit. Will keep you informed. God bless.

<b>subject:</b> Todd Palin does NOT belong in your meetings<br>
<b>body:</b> I am very angry after hearing of the increasing involvement of Mr. Palin in state business meetings and emails. As an Alaskan resident of almost 29 years I am almost in disbelief this seemingly accepted practice in the office and business. We did not vote for Mr. Palin and unless he holds an official capacity he has no business attending meetings and being cc'd on state business emails. I feel that Governor Palin is throwing aside common sense and especially respect for Alaskan constituents to condone and encourage this type of political behaviour: I'm so disappointed and disgusted. I will continue to monitor this development and speak out against this practice. Send Mr. Palin home and give us good explanation of why you ever thought this was going to be OK with Alaskan residents! Martha Toon

It means that if you're white rich and mostly if you're a big boss she'll make a paradise of your life but if your skin isn't white if you're poor and if you're workless or if your job is not an elitist job fact if you're just a subaltern or an underclas worker or something like that) she'll make you regret to be born! There's no change between that and W;prgramme. And mostly she smears and insults Obama all day and night and she dares to complain when he just answer and defends himself? I thik that if Sarah Palin was a man she would be proud to belong to the Ku she even may bring her Klan's white costume in front of the public durin' the republican conventions! Her belonging to NRA the is just a false pretexte for in fact racists reasons! She doesn't belong to the NRA to support the right of each citizen to have weapons in an aim of self-defence but just to support the right of every Southern white citizen to shoot all non-white people legally!

<b>body:</b> Good morning Randy. Below is information provided by DCRA Director Tara Jollie regarding their revenue sharing: "The City filed copies of their adopted budget and CFS in order to qualify for their Community Revenue Sharing. Upon examination it was noted that they did not follow either their ordinances or state statues in adopting the budget ordinance. They introduced it scheduled a public hearing 3 days later then adopted it even before the public hearing. One of the biggest criticisms of the city that they do things without informing the public. This seems to follow along those lines. Once they properly adopt their annual budget they would be eligible for immediate disbursement of $103068 from revenue sharing. In addition they would be eligible for $14912.03 in PLILT funds when PILT comes available on Oct 25th; Greg

I also wanted to make you aware that Adak has a loan through the Bond Bank that has a payment coming due on November 1st. The payment amount is $117375 and we will be requesting payment the week of October 20th. If that payment is not received the Bank has the authority to intercept state revenues to cover the payment They have not indicated to us that this will be a problem but thought you should be aware of this just in case. Thanks. Greg

Here's what I'd say: Anything from a citizen that can be answered promptly or referred to the proper authority we'll handle. Anything extravagant requested from a non-Alaska resident requiring labor-intensive research we must politely decline to provide. If it's an Alaska citizen we'll try to get it eventually but won't make promises on timing. How's that?

<b>subject:</b> RE: Checkin<br>
<b>body:</b> Governor Nothing new today on the election numbers that I've heard. My understanding is that someone either Van Flein or the campaign is doing a presser related to Monegan as we speak. I haven't heard from anyone exactly what has been said. Topics today: 1) Use of personal e-mail accounts. AP and Channel 2 have tried to do follows of today's ADN story which includes comments I made three weeks ago when I thought Lisa Demer was pitching a story idea (but in fact was secretly taping me). Per today's staff meeting regarding communications that occurred over the weekend we're referring the inquiries to the campaign. 2) Kyle Hopkins has been trying to sandbag commissioners on talking to him about how state government possibly could work with you on the road. Annette responded before hearing that we were trying to put a lid on it. Not sure what if anything the campaign is saying about this. 3) The tanning bed at the Governor's House. My understanding is that you paid for this. Some website is implying otherwise triggering various phone calls from the media. 4) Grace at Channel 11 wanted to know your feelings on the Knik Arm Bridge. I left her a voice mail message simply saying that you want a complete review and a public process. 5) Subpoenas. I understand the lawyers have a letter from you they're trying to parse. Anything to add there? It appears that Mike Barnhill already had sent a letter to Branchflower _�� in response to Elton's letter in which Elton conceded that the Department of Law interpretation that state employees aren't facing criminal charges is the correct interpretation _�� saying that the Admin folks would cooperate and talk. That has been reported already. Various and sundry questions from last week: _��Is it your belief that dinosaurs and humans co-existed at one time? I said I have never spoken to you about this. (There is an interesting reference to "Behemoth" in the Old Testament.)-What was your attitude toward the "rape kits" under Chief Fannon? (A former acquaintance of mine from Haines by the way.) -How is decision-making shared between you and Craig Campbell? -Do you have a favorite poem? I continue to be dismayed at the media. I hope you are well. _��Bill Original Message

<b>body:</b> Governor Per Greg and Tara Jollie the City of Adak can receive an immediate disbursement of as their municipal revenue sharing payment if they would just properly adopt their budget in a public meeting. Would you suggest a kind letter from Ms. Jollie to the Mayor of Adak reminding him of this fact? If all or part of these funds were used to pay the fuel bill Aleut Corporation may deliver fuel for the city to use again. Randy

<b>subject:</b> RE: Fuel shortage in Adak<br>
<b>body:</b> Governor Agency personnel are reviewing loan and grant programs and dates for disbursement of municipal revenue sharing amounts to Adak. The thought is that while we have not received a request from Adak for help we would go ahead and fax a letter to the Mayor letting him know what state loan and grant programs are available and how to apply for them. At that point the ball will be in Adak's hands as to whether to try and take advantage of the programs. Another factor is that apparently Adak is owed quite a bit of money in fish taxes that have not been paid and probably caused at least in pari a domino effect on Adak's ability to pay its fuel bull. We will be looking into that as well with Department of Revenue. We will keep you posted throughout the day.
