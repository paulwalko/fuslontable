<b>Council:</b> Curepipe MC<br>
<b>GPS Coordinates:</b> -20° 19' 8.814" S       57° 31' 33.856" E<br>
<b>Description:</b> In 1878, the then Governor of Mauritius drew up a plan whereby Curepipe was named as The village  of Curepipe.  During that time, development was so lest with the increasing number of population and houses, roads and sidewalks built everywhere along with the growing number of schools, colleges, parished, churches and other shops.According to some authors the word Curepipe literally originates from the sentence curer sa pipe which means cleaning the pipe.  The hypothesis quotes that travelers and soldiers in the 19th century journeying from Port-Louis and Grand-Port usually used to stop at this particular place to refill their pipes.  However, many other historians do not share the same views.  Some believe that the name was given after a late landowner in the 18th century, whose native village was found in France.  Thus there is no concrete proof to the origination of this name Curepipe, and this has remained a mystery for its inhabitants.<br>

<b>Council:</b> Grand-Port DC<br>
<b>GPS Coordinates:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> The Grand Port Savanne District Council and some village councils of the south was founded some 45 years back so as to enable inhabitants of the south to participate actively in the development of their respective villages. In these days, the Grand Port Savanne District Council consisted of only 5 employees. The village councils, however, had no employees.
It was not until the new “Local Government Ordinance of 1962” was launched that much more power was given to the District Councils, following which the Grand Port Savanne District Council established a development plan for the coming years. This plan at first consisted of resurfacing of roads, street lighting, maintenance of cemeteries, construction of village halls, creation of public markets, playgrounds and other necessary amenities affecting the daily life of the inhabitants of the south.
At present, the District Council has under its jurisdiction 36 villages covering an area of 515 square kilometres. Today the Grand Port Savanne District Council with more than 500 employees is an institution ensuring the development of the southern region and engaged in the improvement of the standard of living of the population in its region and hence contributing to National Development.<br>

<b>Council:</b> Moka/Flacq DC<br>
<b>GPS Coordinates:</b> -20° 20' 54.254" S     57° 33' 7.747" E<br>
<b>Description:</b> Flacq (which is a name of Dutch origin) was an area known to the Dutch during their occupation of the island during the 17th and 18th centuries. The area of Moka was developed with the arrival of the French in the 18th century. The District of Flacq derives its name from the region's topography (the name Flacq is derived from the Dutch word 'vlakt' meaning 'flat') and this inspired the Dutch in naming this large Eastern District.
The name of Moka can be traced back to the introduc¬tion of a variety of coffee plants originating from the region of Moka in Arabia. The name Moka was derived from the "Moch-a" coffee which was introduced and cul¬tivated by the French as of the first years of their occupa¬tion of the Island. The cultivation of coffee in Moka was abandoned in the first half of the 19th century.<br>

<b>Council:</b> Quatre-Bornes MC<br>
<b>GPS Coordinates:</b> -20° 15' 53.046" S     57° 28' 45.799" E<br>
<b>Description:</b> An ordinance, passed in 1895 and adopted in 1896, resulted in the creation of the "Town of Quatre Bornes" Now covering an area of over twenty thousand square kilometres, Quatre Bornes is linked by roads to the north, east, south and west. From the "Old Quatre Bornes" to the "Cybercity", the town of Quatre Bornes is at the same time residential, commercial, and industrial. The name "Quatre Bornes" probably owes its name to a map drawn by Descubes in 1880, in which he set the boundary stones (bornes) of Palma, Bassin, Trianon, and Beau Séjour. One historian suggested that the "bornes" rather delimited the three districts of Plaine Wilhems, Moka and Rivière Noire.  It is also claimed that in 1761 two land owners, Mr Mabille and Mr Desveaux were having land problems. Their case was referred to as "Le cas des Quatre Bornes". W. Edward, in 1921, explained that four boundary stones used to delimit the intersections between the roads crossing Vacoas and Bassin/Palma, and La Louise and the Balisage separating the land property of La Louise, and Beau Séjour. Some also claim that Quatre Bornes owes its name to a "commune" in France.<br>
