<b>Memory Lane/Feelings:</b> It was sad. It was truly a community spot, one of the last black-owned establishments where there was a sense of family both with the patrons and those serving. Plus they had the best grits and pancakes for way less than what they could have charged! <br>

<b>Memory Lane/Feelings:</b> I remember when Kawali Grill was foreclosed back in late 2012/early 2013, but I don't remember exactly when the building was sold and redeveloped into La Isla del Mojito, which opened in June/July of 2014. The owner of La Isla also owns Grecian Delight, housed inside the restaurant as the the more affordable fare offered for lunch. 

No one's steak and eggs will ever compare to the Kawali Grill's. It was the brunch spot for a lot of Filipino and API families on the South End. They sold Filipino standards like lumpia and breakfast. They also had Italian food.
