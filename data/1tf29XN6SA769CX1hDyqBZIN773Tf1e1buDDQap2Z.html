<b>Choice personal:</b> NetBeans<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have tried other IDEs in the past. I used Eclipse for a couple years, but stopped using it because it seemed to be a resource hog. I've tried Sublime Text as well. I really like it, but it is missing some of the functionality that I like in Netbeans, namely the function info that Netbeans shows when you hold the control/command key and hover over a function name. If I could find a plugin to do that in Sublime Text, I would probably switch. I tried Coda when I switched to a MacBook for my personal and work machines, but it felt too overcomplicated for my workflow.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> NetBeans<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> My current boss allows me to use whatever IDE I choose. Netbeans just works for me in my workflow.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have tried severals IDEs, but I always ended up using Kate. I think, Kate is more than a simple text editor thanks to its plugins like terminal emulator, class structure viewer and other useful ones. Although it has many features, yet it is lightweight. That is why I use it.

As for the IDEs I tried, regarding to my experiences, NetBeans is a bit buggy, and Eclipse is slow as hell. But PhpStorm is the most powerful developer tool I have encountered with, I really liked it. Then the trial expired...<br>

An IDE comes with so much more extra power that I'm willing to trade some speed for functionality.

PHPStorms main problem is that bugs are not resolved, while new features are being added. This will eventually make me try other IDEs again, but for now none of the other IDEs are better.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I worked a long time without specific IDE Support, later started using Eclipse but never was satisfied with the integration and finally switched to phpStorm as well as intelliJ for Java. As based on the same user experience this was a logical conclusion for me.

Compared to VI or Eclipse phpStorm offers the much better code completion and vcs integration. Especially there is no need to deal with a bunch of plugins all the time as it is with eclipse.

So far for now phpStorm is my PHP IDE of choice.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Sublime Text is a really fast editor which is super easy to be extended through the Package Manager.

As a developer since 2006 I am used to almost not touch the mouse. I type everything with commands, in the Terminal, in Spotlight (Mac) / Gnome Do (Linux). The Package Manager and also most of the features in Sublime are possible to be executed with shortcut command. I love this!<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I used to program on an old Windows XP machine where resources were limited yet I still used Aptana Studio which began slowing down the whole machine. I then bought a new computer (Windows 7) but soon faced the same problem, too.
That's why I decided to switch to Sublime Text since it's small and robust and doesn't eat up my resources (even though my current machine is fast) -- it's just amazingly fast, highly configurable and works everywhere with any language without the need of any setup first. I just love it!<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Fortunately, PhpStorm was the first serious IDE i've used for PHP and i don't even think of moving to another. Pros: easy to use,  cross-platform, functionality similar to other Jetbrains products (i do also use IDEA and RubyMine), lots of plugins available, also great for HTML/CSS/JS. Before that i've used Sublime Text (mostly because had slow laptop) and Dreamweaver (for HTML/CSS), but their functionality (out of the box, at least) is far behind from PhpStorm's.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I started off with Zend Studio. I am not sure why, but I have switched to Eclipse on a later date. However, to me, it was an awful application. I then went searching for a different IDE. I tried a lot, but finally picked Netbeans. Mainly because I was also writing Android and Java applications. I believe I worked with Netbeans for more then 3 years. However, last year I decided to switch to Sublime. The ease of use, the speed and the ability to extend it to your own hand made it my nr 1 PHP IDE.

Lately, I have seen a lot of people using PHP Storm. I suspect I will be trying it out soon.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have tried Eclipse and Netbeans in the past. I gave up on Eclipse when its PHP support got a little off, without providing a standalone installer for PHP editing, needing to install PHP support through separate plugins, etc. and Netbeans is a little awkward in its use, its code completion needs a lot of improvement. Although PHPStorm seems a little chaotic with its settings, after trying it for a few days, it seemed like the best IDE to stick with and do professional work. I also appreciated the fact that it's Java based and it natively supports Linux.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> The main feature of an IDE I require is good code completion/suggestions. I also value good user experience and support for recent technologies (such as PHP 5.5, Composer or NodeJS integration). Zend Studio, Aptana and Eclipse + PDT didn't meet my expectations, mainly due to user experience flaws (e.g. it was difficult for me to properly set up an SVN project) and later on, lack of support for recent technologies. Zend Studio was tightly integrated with Zend Framework, which I was using extensively at a certain point in my career, but I have moved on to other frameworks after ZF2 was released. NetBeans was a clear winner at a certain point in time, but it was late to introduce proper PHP 5.4 and 5.4 support, along with other flaws and bugs I sometimes encountered. I've been using PhpStorm for 3 years now and so far haven't found an IDE superior to it. Integration with NodeJS and Composer is exemplary, debugging with XDebug is easy and PHP 5.4/5.5 support was introduced almost immediately after both language versions went stable. UX is also very good and the availability of Angular.js support or the inbuilt Emmet plugin have grown to be features I cannot imagine working without. And I simply love the IDE's dark colour scheme, Darcula ;)<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I'm required to work with a very specific set of features: Angular.js, LESS, Karma test runnner, PHP 5.5 with PHPUnit tests, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, Composer, git. While I was tempted to use the same IDE as my coleagues do (NetBeans), I dismissed the idea after a few weeks. I'm used to PhpStorm; it offers me a familiar user experience and covers absolutely all of the technologies I work with. I'm aware that I simply haven't tried using other IDEs, but I simply don't feel the need to experiment when my current choice meets all my expectations.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Zend Studio (iirc it was v6) - feature rich yet UI was not as responsive as I would have liked to a point it was distracting.

PDT (Eclipse) - feature rich, if you put the time into setting it up to be so.  I became frustrated getting what I needed out of  it.  Also it was burdensome on my laptop, often being a memhog .

Komodo Edit - Was/Is a really good IDE, but when it comes to support for specific external tools for my development it was a hassle and ceased using it.

Netbeans - Used this IDE for a long while, but large patches or major version changes broke projects/plugins and would have to spend days waiting for patches/fixes/work arounds.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> The adoption of new features that support the up to date practices of PHP development is unparalleled.  The app is responsive, informative and supportive of the needs of a developer.  Of the few times I've needed support there was already an answer on the community forums or knowledgebase which suited me just fine.  Not to mention the price of a personal license is very affordable and a deal for what you get.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have started with Notepad, moved to Notepad++ and after that needed more. Eclipse was the way to go since it is free. 

After working with it for a few years I realized how much of a memory hog it is especially for big projects. I downloaded and tried almost every IDE there is for PHP. 

Switched to Zend Studio but it was early days and it was very buggy. I switched back to Eclipse and Sublime Text 2 (the latter being the one I would use most for big projects). After Zend Studio 8 was released I gave it another try. Its tight integration with Zend Server and the non stop phone calls I would get from Zend to purchase Zend Server drove me away.
 
I decided to give PHPStorm a try, mostly for the AngularJS plugin and good reviews that I read on the web.

Before the evaluation period I purchased the license for it and have been using it ever since for my PHP programming. The speed and wealth of features makes it the leader in the PHP IDEs in my view.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> NetBeans, current IDE fairly fast compared with PDT, clean and Free.

PHPStorm, I have recently started using this IDE on trial. I may switch to this IDE. It's impressive, fast, clean. Feels native to Mac. Has many features. Only issue now is the price.

PDT, ZendStudio, Aptana these IDE's are pretty much the same. Slow, ugly and complicated messy setup. The version of ZendStudio which didn't use Eclipse was much better.

TextMate, TextWrangler, Notepad++, BBEdit, VIM are not really IDE's, they don't have proper code completion. They may aid in writing code, syntax highlighting and some basic code completion. But they don't fully understand context.

Sublime Text is blazingly fast and clean. But features are hard to get up and running. Not much works out of the box.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Cost, if I can get work to pay for it.
Jet brains have put some good thought in how this will be used in a workplace environment. Specially like the ability to switch between different tasks, and it remember what files I had open and where I was working.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Years ago I started out with dreamweaver, which was handy for most frontend tasks. Eventually I learned PHP and switched over to Netbeans, I loved Netbeans and used it for a long time. I could do almost anything with it, and then came Sublime Text. I wasn't a fan of Sublime at first, I tried it and ditched it. It felt like it was more a frontend IDE, so quickly switched back to Netbeans. When Netbeans started using too much memory for the large projects I started working on, I decided to give Sublime another chance and used it for a week after setting it up similar to how i used Netbeans. From that point I never looked back, It improved my workflow in many ways, faster at opening files, searching, replacing, multi cursors saved a lot of time for me, i can sync my configs through dropbox and enables me to have the same setup across multiple OS'es. Snippets are so easy to make, and there's a lot of plugins and support available. I can't live without it anymore.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have used Dreamweaver since I started with web development and feel the 'Code View' that they provide makes the most sense to me. I have tried other IDE's like Text Wrangler and Coda 2, but none of them feel as comfortable as Dreamweaver for me. I feel part of it just happens to be because I have used it for so long, but I also feel like other IDE's aren't really 100% made for the purposes that I use them. A lot of them seem to be more geared towards a Java developer with the ability to do PHP code, or just a text editor with predictive type functionality built in. Dreamweaver seems to be the happy medium between the two.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I like Coda on osx but the lack of site wide autocomplete is a deal breaker. 

I have dream weaver too as part of my creative cloud subscription but find it to be so clunky - although the code formatting is better than Netbeans

I've also tried phpstorm but feel it too similar to Netbeans which is free - the trial period put me off trying but then having to decide mid-project what I wanted to do. 

Netbeans has been fast, powerful and great from a development point of view - it doesn't try to be a WYSIWYG like DW and enables me to focus on coding.

I love the functions list the most - such a simple feature but having an alphabetised list of functions in my current file, grouped by class, is awesome<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I started with Kate on linux and eventually moved to  TextMate when I got a mac. When TextMate went stagnant I tried several other text editors (Chocolate, TextMate 2, BBEdit, etc.) but preferred Sublime for its robustness, plugins, and cross-platform capabilities (as I occasionally have to work on Windows). I've been trying out PHPStorm, but I keep going back to Sublime for its speed, multiple languages, and honestly, my familiarity.

I'd like to get better with PHPStorm, I can see its usefulness, but its an investment I haven't been fully willing to pay into yet.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have now been using Sublime Text for the past several months. I migrated to Sublime Text from Programmer’s Notepad which is a great, free, and a minimalistic IDE. With that being said, I really loved using Programmer’s Notepad, especially because of its broad support of many programming languages. I found myself developing more web applications and websites and needed something a bit more specifically focused on web technology. 

Sublime Text is a great mixture of simplicity and features. I was originally a self-taught developer and I can say that debugging is one of your biggest obstacles when you start out. I started programming on Windows notepad and am thankful for doing so. Having to many features when you start, in my opinion, can greatly affect your learning curve. If you are forced to face these problems head on, you gain a deeper understanding of the languages you develop in. 

Sublime Text offers the simplicity of simple text editors with great features that speed up development time. So far, I believe it is one of the best IDE’s because it has a nice balanced feel to continued learning, and progressive technology use.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Tried phplobster and didn't really like the UI. Tried zend studio and it was really slow. Tried phpdesigner6/7 and it was good, but I found net beans to have more features. I also tried sublime but it didn't seem to have enough features. I started off 10 years ago just using notepad2. Dream weaver is just a pile or crap to use for a corporate website<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Just found PHPStorm not long ago and switched from jetbeans. We were having problems with crashes, and overall sluggishness with jetbeans, and tried out the free trial of PHPStorm. Liked it so much I purchased licenses for our entire team. It's really easy to setup, I imported some textmate prefs and color schemes, and it integrates well with Git. Does everything we need it to, and it's commercially supported.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I haven't use 'real' IDEs so far. For the past two years I developped with SublimeText (which is not quite an IDE but via the package center, can be sort of).

Recently I switched to PHPStorm, firstly for the look (I feel more comfy when the GUI looks great) and secondly for the built-in features, like GIT or Terminal.

It will be six months that I use PHPStorm and I don't think moving to another IDE soon.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I use PHPStorm because it's fast, and it has features that are either nonexistent or implemented less well in other IDE's, such as code style enforcement, built-in version control, Drupal integration, difference comparisons, and documentation popups. And I love being able to control + click on a function and be taken right away to where it's declared.

I've used other IDE's, but Adobe Dreamweaver seems more suited for designers and lacks functionality on the development side. Aptana Studio is slow, and its built-in SFTP client didn't provide notifications if I was uploading something that had been changed server-side since the last upload.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Very elegant. Has Vagrant, many VCS's, Javascript etc. support. Netbeans is clunky compared to PHPStorm and constantly reminds you it's a kind of like a "pig with make-up on" since it's always been a Java IDE. Eclipse has the same flaws. Using tons of mods to make things work is not what I have in mind when downloading a fresh new idea. I really like how "integrated" PHPStorm really is.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I find that Sublime text doesn't have the same weight to it that traditional IDEs do. All the things that can be helpful in other IDEs, like code completion for example, can be added to Sublime pretty easily with the package manager. The time it takes to get Sublime up and running is pretty quick, and it has been one of the easiest editors I have found to customize. This makes it something that I actually enjoy to work in. The only real drawback I have found with it as opposed to a traditional IDE is the support for debugging in PHP. I have tried Zend Studio as an IDE, but found the interface felt clunky, and the startup time for most of my common development tasks felt sluggish. I have Netbeans set up for the explicit purpose of stepping through the code when needed. This hasn't kept me from splurging for a license though.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I use both Sublime and Netbeans quite a bit at work, with Sublime being my primary editor, and Netbeans in a supporting role when I need to step through code.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> 1- I use text editors for HTML/CSS, like, sublime or notepad ++, (i will never use Vim again)

2- If i would pay for an editor it would be PhpStorm and not Dreamweaver or any other it's simply worth the money.

3- for me Netbeans is much easier than Eclipse. and i don't pay for IDE's based on eclipse, i think it's bad approach, like Zend, if i will use eclipse it would be eclipse with PDT.

-the winner for me is Netbeans, because it's free, i got everything i need editor, debugger, tools, plugins, etc, it's easier than eclipse, if i had the money i would go for storm, but there is nothing Netbeans can't do, it's the free version of the perfect IDE, and Storm is the sophisticated paid one.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> it's the best first choice, that is for work, but when it comes to paying money for software i personally use, i always choose free/open source, not because i'm cheap, but because i live in a country where getting a credit card is hard, so PhpStorm is the best for work.<br>

I like PhpStorm for my daily work because it lets me see things that nobody else sees and I can find and fix problems much faster. I love the intelligent code highlighting, integration of subversion, and the integration of many tools like code sniffer, file watchers (which lets you compile less files, minimize javascript files and more), and database integration.<br>

just using a few apps but mostly while we are writing codes, we open alot of other high memory usage softwares  such as photoshop and  a couple of browsers for testing and even web server. so, I like sublimetext which is so fast , low memory consumption.although it is a text editor, we can also add additional features through plugins, so it is so nice.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have used Dreamweaver and Zend Studio in the past, but prefer PHPStorm. Both Dreamweaver and Zend Studio are too bloated for what I need, and PHPStorm is frequently updated with new functionality. I'm playing around with Sublime a little as well, but prefer PHPStorm's full IDE functionality.

I also program in Ruby and Java, and use RubyMine and Intellij IDEA for those. It's nice to be able to use the same fully featured interface for everything.<br>

Tried phpStorm and I find that the trial is too short for me to get "used to" and play around with its features.<br>

I'll admin, there are many features that I don't use, but the ability to search for a file in a project by using Ctrl-P is extremely useful. I could be persuaded to switch editors, but I consider the two features mentioned to be essential. In other words, I can't live without them!<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> When I first started developing in PHP, I had been using Dreamweaver for HTML development, and I really appreciate and enjoy Dreamweaver for HTML, but after I had gotten deep enough into PHP, I realized that it just wasn't the best choice of IDE for PHP. I had heard of Aptana and tried it out. Since it's Eclipse based, and I had used Eclipse for Java development, it was easy for me to jump in and become familiar with it's workings. It has all the basics, FTP Upload on Save, Autocompletion, etc. An improvement over basic Eclipse is the fact that it has theming.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I'm not currently developing PHP at work at the moment. I'm mostly a Perl developer but I have several languages that I edit. I choose to use Sublime as it's more of a general use editor rather than a full-fledged IDE. I enjoy that it can open any file of almost any language and perform syntax highlighting. It doesn't have as many fancy features, but I feel this makes me a better programmer as I need to be more alert to mistakes in typing.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Notepad++<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have tried several IDEs over the last year's,  be it netbeans, komodo or phpstorm. And I am very fond of their comfortable features and integration of modern technology respectively. 
Missing one or the other of those features in a simple editor like notepad++ drove me to try out alternatives. Of what I have tried so far, phpstorm is my favorite. I learned to love its code formatting, the way it supports Phpdoc and its integration into frameworks, especially Symphony. And - on a more superficial level - I like how it looks and feels. But while it also supports me writing SCSI, editing Databases and debugging my code, I always came to a point where I felt locked into some kind of cage. For all off the pros mentioned before I have acquired specialized standalone solutions that do what they are supposed to do just as I want it to be over the years. Some of them I created myself, some I found after trying out lots of others. 
In the end, all that those IDEs where able to offer was delivering these features from one hand. While that could be a catch, I never liked the size and complexity of those IDEs. Not to mention the time they needed to start up. 
I prefer my development tools to be simple, quick and lightweight. And while notepad++ doesn't offer much comfortability and only makes up for this partially with its plug-ins, it actually is quick, simple and lightweight. And it plays perfectly together with the other tools that build up my whole development process.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Dreamweaver<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> At work we prefer to use Dreamweaver for several reasons. The first reason is we develop on both PC and Mac. The second reason is that we like how the IDE uses different colors to represent functions, classes, etc. There are many ways to configure DW to fit our way of programming. The third reason is the support for multiple developers. It has a simple check-in/check-out system. We would like to get into GIT but in our work environment, we are hardly given any time to research alternatives nor funding. We don't use DW's "auto coding". We build things from scratch using CodeIgniter as the framework. DW's "auto coding" is too bloated and it doesn't do everything we need. We mainly use it as a "text editor on steroids".

We have tried Notepad++ which is great but unfortunately it's only available in Windows. It also doesn't have an easy to use check-in/check-out system. We also tried TextMate, but it's only for Mac. Our close second place IDE of choice is Aptana. Not only is it free but does what DW does, but better specially when managing indentation and auto-completion of codes. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an easy to use check-in/check-out system.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Eclipse with PDT is most similar to Zend Studio, which have best auto complete in all necessary languages (PHP, html, js, css). Worked in Zend studio in previous company, didn't renewed license, and at the time PDT Extensions got enough useful to replace ZS. Also tried Aptana, didn't liked, had good js/css/html support, but php support sucks. Also tried NetBeans, it is better from Eclipse/PDT combination, but it is hard to switch and learn new shortcuts. At some point tried Dreamweaver which had the best context recognition and autocomplete at that moment in mixed content files (html, css, js). Also tried UEdit, Notepad++, Notepad2, Sublime, TextWrangler and so on, but they are just editors, not complete ides, and they are good just for quick fixes.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I recently switched to PHPStorm coming from Netbeans. I've had heard already allot about it, but didn't start using it because of the missing feature to load projects from UNC paths. Netbeans is able to do that by default. But then I found a solution for the UNC path problem - and no, I wouldn't want to use network drives/ mounts. Instead I mounted the UNC paths as directory symlinks in Win7 and that is working like a charm. That trick enabled the use/ try of PHPStorm - and although Netbeans is a great IDE, PHPStorm definitely wins the competition. Code-Completion and project indexing is so much faster compared to Netbeans.
It also supports new language versions faster or supported other stuff like SASS/LESS earlier by default.
There is just one thing I miss in PHPStorm compared to Netbeans, the ability to show versioning information in the project tree. E.g. Netbeans shows the current tag name of svn:externals behind the folder in the project tree. This handy feature is still missing in PHPStorm...

I also used - even still use for smaller projects - WeBuilder/RapidPHP. It's a handy tool and I was an active forum member and involved in fotmer feature and bugfix releases. But compared to Netbeans or PHPStorm it's more or less an editor than a full fledged IDE. But I still like using it as mentioned.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I started programming in eclipse, which suited me at the time.  When I changed jobs, everyone was using Netbeans, so I switched to that to take advantage of the knowledge others had built.  Shortly after, I switched to vim.   I had used it in other capacities before, and was quite proficient.  Working with vim was great since Netbeans is brutally slow.  At some point I decided to give emacs a try.  There is such a divide between vim and emacs; to be truly fair I knew I had to try both.  I quickly fell in love with emacs.  It is extensible, stable, and allows me to optimizes entire workflow instead of just my editing.  The deep integration with every language I have ever wanted to program in is also a huge boost.  And as far as I am concerned, no git interface even comes close to comparing to magit.  Emacs is an absolute joy for any editing task.  Clocking into tasks, working with my database, and more makes it an easy choice for me.<br>

Squad (squadedit.com) is cloud-based, so it's anywhere I need to code and I don't have to install anything.  It's super simple.  It allows multiple tabs and files to be opened at a time.  It also features a real-time collaboration function which I use for helping my wife and friends with their coding problems.  It's got a built-in FTP client which is pretty straight forward.  It also has a git client which I don't use very much, but I'm glad to know it exists in case I'm not able to access a terminal.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> NetBeans<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Worked with (3 years): phpDesigner
Tried to work with (couple of months): PHPEdit, PhpStorm
And why I choose NetBeans:
1. Cross-platform 
Windows, Linux and Mac loves NetBeans, so I’m able to work almost anywhere
2. Open source
If I'd need something exotic from NetBeans, I'd go to Java-developer and give him a task, which scenario is impossible in case of proprietary software.
3. Runs very stable
Every non-free PHP IDE I tried had various problems with stability, NetBeans runs almost rock stable, except of occasionally (no more than once in a working day) 1-5 sec freeze, like it’s doing something very important and don't wont to be interrapted.
4. An acceptable support for utf-8 and windows-1251
Those are two major encoding, I have to deal with. I'd add better support for non-UTF encodings, but what we have now is almost enough.
Of course I didn't try all IDEs (no time for them, time is money and when you see money don’t vast your time). As for now NetBeans works very good for me and my colleagues. It’s a little beat too much “open-sourced”, not as fast as some others, but it’s best for me.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> The editor that actually ‘gets’ your code and deeply understands its structure, supporting PHP 5.3, 5.4 &amp; 5.5 for modern and legacy projects.

Hundreds of inspections take care of verifying your code as you type, analyzing the whole project. PHPDoc support, code (re)arranger, code formatter, PHP Code Sniffer &amp; Mess Detector, quick-fixes and other features help you write neat code that’s easy to support.
Perform many routine tasks right from the IDE, thanks to Version Control Systems integration (Git, SVN, etc.), local history, support for remote deployment, SQL and databases, command-line tools, Vagrant, Composer, PHP UML, terminal, built-in REST Client and SSH Console with remote tools.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> The Netbeans license is owned by Oracle from its acquisition of Sun, but it is a free and open source IDE. Since PHP is now an object-oriented language, like Java, NetBeans has incorporated PHP into its editor.  You have a choice to install NetBeans with just the PHP bundle, which is what I did, since I do not do a lot of Java work.I highly recommend you download and try NetBeans.  You can have both IDE's running at the same time without conflicts.  If you don't like NetBeans, you can stay with Eclipse, but in the process of using both, I think you'll find yourself gradually moving to NetBeans as your IDE of choice.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Switched from Netbeans 1.5 years ago. Keyboard shortcut mapping made it very easy to switch, and proved useful later as PhpStorm does have some wierd ones by default. Debbuger setup was a breeze, as well as setting various codesniffs and linters. Lately, I'm using more and more database feature set, especially when annoyed by constant chrashing of mysql workbench. Refactoring is easy with pulling methods out and renaming. Wish it would be faster on latter for single file operations.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> PhpStorm is very stable. Lots of very well arranged shortcuts. Great features that really more pleasant and accelerate the work. Do not forget about licensing the greatest of all time. this let us consider the low cost of the license and get the best environment of any professional Php developer. I tried eclipse, but properly install the plugin to svn was very difficult, and sometimes impossible. In Netbeans there were various problems with the encoding. for example, when the project file was in a different encoding, netbeans replace everything at once set when creating the project. a large team such situations happen. The whole situation could be disastrous<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> In start I use Eclipse with plugins for PHP and Web development. It was natural for me since I come to PHP after years of programming in Java. It was good experience but than in one moment I try NetBeans PHP and understand that Eclipse are not so good when it come to working with HTML, CSS and specially JS. I was happy few years with NetBeans and it become much better with each update, but one thing that move me to PhpStorm is how much NetBeans is slow and memory consuming. When I give a try to PhpStorm I understand that its really the best IDE. I use it for PHP and also for advanced JS projects and I can say after year and some time of using that its really the best one.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PSPad<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> PHP development is not my primary area of work. It is ocassional (on-demand) profession.

Since I develop all my projects alone, team collaboration features were never important to me. In addition to that, source code control mechanisms were also not important since I do not have the need for them.

What I always needed was a lightweight environment, which is not trying to be too smart, with a good code editing and colloring capabilities.

I tried them all, IDEs and editors and as much as I wanted to switch to full featured IDE, I kept coming back to PSPad. It is quick and responsive, precise, and contains just the right amount of features (at least for my needs); provides great user experience and set of functionalities while being free from the bloat of features I generally do not need.

PHPStorm would be my second choice. Since I do not code in PHP as my main occupation and  since my projects are not too complex, I couldn't justify investment in it so far. I have used it for several times (trial period) over the years, and I really find it far ahead of competition for the same reasons I have mentioned for PSPad.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Before Sublime Text I've used TextMate, which was awesome (but Sublime wins with its package system). I've tried several full-featured IDEs before (PHPStorm, NetBeans, Aptana, …) and while they do their job great, I found them very slow (because of Java) and too bloated. So simple editor like Sublime Text works best for me. One feature I've used a lot recently — I've got synchronized settings, packages, etc. and switch platforms — I work with the same editor, same settings, same packages all the time. Awesome.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> As an ex-frontend-dev and graphic guy I started with early versions of Dreamweaver 10+ years ago, as Dreamweaver is some of kind of standard in web agencies that have a strong visual focus. My first steps in PHP were in Notepad++ (don't know anymore why I didn't use Dreamweaver anymore), later NetBeans, which I used for years. Then my employer tried IntelliJ's IDEA for Groovy development, and I was astonished how awesome this IDE was. This company also builds PHPStorm, so I tried and never looked back. My killer argument: PHPStorm is clearly made by usability experts. Everything is logical, easy to find and reduces your workload dramatically. It adds functionalities to your work you never thought of. It replaces most of the fiddling on the command line with clever visual UIs. And I never had one these "my IDE sucks" moments.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> IntelliJ IDEA<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Not a PHP answer here. My employer uses IDEA (because we don't use PHP), which is basically exactly like PHPStorm (built by the same company). The IDE dramatically improves the workflow, the quality of code and the way huge teams can work together. From a business perspective, this IDE saves you masses of developer hours, lots of stress and adds high-end professionalism to your project.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I've tried and used Codelobster, works great with html/css also. I've tried PHPStorm but at the time this IDE was slow. I've also used Eclipse PDT but had configuration issues and the IDE was slow. I've also used Netbeans and continue to do so but I usually go back to PHPDesigner 8, I especially like the integrated debugger and the ability to run the code during development.
I've used the trial version of Zend Studio, the cost kept me from further exploring this IDE much like PHP Storm.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> phpDesigner<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> This IDE is fairly fast, good debugger, able to run code from within the IDE, understands javascript and several different php frameworks.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Used NetBeans at the beginning, but I dislike it because it requires JRE and loads slow. Besides NetBeans, I used Komodo Edit, Dreamweaver, Notepad++, Aptana, Geany and phpDesigner. After NetBeans, I used Aptana. At that time (a few years ago), Aptana supported better HTML5 and CSS3. Though they were both slow (in my opinion). After realizing that their slow performance bothered me, I switched to text editors. It was at that point when I switched to Notepad++, and it's simplicity, performance, powerful features and customizability impressed me, and I sticked with it for a few years.  Until I met Sublime Text 2 - and instantly fell in love. It's functionality, speed and sleek look makes it the perfect tool for me. Not mention the Package Manager. I'll be honest - ever since I started using Sublime, I never looked at other IDEs or text editors anymore, so my opinion is probably outdated on the previously mentioned IDEs. I just don't feel the need to switch. Sublime has everything I need.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I use Sublime at work as well. My boss doesn't restricts us which IDE/text editor to use.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have been using Midnight Commander for 6 years. It was my first and the last editor for PHP and Linux-related scripts like bash and perl scripts. I was also using FTP/NFS/SSH connections build into MC. Coding with that was extremely fast. Copying files to my servers was even faster. Syntax highlighting was just only another good thing I had. 
But later my projects got bigger and bigger. Editing so many files in so many directories became harder. So I switched to Eclipse/Aptana because I was using that during my studies for Java programming. My performance went down, Eclipse is slow, it loads very slowly, build in FTP/SSH connections are even slower. So I switched to Netbeans and that was good decision till the moment I had to operate on code through samba connection. Netbeans couldn’t do that fast enough. So I finally switched to Sublime Text. My SSH/FTP connections are extremely fast and fully configurable (sending file automatically after saving to disc, downloading just specified folders, synchronizing files). Not to mention about possibilities I have in future with that tool I don’t know about now. Now I work for a quite big company, I have to jump between huge repositories of code. Inspecting big classes is easy and fast. That is what I need to my daily work.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> NetBeans<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> It was my previous IDE just before Sublime I am using right now. It is significantly faster than Aptana and easier to use. Integration with FTP/SSH servers is also better. The thing,  which is quite interesting using that IDE, is that autocomplete option for your code is designed in a very good way. It really helps you to code if you don’t know all the code you are depended on. I was using Netbeans for one year.<br>

But most of the features I didn't use and they made the IDE slow. Then I switched to Notepad++, since it was quite easy to use and was fast enough. As I remember the only shortcoming of it was the lack of unix support (few years ago I switched from win to ubuntu). About a year ago I started using Sublime Text 2. The two things I love the most about it: simplicity and extensibility. Dozens of plugins wait for you to facilitate your work. And it's unbelievable, but for free. Sublime Text 2 significantly speed my workflow up.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Compared to the other IDEs I tried (Neatbeans, Eclipse, Zend Studio), PHPStorm definitely earned my preference. It is continuously updated to integrate with the latest threats from the PHP world (i.e. composer, vagrant, etc) and its feature set and customization possibilities are remarkable. I can safely say that it doesn't miss anything I'd ever need from an IDE. Considering it's written in Java and it is definitely a heavy program (compared to, say, Sublime Text), It's reasonably fast too. I recommended it to every other developer I know, and no one has told me yet "I didn't like it, I switched to something else".<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Speed of work. Except for occassional hickups of the IDE, phpstorm is the fastest one I tried. Started with Windows Notepad, proceeded to PSPad due to syntax highlight (year 2002). Then changed to Eclipse (2003) and when Zend IDE Emerged, switched to that one. Was not satisfied with the speed and intellisense, so I switched later to NetBeans - a lots of plugins available made that easy. After discovering phpStorm (~2011), switched to that one and stayed, since Intellisense is really awesome. Would love to try VisualStudio though.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have used for long time notepad++ and its was great but its just a text editor, notepad++ was when i was on windows and when i got more serious and went from win to linux i used sublime but as i sad just text editors...
So i started using real IDEs like Dreamweaver "IDE", ZendStudio, Phpstorm, eclipse and finally NetBeans.
DW was a bit of everything but nothing, Zend to complex, phpstorm was awesome fast and stuff but the price pushed me away, it wasnt expensive but at that point i was not prepared to pay for any IDE, so i started using NB and fell in love with it, it had function which were great, good community, nice plugins...and all in all FREE :)<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Eclipse with PDT<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> It reminds me on NB xD
Eclipse or even phpstorm, reasons couse i have worked in them and they look most familiar to me.<br>

It has regular expressions search/replace, auto indent, soft word wrapping, syntax highlighting for many languages, folding of code based upon its indentation level (useful for collapsing deeply nested code, in order to more easily see the overall structure), keyboard macros, abbreviation expansion, shell interface, file browser, class browsers, etc.

Years ago, I tried several other programmers' editors, and found their support of regular expressions to be inferior to that of jEdit. I tried a few IDEs, but they were so complex and heavyweight that it took much longer to get started working on a project – especially just editing a single source file. JEdit may lack the project management normally offered by IDEs, but I find it gets the job done faster.<br>

Working with NetBeans feels so productive especially those intellisense, static code analysis, debugging (with XDebug) and project management. NetBeans has integrated source code manangement such as SVN, Git, and Mercurial which makes it a one stop development shop. I also use Notepad++ and Sublime Text Editor once in a while because those two are really really light compared to a full blown IDE but most of the time I use NetBeans. The main reason I use NetBeans is its intellisense and static code analysis. I don't do PHP that much as I do Java so the syntax and function names are really my bottle neck in developing PHP which is complemented by the IDE.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Before PHPStorm (6 months ago), I worked only in Sublime Text. I loved it (and still do), for it's speed, beauty, simplicity and the editor itself, which is very powerful and is a pleasure to use.

However, I had to switch to PHPStorm approximately 6 months ago. The reason is that because at work, we develop some highly complicated PHP and JavaScript applications, and a powerful IDE is practically a necessity. I think it improved my productivity by at least 25%. I wish it wasn't so ugly, slow and cluttered in UI though :(<br>

<b>Choice business real:</b> NetBeans<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> At the beginning of my career, they asked which IDE you want to have, so I told I need Netbeans.  They provided me the Dreamweaver also but I rarely use it. The other team mates were using Notpad++ which I couldn't understand why!? I discussed with them how you can debug your code, use github, manage your projects and such questions. They had no reasonable answer, and I started to give them a tour how Netbeans works. I knew that in a couple of month all of the developers should move to work on same project, so I asked them to think about it. 
Now, all of us use Netbeans and we're so happy to have our code format, Git versioning and all other stuff in a standard way.
I use Sublime sometimes for minor/temporary script modification, mainly to edit files from FTP/Filezilla.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I previously used Netbeans, but once I discovered PhpStorm and found it to be much more performant, I switched to that.

I also like PhpStorm's git and SVN integration, as well as its Symfony2 plugin.

I tend to use Geany as an alternative editor when I want to do quick edits to individual files that are not part of a project.

I've given Sublime a go, too, but it felt less of an IDE and more of a basic editor (I may not have had it configured properly?), but its default colour scheme and general performance is great. However, using it to edit individual non-project files isn't as straight forward as Geany.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I tried a lot of PHP IDEs over the years and mostly I used simple editors like TextPad, because every IDE was either to expensive to me (for personal use) or had/missed some things which made the work uncomfortable. I worked with Eclipse PDT and PHPEdit over some time, but they lacked some features. And both were very memory consuming (especially Eclipse) which brought me back to just using TextPad. 

Then a friend told me about phpStorm and I was totally blown away. It has so many cool features and even small things where the IDE just helps you with little bulbs and things. The list of usefull (!) features is very long, so it's hard to find the best. I think the most usefull for me are the many code inspections, the great Symfony2 support (via a seperate plugin), auto-completing (with "camel hump"), refactoring, Zero-Config debugging and also great Emmet (Zen Coding) support.

Oh, and I forgot to mention the "search everywhere" feature (double-tapping shift-key). It searches in menus, toolbars, filenames, classes, functions, IDE settings and much more...<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Speed! I run a Linux workstation, which limits IDE choice a bit. I've used Eclipse+PDT and NetBeans and for code sense PhpStorm blows them out of the water.

Xdebug support is good, VCS support is excellent. The IdeaVIM plugin is very good (I consider vi key bindings essential in an IDE).

Language injection isn't something I've seen in other IDEs and is really useful, most especially for me is good highlighting and easy execution of SQL from within a PHP file.

Composer integration is good. After that there seems to be numerous little features that make coding more pleasurable, but that one doesn't notice until using an IDE that doesn't provide them. Using PhpStorm is a pleasure.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Netbeans is my secondary IDE to SublimeText 2. I've tried Eclipse and Aptana, but chose Netbeans due to more intuitive and simpler UI.

I use Sublime for front-end or "less serious" projects, it's just so fast with all its great tricks (multicursor, fast-switch) and plugin ecosystem, but it does lack in proper programming support, it's a wonderful text editor, yet not exactly that much of IDE.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I used to work with Eclipse and Aptana (which is modified Eclipse for web development). But those two are rather slow and use a lot of memory. Usually it annoyed me when they got frozen unexpectedly. Maybe worth mentioning here is that I used Eclipse on Windows and Ubuntu. Aptana only on Ubuntu.

So, this is the main reason why I'm using PhpStorm: it rarely gets frozen. You can open there HTML, PHP, JS and recently even Mustache files and it colors the syntax for you, recently it has built-in command line tool which also is something I'm really fond of -- instead of having terminal window open and PhpStorm I have only PhpStorm. And it doesn't get frozen even when I'm using it as an editor and terminal at the same time :)

Except that PhpStorm helps me sync my files between my local storage and remote one. If I want to it's easy to sync it with GitHub.

It's also fast to jump between classes, functions, methods because PhpStorm scans your project's files.

We use PhpStorm to check our code if the code conventions are respected (.jshintrc, .jsbeautifyrc, .editorconfig files). And it has lots of plugins we can download and use.<br>

What sold me was code completion, refactoring, jumping back and forth between files, creating new files after I called for it in the source, reformatting according to my code style of choice, and many others. Two other factors were the excellent customer service and that they listen closely to the needs of their customers.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> ST3 is lightweight and powerful in a minimal interface.

It took me less than an hour to find, install, and learn to use the primary ST3 packages that allowed my workflow to become better than it had been with PHPStorm. Git is easy and automated with SublimeGit. Javascript and PHP debugging is easy with SublimeTextXDebug and Web Inspector for Sublime Text. And best of all, installing and using  ST packages is incredibly easy and maintains the lightweight usability of Sublime Text.<br>

I also use phpstorm or vim when I feel the need to something different. For the vim use, i think that it is obvious that this should be the command line editor, my choice. PhpStorm comes handy in some cases that i'm yet to figure it out in sublime, like seeing a function documentation in a popup or autocompleting twig templates.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Sublime Text<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Sublime is faster at reading files mounted on cifs, communication with the samba server, also helps.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Prior to building PHP applications I spent years building ColdFusion applications.

Since moving to work in PHP I've tried a number of IDE's and found most to be adequate, but nothing shines as strongly as PHPStorm. It's depth and ease of use is unmatched in my opinion.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Mostly it's around what you get used to, but I feel Netbeans has been making some significant efforts to support it's non-java user base for the last 2 or 3 years.
I find the project management, code completion and general user friendliness help to keep me productive. The integrated support for Composer, Git and code quality tools improve the professional quality of my work, while plugins are available to support Vagrant as well.
The excellent support for front end technologies allows me to work as a full stack developer without having to use 2 IDEs, which makes me more productive.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I started with Eclipse, but it ran too slowly. Netbeans was faster and had some great options but still wasn't ideal.

That and it works in OS X, Windows and Ubuntu. 

Even with the niggles in different hotkeys, it's still worth it.<br>

after getting my hands on  phpDesigner, there was no looking back, the program is so feature packed, that i never get to use all functions, but still, the ones i use, are easy to find, it's great that you can edit files directly from your different servers with FTP, and, GIT integration is also a great feature from one of the latest releases.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Hands down I have not found another PHP IDE better than PHP Storm. I started my PHP experience using Windows Notepad (please don't die, I know it is terrible). Afterwards, I started using Notepad++, which had syntax highlighting, cool! However, that was quickly replaced with Eclipse. I liked using Eclipse, but I found its auto complete, intellisense and documentation was not the best. I also would occasionally use VIM when when making quick edits on a server, but definitely would not be used in a large project of more than two or three files... I also have had some experience with Dream Weaver, but  found myself always wishing I was back in Eclipse because the auto complete was horrible. After thinking things could get no better, I started using Intellij by Jet Brains (instead of Eclipse) for my Java projects and was impressed at how much more efficient I was. The auto complete was to die for, the intellisense was instant and the debugger was amazing compared to Eclipse. So naturally I had to try PHP Storm as well. I already moved Eclipse to the trash bin, but PHP Storm caused me to nuke Eclipse off my machine forever.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have used Netbeans, Notepad++, Dreamweaver and Zend Studio.  I believe it's important to have an IDE that is fully featured, while not being resource intensive.  For these reasons, N++ is only a solid resource when I need to make quick, simple changes.  Although this is even difficult since the application lacks a larger set of features.  Netbeans doesn't fit the bill as it is a larger scale application with a more complicated environment.  Typically, I use Netbeans for Java based development.  Aptana seems to fit the bill as it has a smaller footprint and has the most appropriate interface.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Aptana<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I find it's simple and fast, but still has enough of what I need, especially with customization. I also like that's it's open-source and available on Linux, which is the main OS I use. I have tried various others including notepad++, Dreamweaver, NetBeans, Bluefish, TextWrangler and few others that are free or have trial periods. I liked some of the features more in Netbeans, but it just seemed a little too bloated and took a long time to load, especially compared to geany and even more so on older/lower-end devices. I'd love to try more.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Geany<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> As I am currently only working for and with myself I haven't been forced to use any other IDE/editors other than Dreamweaver in a class, which was painful. Of course, the main reason is that they didn't have any decent environments setup as far as a localhost server or node. All settings were wiped to default every night and they didn't have PHP5+(-S server). That being said I still don't care to ever use Dreamweaver even on a machine where I could set it up properly.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Sublime Text's flexibility and clean design is valued highly and allows for a comfortable, uncluttered design environment. Other IDEs tend to clutter the interface and, especially if java based, implement rather ugly designs that are not anti-aliased and make use of dated icons. Application specific code completion would be nice in Sublime Text, and offered, however the package's current implementation is not very robust.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I tried almost all popular IDE's and Editors I used phpdesigner most times when I was windows user. it was very nice indeed. then I moved to linux machine I tried Netbeans, Sublimetext, PHPStorm and several others. but the perfect choice was ZendStudio 10+. ZendStudio older versions was't good piece of software. but in v10+ it become awesome. ZS10 is fast now. it's cross-platform that is big advantage, it is based on Eclipse, very intelligent auto complete, debug friendly, phpunit fully supported, TDD is very easy, Git and SVN support without pain, ssh, terminal and sftp as well.. ZS 10 have much attention to Cloud. also it support Emmet, Refactoring etc.. like others. I did'nt like older versions. but ZS10+ is perfect choice. 
Now I'm ZS fan but simultaneously hope Netbenas being better because it is open-source project.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I used to use PhpED which is really fast and had very good code completion and excellent debugger but the lack of new features made me switch to PhpStorm which I was told is faster than NetBeans. The first thing I instantly fall in love with is the clean UI. On the other hand I hated that it tries to be so smart and warn me every possible problem that it actually has an insane amount of false positives so I had to turn most of the warnings off.

I use it for couple of years now and the features I love the most are all the amazing navigation actions (mostly go to class or go to method, but also things such as find usage) which I consider essential for any code base with more than 100 files. The main disadvantage of PhpStorm are probably all the tiny annoying bugs which are side effects of its very fast development.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> PHPStorm seems to me like the pinnacle of evolution when it comes to PHP IDEs. It is the first IDE that I considered good enough to buy a commercial license without giving it a second thought and without even looking back at the miriad of free alternatives in terms of IDEs.
It simply had everything I wanted and felt like miles ahead of any alternative in terms of features, performance, even looks.
It just feels like a very mature and stable product.
I have in the past used Notepad++, Sublime, Netbeans and a few online editors.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Netbeans - I used this for many years and think it is a brilliant IDE. Although it is often plagued with bugs and can be very slow at times. I also find the interface knowhere near as slick as PHPStorm.

Aptana - I used this a lot before Netbeans. It was faster than Netbeans but not as feature rich. They also dropped support for PHP, which was an odd choice (although they did put it back in again).

Dreamweaver - My first IDE. It&#39;s been many many many years since I last used it, so can&#39;t remember much about it, other than it used to make me MAD! That&#39;s when I looked for an alternative, which ended up being Aptana.

NuSphere PhpED - It&#39;s been a while since I used this one. I remember it being fast, but lacked features of the big ones (Netbeans &amp; PHPStorm). I remember liking it, but just missed features I needed.

Zend - I was disappointed with Zend. I found it slow and buggy. It also lacked the features I needed.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> PhpStorm is fast and multiplatform. It's also easy to maintain installation on multiplie platforms.
It handles multiple PHP framworks really well. Also there is pretty good VCS integration (GIT) and a very nice conflict resolution tool.
All functions are pretty well organised and they suite my workflow.
It's also very stable even with additional plugins.
Built in terminal, support for command line tools, easy deployment, database connectivity, change lists are really well organized into UI.
Also there are really nice themes 'out of the box'.
I've previously used Eclipse and ZendStudio and neither of them provided speed, functions, UI organization in basic installation and adding plugins often lead to unstable work.
NetBeans is a bit faster and more stable than Eclipse based IDEs but UI organization and look didn't suite me.
Sublime looks promising but I don't think it will suite me as I need a project oriented IDE.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> In the old days I used to use UltraEdit which was awesome at the time (yummy column mode!). I went over Eclipse (too slow) via NetBeans (we never really got friends - mainly because I was still madly in love with UE) to PhpStorm. 
I had discovered PhpStorm while I was following the excellent AngularJS tutorials at egghead.io. I never really looked back since - I had finally found the IDE that was exactly the IDE I wanted. 

What bothers me though is that it became sort of slow after the last update.

Oh, and did I mention SublimeText? This obviously is my favorite when it comes to light weight. And UltraEdit? I use it rarely theses days but there are still certain routines I wouldn't want to miss.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> PHPStorm has some of the best autocomplete and other basic features of any IDE I've used in the past.

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> For number of years I've been using NetBeans as my primary project editor. What I loved about NetBeans is jump-to-definition function built-in and of course auto-completion that automatically were taking used namespaces under consideration. But of course NetBeans have it's downside, which basically made me change it to a different one - it is written in Java, consumes lots of RAM and it's slow as a snail.
I've searched over the Internet, asked around my colleagues and my editor of choice is now SublimeText 3. At first it was a bit frustrating not having the features mentioned above, but after couple of minutes of configuration and some add-ons being downloaded Sublime became more and more friendly. The most important feature of Sublime for me is the speed of opening up the IDE itself plus of course the speed of opening large files (like 200 MB SQL query that I sometimes have to debug). Also the amount of plugins is a big plus for Sublime.<br>

<b>Choice personal:</b> PhpStorm<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Over the years, I have worked with several IDEs such as Eclipse (with PDT), PhpDesigner and PhpStorm. While PhpDesigner comes with a nice remote ftp out-of-the-box (for those days you run into clients where you actually *need* to work remotely), it by no far offers me the same quality of features such as code completion, formatting, version control and integration with other tools. Even though Eclipse also offers decent features (through plugins), I often ran into configuration and stability problems. With PhpStorm, things just *work*, and thus development in it has so far felt the most efficient and natural to me.<br>

The Darcula theme is good for my eyes.
All the options and fonctionality included seems to be made right for my need, and are easy to install (doc inline) : unit tests with phpunit, restfull calls tests, SVN implementation way with resume of changed files, comparison, refactoring tools with code duplication, format and advisory,etc. All is more good thinking and well merged.<br>

NotePad++ was one of the first code editors I used in my life. I think I first used it for HTML/CSS in high school. It is a very simplistic app, but it had syntax highlighting. It is lacking too many features I need and the ability to implement these features yourself.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I actually use multiple editors. Netbeans was the simply the IDE the other team members were using when I first joined. For Windows I don't think there is a better editor then Nusphere's PHPed. It has a great interface and also allows direct FTP/STFP editing which almost no editors provide out the box. I like Netbeans because of the cross platform likeness. I use Mac (main development machine), Windows (home pc) and Linux (both at work and home) daily so having an editor that is the same across all three is pretty important. That being said, I also do like Sublime (customised) and PHPStorm.<br>

Its syntax highlighting and editor is really good and notices you of any errors you make. It also incorporates various linting tools (JsHint, or PHP MD) that supports one to write better code.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I have used notepad++, several different smaller php related tools, vim on linux, eclipse, netbeans. Currently i have an (outdated :( ) personal license for phpstorm and would not like to switch to something else. it is by far the best tool i ever worked with, it (seems) to be as fast as a lightweight editor (e.g. notepad++) but delivers everything a developer would expect from an ide. How ever, for private purposes i only work with the ide if i need ide features. one script projects go equally fast / good in notepad++.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> In my current employment we went from PhpEd to Eclipse Pdt to Netbeans Php and settled now with PhpStorm. The most important argument for Phpstorm was the ability to create a hassle free deployment to our development servers (currently with SMB / Phpstorm -&gt; auto deploy to directory). Additionally we benefit from the integration of our project/managment tool with phpstorm (redmine). 

Eclipse was slow in comparison and could some of the things phpstorm includes only with hacks (try to deploy to a ssh target!)

Netbeans was faster (still not as fast as phpstorm) and is a good IDE.  Still some of our challenges could only be solved by using hacks - we still didn&#39;t have a decent deployment - workflow still was not smooth.

well, then came phpstorm. :)<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I've tried Netbeans, Eclipse, and some other Java based IDEs, but all had an issue with the amount of system resources required and lengthy response times.
I have also tried various text editors, like Textpad, Kate and Vim but they all lack some of the features that make every day coding that bit easier.
Sublime was good, but seems to be missing a few key IDE features.
I selected KDevelop as Kate had been my preferred text editor, so all the shortcuts I had learnt and syntax highlighting I had built continued in KDevelop.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> Under Linux (my development environment of choice), it's the fastest I've seen among many free and paid alternatives. I was first attracted by the possibility to skin the entire UI and not just the editor windows. As time passed and I kept using it I discovered a myriad of other features that I now cannot work. I like the intelligent code hinting/suggestions, the blazing fast indexing and parsing, the fact that it supports not only PHP but also JavaScript, HTML and SQL databases - combined with SSH, Vagrant, Composer, GIT, SVN, SQL query console, visual diff tools - it is literally the one tool that gives you everything you need to do your job in one place. PHP Storm just looks and feels modern and cutting-edge, kudos to the team for that.<br>

<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I've tried many editors when I wasn't using Symfony. I give a try to many IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans, Aptana but no one was first and offer a easy way to work with remote files. I switched to SublimText a year ago when developing simple web app.

Now, I use Symfony so I needed an ide with would provide a really great completion, with git integrated and that the main reason I start to used PhpStorm. IMO, PhpStorm is to PHP what IntelliJ (from the same company) was for Java: a clean, great and fast IDE.<br>
<b>Choice business real:</b> Zend Studio<br>
<b>Explain why in as much detail as you wish:</b> I used this IDE (in a old version) at work because this is the only one which provides a way to develop with remote files by FTP only (our sources are on a internal server and we don't use a VCS)<br>
