<b>Quote:</b> As someone who's not a resident of the San Francisco, I don't have a strong opinion, but just knowing about the discussion, seeing mom and pop businesses pushed out... I know that more business around would bring tourism, but it would risk getting part of the local culture removed.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> As someone who&#39;s lived in the Bay Area for a long time, seeing all the changes and developments, some is for better, but it definitely pushes part of the community out. Needles &amp; Pens and other retailers are the ones pushed out. Adobe closing was a sign. It really says something that Jack Spade would move in.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> Jack Spade would be yet another force in gentrifying the neighborhood, which ultimately means displacing primarily low-income communities of color, many who have been in the community for generations. The replacement will be a homogenous, vapid space that only caters to those with money - it will help to create an environment that is void of character and just another corridor for high end commerce. Jack Spade belongs in a shopping mall downtown, not in the Mission.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> Honestly, I am personally in support of Jack Spade opening across the street from our 16th Street boutique. I know that is going to piss a lot of people off, but 16th Street is a lot different then the rest of the Valencia corridor. We have two transient hotels, ten or so bars and multiple liquor stores...It's really hard though. With the streets current condition I think that Jack Spade will definitely be a benefit to the area. I hope that their presence on the street will help clean things up...Jack spade is definitely not trying to move into the nicest part of the neighborhood. Just last month there was a fatal shooting a few doors down from where they want to open.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> They already signed the lease, they're already on their way in. On the one hand, they [expletive] us by paying so much more for rent. On the other hand, more people will come to the neighborhood in the day time. The city screwed up with zoning because they allowed 100 restaurants to open on Valencia within two years. It only brings people in the nighttime, so my businesses suffer during the day.... We need to balance shoppers between day and night.<br>

<b>Person Talked To:</b> Paul Stoll, owner<br>
<b>Quote:</b> I have been bombarded with opposition on the opening of Jack Spade and I understand how a fancy store like that may change the overall feel and customer base of the district. However, I have yet to see how this will actually hurt me and my business. 'It will drive up rent!' Not my rent, I will be fine. 'It's a chain store and that ruins the Mission!' Giordano Bros is a chain restaurant already here without opposition, and the area is well past gentrified with all the fancy restaurants etc.... On the other hand, Body Manipulations will do well... We sell high end body jewelry to an array of clients. It helps to explain the value of solid gold body jewelry having the same value as traditional gold jewelry to folks who spend $300 on the shirt they are wearing. Still, we are in no means suffering in the Mission without new money. We are a destination location. Still, a bit more foot traffic couldn't hurt.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> For me, it's a little bit much ado about nothing. I don't have a strong opinion. I'm surprised, I'd like not to see Valencia as gentrified as Chestnut, but that will take awhile... Nobody wants to get a needle in their foot when buying a $400 handbag.<br>

<b>Quote:</b> I think it will bring more of a crowd, more people up from Valencia. It will be good for business. There's not that many good clothing stores, mostly secondhand. It won't affect used clothing stores...Bad thing would be that rents are high, not good for neighborhood... I'm totally against big stores...There's always two points to every argument.<br>
