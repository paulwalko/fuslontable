<b>Details:</b> In the matter of Michael McDarby and Sean Acton, solicitors practising under the style of Michael McDarby &amp; Company, Solicitors, Glebe Street, Ballinrobe, Co Mayo, and in the matter of an application by a named client of the respondent solicitors to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and in the matter of the Solicitors Acts 1954-2002 [4200-7533/DT31/07] A named client of the respondent solicitors (applicant) Michael McDarby (first-named respondent solicitor) Sean Acton (second-named respondent solicitor) On 18 September 2008, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found the respondent solicitors guilty of misconduct in their practice as solicitors in respect of the following complaints set out in the affidavit of the applicant sworn on 22 February 2007: a) The applicant subsequently engaged Sean Acton, of Michael McDarby &amp; Co to pursue her civil action arising out the damage to her vehicle and injuries sustained in the accident The applicant was not aware, nor did Sean Acton make her aware, that his partner, Michael McDarby, in the firm of solicitors Michael McDarby &amp; Co was or had already acted for one of the other parties involved in the accident The applicant believes he should have told her, and she believes that he should have been aware of that fact, as there is a duty and responsibility on him to know those things He had advised her to plead in the District Court to careless driving and had represented her in that court and obtained a full booklet of statements from the gardaåÕ at that time, and the applicant cannot believe or see how either he or his partner Michael McDarby could not be aware of that fact b) The applicant believes that the first thing Michael McDarby would have done in representing the other party is to obtain the booklet of statements from the gardaåÕ, and there wouldn&#39;t be much point in obtaining statements from the gardaåÕ if her solicitor, Sean Acton, in the same office, had already obtained them Furthermore, the applicant believes that it would be necessary for Michael McDarby to ascertain what transpired in the District Court and how the prosecution against her had concluded The applicant finds it difficult to believe that, in making those enquiries, he would not have ascertained that his partner, Sean Acton, had acted for her in the District Court and hence he would have been aware that there was a clear conflict of interest in members of his solicitors&#39; firm acting for two sides of proceedings arising out of the same traffic accident, where it was obvious that a conflict of interest not alone had, but would, arise c) Not alone did Sean Acton act for the applicant in the criminal case, but he was also pursuing a civil action at the same time as his partner Michael McDarby was pursuing a civil action for another party involved in the same action The tribunal ordered that the respondent solicitors: a) Stand admonished and advised, b) Pay a sum of €500 to the compensation fund, c) Pay 25% of the costs of the applicant as taxed by a taxing master of the High Court in default of agreement
