The city is eerily quiet...no sirens, no fire engines or helicopters....not even traffic or music from other residents.  Nothing...not a peep.</a><br>

I wasn't surprised to hear about outrage following the death of Freddie Gray, just as I wasn't surprised when I heard it turned to more violent acts such as rioting. What did surprise me was when my friend from Las Vegas texted me asking me what was going on, the news in the rest of the country was reporting on the riots but didn't say why they had began or what the original protests were regarding. I'm sad that so many people focused only on the negatives or that they couldn't even humor the idea that the people of Baltimore, specifically West Baltimore, have just had enough. </a><br>

I'm a retired MTA Police Officer. I believe I've seen this story from both sides.

As a resident of Lafayette projects I have experienced the frustration of complaints going unheard, of mistreatment the hands of the police,ugh not having a father figure in the house and watching my mother try to eek out a living with limited assistance.

I've tried to make sense of what I seen over these past couple of days and Baltimore City. Personal experience, my reasoning of the events may be biased.

I believe the overt actions of those protesters wreaked havoc representative of the overwhelming fear and frustration that has been building for many generations. has been instilled in us grandparents our parents. as soon as we can walk, they tell us, open quotation don't run! Don't act out! Don't make noise! Sit quietly!they tell us this and hope that we won't be looked down upon by the fairer race. initially, we don't know why we receive these instructions, but eventually when we place time and circumstance with the utterance of these instructions it becomes clearthe reason for this extreme order. After years of being taught to fear and ears of not being heard when we complaincoupled with the fairly recent treatment of those suspected of criminal activity, and in some cases those that appear to have committed no crime and old or severely injured beaten or killed, the fear returns.

The destruction of property and the assaults on police, though inexcusable, are a result of the fear. these actions say, today I will not fear you, to prove to you that I do not fear you I will attack you. I will commit atrocities that you threaten to arrest me beat me kill me for in your presence to show you that I do not fear you.

This is just my personal take on it. I don't condone violence destruction but if asked to attempt to understand what has occurred, this would represent my understanding past events.</a><br>

It was a fascinating scene and I felt that this was a positive thing for Baltimore.  As more violent incidents occurred that eventing, I was unsure and skeptical of what was being broadcast.  The images from the cameras were not as dire as the words coming from the local anchors and reporters mouths.  Nothing was clear and I was not willing to accept that the same people that marched peacefully were the same protestors or outside agitators that were being shown.  On Monday, as the reports of an actual riot occurring started coming in, I was filled with sadness, anger, fear, and compassion.  What we have seen can't be simplified into one word or emotion.  It is far too complex to be boiled down to a headline or sound byte.  I know that I will be pondering what I saw and felt for weeks and months to come.  I will wrestle with how I feel about what I saw, how I feel about those involved, and, most importantly, what I can do to make sure this never happens again.  We should welcome those who want to ask the proper questions of police, organizers, government and residents.  We need to fight back against anyone who tries to simplify this or use it for their personal or corporate gain.  I hope that all who love Baltimore will not let fear change their feelings for the city and that they will return to dine, shop, and play there.  We can't abandon the city as was done in the past.  We need it and it needs us.</a><br>

I watched what unfolded Monday afternoon from my office on a helicopter feed.  I am familiar with Mondawmin and played softball on the fields just North of it.  It tore me apart to see something so familiar break at the seams.  Baltimore has significant issues from which these horrible events emerge.  There are deep rooted issues within the police department and in the communities that need addressing.  The outpouring of support and kindness the morning after is the part of Baltimore that means so much to me and a part that shines brighter in the days, weeks, and years to come.  News tends to focus on the tearing apart as opposed to the stitching together.  Baltimore can become stronger and fairer and I hope that is the story that emerges.</a><br>

My husband, Wayne (then a reporter for The Atlanta Journal), and I were newly married when Dr. King was assassinated. As Atlanta handled this horrific event with dignity and care, parts of Baltimore burned. Although I saw the news reports on TV, my mother was our primary source for the riots and their aftermath. Each week, she dutifully snail-mailed the articles clipped daily from The Morning Sun and The Evening Sun. This was a pre-Internet time without the influence of social media. I could not interact flexibly then as I have done in recent days through tweets, emails, and Facebook posts about the current surreal situation in the city I still love. As in decades past, I am hoping Baltimore will rise from the ashes and chaos and will have yet another new beginning. Perhaps this time the city will get it right.</a><br>

There are subtle differences that are already apparent - corruption seems more transparent here, racism is differently clouded by class and education, the relationship of the county to the city is so unambiguously one of loathing and fear. But the fury and the misery seem much the same. My response to the unrest has been grief tempered by dissociation. This isn't quite my home yet. I'm not sure how to help people I don't know. Maybe that's the underlying problem - we're paralyzed by the distances we've allowed to persist. I was horrified to learn that some friends were cooking for the "first responders" - in what bizarre universe do white progressives respond to police brutality against POC by making snacks for the cops?</a><br>

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I am a teacher in the city and teach right off North Ave. At 12:15 the staff and students received notice that all after-school activities would be canceled and students were expected to leave immediately after school, with no explanation as to why. Through the afternoon many parents came to pick their students up and students began sharing information about a "purge." Students said that people were planning to loot at the mall and some even thought that they were going to attack our school. There was a lot of confusion and students were nervous. Teachers were asked to go home as well, as we were closing the building. That night I, like many, watched in horror as parts of the city descended into chaos, but the following day, with schools closed, fellow teachers and I headed out to North Ave. to help clean up, and we also worked to open a community space for students. Many businesses donated food, and people came and brought water, art supplies, and offered their time as we tried to create a safe space for students and their families in the community. When students returned on Wednesday we shared our reactions, and many students said they felt angry and powerless about what happened. Some of my students know people who participated in looting or violence towards law enforcement, but none of my students condoned it. We also had some students who were personally affected and unable to come to school or who did not feel it was safe to leave home. For those who were there, we discussed reasons for the unrest, and I heard from students that people in our city need help and opportunity, and that was the cause.</a><br>

When I woke and checked Twitter, I read about the gathering of students. 
  After making my lunch, I got to my car and turned on the news, which was covering the incident at Mondawmin. I chose a route which took me away from that direction but others had the same idea. It was chaos getting to work as I followed the deteriorating situation on the radio. By the time I got to work, the police gathered their injured and were leaving.
   The Mayor and Commissioner have been playing from behind since Gray's was injured. I am seriously done with this city.</a><br>

It makes people feel powerless over their own lives and it  needs to change, but change can only occur once those in power are held accountable and those in power can only be held accountable after they know what truly happened. Freddie Gray's death is a tragedy, but unlike Michael Brown and a whole host of other young black men killed at the hands of police, the true circumstances that surrounded his death remain unknown. As a result, I have all the sympathy in the world for the protestors.  They seemed to actually be having an impact and I am sure they will not rest until there is justice for Freddie and significant police reform.  I also have sympathy for the rioters in 1968 and the rioters in Ferguson, even if I don't completely understand their rationale. I have no sympathy whatsoever for children who preemptively plan to destroy property in the name of justice because they think they can get away with it, who make the reputation of our city even worse, and who detract from the good work others have done.</a><br>

My life partner is a native of Baltimore and through his exposure, I have come to TRULY love Baltimore city!  My heart breaks to see the sadness in his eyes when we watch the news reports.  My soul aches when I think about the reasons why this has happened.

As a culture and a supposedly 'civilized' society, haven't we learned ANYTHING YET?  Why does all of this madness continue?  And by madness, I mean ALL of it - the police brutality towards all people, the economic disparity of the rich and the poor, our political leaders who govern with their own 'agendas; my list could go on and on, however I think you get my message.

The violence and hatred must stop or NOTHING will be accomplished.  We here on the west coast have also had our issues with accountability from the police.  Nothing will change until the people demand a change!  Keep demanding and don't let this fade off the radar!  However, BE PEACEFUL BALTIMORE and try not to give anyone a reason to tarnish your message!  BE STRONG BALTIMORE and keep your demonstrations peaceful!  BE HOPEFUL BALTIMORE and show the rest of the world HOW IT CAN BE DONE!  This is one of those 'defining moments' in history and you want to 'define' it correctly!

The rest of the US, and the world, are praying for you! BE STRONG BALTIMORE, BE STRONG!</a><br>

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I encountered a group of 500 or so people marching in the street while walking my dog, at around 7:30pm.  The group I witnessed was diverse and peaceful.  Some people were chanting, others carrying signs and flags, and others taking pictures.  Had I not had my easily excitable dog with me, I would have jumped right in!  Its refreshing to see the issue of police brutality getting the attention it deserves, and even more sweet to see so many people dedicated to getting that message through DESPITE all of the violence and destruction caused by a small minority of Baltimore residents.  Despite the scary stories I've heard from other parts of town, this group seemed like 500 of my friends.  There was a light police presence, mostly escorting in the front and rear.  I'm sure plenty of backup was staged nearby, as there were multiple helicopters overhead and tons of law enforcement presence throughout the city.  Although, after seeing the video of the WeAreChange journalists being shot with less lethal munitions, the increased presence doesn't make me any more comfortable...</a><br>

I have lived in Baltimore City for 15 years and was very shaken by the days events. I had just driven up to Towson from downtown and the roads were empty. I was upset and hesitant to discuss this with my students but it was all they wanted to talk about. We had a discussion about the events that lead to the violence and the underlying issues. I showed them how we as journalists were covering the issues. It made me feel slightly better to be in the company of 18 thoughtful and concerned young people. After class I went home and watched the news and worked late into the night. </a><br>

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I am a teacher in the city and teach right off North Ave. At 12:15 the staff and students received notice that all after-school activities would be canceled and students were expected to leave immediately after school, with no explanation as to why. Through the afternoon many parents came to pick their students up and students began sharing information about a "purge." Students said that people were planning to loot at the mall and some even thought that they were going to attack our school. There was a lot of confusion and students were nervous. Teachers were asked to go home as well, as we were closing the building. That night I, like many, watched in horror as parts of the city descended into chaos, but the following day, with schools closed, fellow teachers and I headed out to North Ave. to help clean up, and we also worked to open a community space for students. Many businesses donated food, and people came and brought water, art supplies, and offered their time as we tried to create a safe space for students and their families in the community. When students returned on Wednesday we shared our reactions, and many students said they felt angry and powerless about what happened. Some of my students know people who participated in looting or violence towards law enforcement, but none of my students condoned it. We also had some students who were personally affected and unable to come to school or who did not feel it was safe to leave home. For those who were there, we discussed reasons for the unrest, and I heard from students that people in our city need help and opportunity, and that was the cause.</a><br>

There is a love/hate relationship I have with spring and early summer in Baltimore, the weather has finally broken and the nights are beautiful which brings everyone outside. With a park across the street, neighbors enjoy themselves from the early afternoon into the late evening. It’s typical for me to be woken up around 11 pm or midnight (sometimes later) with the sounds of folks laughing or occasionally arguing, sounds that while I have grown accustomed to, will still jolt me wide awake in the middle of a deep sleep.  These past two days, I’ve missed those sounds and the interrupted sleep that comes with it. I love my city and the people that reside here. I am eager for change and pray that love guides all of us as we seek to heal and move the city forward.</a><br>

I've been following mostly on Twitter, which seems to me closer to the people and events. I am proud of the communities of Baltimore, of the students and professors here at UMBC who are participating in the city. I am moved by the number of people, of cities showing solidarity for #baltimoreuprising. I have hope--though the historian in me is cynical--that all of the protests from Ferguson onward will lead to better oversight of the force, better training and community involvement, and a broader awareness of racial bias in our police and prison systems. I worry that this uprising will be used as an excuse not to invest in those neighborhoods that need it most.</a><br>

All sides sit in justification of the reasoning behind what they did and none took a step back to be HUMAN or have HUMANITY.  While you sit there and pat your back you  have lost hope to many which you say you tried to gain. Young eyes looking up to you all for some peace and resolve only found violence. Shame on Baltimore Rioters- Shame on the Individual Police involved in Freddie Grays death. </a><br>

We've been forgotten. Our schools systems have failed us. There's no job opportunities , rec center closing , police abusing power and the over decay that 20+ year has ever seen of this area. You can't help but understand the frustrations of this. I didn't riot or loot in fact I was one of the ones cleaning up before going off to work.While I can say I don't think that the situation was handled well from public officials , and I do believe that this could've been handled alot better. Especially why would you cut off the public transportation for these kids after school let so they could go home? And if they didn't want to go home as officers of "peace and order" they should keep the buses and subway running to get the kids out of the area. That's doesn't excuse the what happened either way but it is a factor in the matter.  hope with this attention we can get some growth in the area and hopefully repair our schools and police.  </a><br>

Racism is still an issue in Baltimore City and  police brutality is an issue as well. This is sadly history repeating itself.

Little did we know that the opportunists in the Northeast section of the city bear us would begin looting local family owned businesses. Those instances weren't captured in the media.

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I believe the riots were divine intervention. Who in their right mind let's teenagers out of school, with no way home, in the middle of the day, with no adult supervision, and then aggravates them during a very emotional time for the whole city. It was stupid and incendiary to the whole situation. Furthermore, this is not the 60's generation or any other generation. These kids are a whole new breed. So of course that situation blew up in the face of local officials. Yet I believe it was divine intervention because it clearly showed the Willie Lunch syndrome has ended and I am so encouraged. The idea of pitting us against one another: the young against the old, the 'thugs' against the working poor, educated Blacks against the poorly educated. The main stream media tried every trick in the book and we stood firm. The Councilman who refused to call our children 'thugs' and said, "say what you mean". The Crips and Bloods that spoke like true 'G's' and said the main stream media was lieing and refused to be blamed. The community workers who told how the riot really started. The older people who started coming out to support the protest after seeing how it was being portrayed. The college students who supported the inner city by speaking of the real issues and not being swayed. The riots and the medias portrayal cause Chicago, New York and D.C. to protest in support. Now racist America can be scared because they should be. When you see real solidarity of Blacks from all walks of life, when you see Crips and Bloods and the Nation of Islam in one picture, when you see the older generation come out in support, when you see educated Blacks not disavowing their impoverished brothers and sista's, when you see people across the nation come out and show support so those in the spotlight know they are not alone, that's when you should be scared. Yet, the best part is that the police and the media did exactly what they always do so routinely, so blatantly, so transparently it worked counter to their goal. I am one of those who don't want us as Blacks to lose this moment. I want us to capitalize on it. The officers responsible will most likely get off because our justice system hasn't changed only we have. But the riots got us to network and meet new people. They showed us that we are united. They brought back that ol' attitude of perseverance through adversary. So after all the deaths we are finally ready to stand together and demand whatever we want from America.

Upon leaving the city, driving down Pratt Street toward Gay Street, I noticed (mostly unmanned) police SUVs parked on the sidewalk of almost every corner from Howard to Gay. There was an increased police presence, but it was very quiet and calm. When I turned down Gay Street, peaceful protesting had slowly started at City Hall, and there was a frenzy of media photographers, reporters and cameras calmly waiting for something to happen, for something to start. The media were already reporting before anything ever happened. I find it fascinating that so many reporters, anchors, photographers, put their personal safety at risk to cover the events between April 23 and today. And not one single related event went uncovered because of it. Everything was caught on camera, in print or online. It's the new age of storytelling - and I think almost everyone was heard by someone in some way. The volume of coverage called into question the quality, fairness and content, but journalists covering the riots became part of the story, and I'm proud of them for risking it all so the rest of us never missed a beat.</a><br>

Confusion, anger, and sorrow. As a white man, I cannot ever really understand the specific pain my black neighbors are enduring, but I do sympathise immensely. The curfew we had was a very strange experience for me, someone who lives on the city line. Always being aware of where I am, and making sure I don't turn down the wrong street for a week. I am glad that the State's Attorney acted so swiftly in pressing charges on the 6 officers involved in this heinous act of overreaching power by the city police. I hope justice comes for Freddie, and I hope we can reform the police department radically so that we never have to face these challenges again. </a><br>

While the slogan “The Greatest City in America” may be a stretch, “Charm City” is not.  Baltimore has always been a part of my life but it has been my home for over a decade.  In that time I have felt its charm creep in.  It gets under your skin.  You think, “I’ll live here for a few years and get my feet wet and move on”.  And then a few more years go by and you haven’t and you can’t answer why.  And then a few more years pass and you just don’t want to leave.  It is far from perfect but it is certainly better than the events that have taken place over the last three weeks.  

There is a dichotomy to this city, just as there is in its’ police department, just as there is in the protesters that have taken to the streets. Clearly the police have to answer for the events that led up to the death of Freddie Gray.  Just as the protesters have to answer for the riots and destruction on Monday. But not every police officer is a bad person.  Just as not ever protester is a bad person.  Not every police officer uses excessive force just as not every protester was burning and looting Monday night.  As a resident of Baltimore I get a chance to get a more nuanced picture.  Not the one you see on CNN or FoxNews.  For every corrupt officer there are a hundred who are incorruptible and who protect this city.  For every looter and rioter there are a hundred protesters who speak out peacefully and with respect.  Just as the police officers involved in this case are entitled by right to their due process so are the people of Baltimore entitled by right to speak freely and peacefully in angst.  So while Baltimore is not necessarily “The Greatest City in America” it is these unalienable rights and  dichotomies that make Baltimore a great American city.  I’m still proud to call it my home and I’m not going to let the actions of the misguided few turn me against the many good people of Baltimore. 

In the words of Laura Lippman, “Anyone can love a perfect place.  Loving Baltimore takes some resilience.”

I've been tracking the news by minute with live coverage and I went down to Penn and North to look at Monday's aftermath. All I have to say is stop coming up with excuses. There is literally no excuse for destroying this city. Freddie Gray was caught selling drugs more times than I can count on both of my hands. He was a key contributor to the constant destruction of the community before the riots. Now, communities are completely destroyed as a form of "protest". This is all complete ignorance. It is all evil, there is no excuse. These ignorant looters thought it would be an easy way to get free designer clothing and Air Jordans, nothing else. They're much more than criminals. Don't sell drugs in Baltimore and you wont get beaten to death by Police. The police chief is black, the mayor is black, the President of the United States is black. Half of the BPD is black, and I bet if you made the entire force black the same problem would still exist because of the daily frustration they face by seeing these "innocent" kids selling drugs and destroying their community day after day. </a><br>

Many are missing the larger issue at hand; Freddie Gray's death is symptomatic of a pervasive racial injustice problem across our country. While property damage is not okay, neither is the brutality that led to Gray's passing and the deaths of countless other young black men. When people have been systematically subjugated and their peaceful pleas for justice and equality go unheard, can we really expect them to remain peaceful? How else will they convince people to listen, that black lives matter? While I hope for peace, I also hope for equality and justice, and Baltimore is far from all three.</a><br>

While the event may have ended in violence at camden yards, the large majority of participants were peaceful and standing in solidarity. We were surrounded by families, students, people of all walks of life who all had one goal: promoting justice.  I went all the way to camden yards and stood as a part of a peaceful group of concerned citizens that wanted to voice their distress. Baltimore is not all riots and fire like some would like to believe. </a><br>

We just moved here less than 2 weeks ago, and not to minimize recent events, but after having lived in Chicago for the past 12, you kind of become numb to violence &amp; crime. You accept it as part of life in the city. But now I&#39;m a mother and things got too real and too close for me. I was walking our daughter home from daycare, pushing the stroller down Charles toward Centre, when suddenly there was a stream of people running east on Centre, throwing bricks and rocks into the windows of the 7-Eleven on the corner. It took a minute to realize what I was witnessing then I thought, &quot;I need to get out of here. I need to get somewhere safe.&quot; I didn&#39;t know what to do or where to go so I raced back to daycare which is located in the basement of a church. The word sanctuary immediately came it mind. We waited there until my husband could come get us and take us home. It was scary, I was scared, but not for myself, for my 5 mo old daughter, for her well being &amp; safety. Like I said, a year ago, I probably would have been one of the bystanders taking photos and video of the looting, but it&#39;s bigger than me now. </a><br>

I was constantly watching WBAL, WJZ and CNN since the 2015 riots began and I feel these riots are a result of long-time ignorance by city, state and federal government of the long-standing issues Baltimore City has faced ever since the Riots of 1968 which Baltimore City still, in 2015, has not fully recovered from. I am not in any way trying to justify nor condone the violence that has taken place, however people of color here in Baltimore CIty have issues that are clearly being ignored. Racism is still an issue in Baltimore City, police brutality is clearly an issue in Baltimore City.

My parents lived in Baltimore during the 1968 riots which was a result of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination and said they saw multiple areas of the city burning, the National Guard come in and Baltimore placed under martial law. In a sense, this is sadly history repeating itself, I am very hopeful that Baltimore does NOT go under martial law with these riots and things get back to normal, the National Guard leaves, hopefully the street gang members who decided to unite to urge for peace and calmness will remain united and try to keep peace and calm. I am extremely hopeful that businesses will not leave Baltimore City as a result of this extremely unfortunate part of history of Baltimore City and businesses will work with Baltimore City to help rebuild and clean up.</a><br>

THIS JUST HAS TO STOP !!!!!!!  Anger can come out in many different way&#39;s and some people react differently then other&#39;s, I&#39;m NOT saying that it&#39;s o.k. to destroy others property but without the proper guidance things will go VERY WRONG and it really doesn&#39;t help much that we are not allowed to correct our children without the authorities coming after the parents that care enough about our children to step in, it&#39;s almost like we are handing our children over to them so they can do it for us, and from where I&#39;m sitting that looks GRIM.  EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR UPSET, I&#39;M UPSET TOO,  BUT JUST STOP THE CRAZINESS SO THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUS, WILL BE THE FOCUS &amp; THAT&#39;S FREDDY GRAY.

This April, I earned my Doctorate after 8 years studying water quality in Baltimore streams. I love this city. It has taught me so much.  Baltimore is filled with beauty, art, and intellectualism.  It also has a lot of ugliness and a long history of injustice. I am proud of all the peaceful protesters who stood up for black lives. I am also grateful to the many Police officers who do the right thing. I hope our current state of turmoil will shed a light on the challenges faced and help us to build a brighter future for all. Black lives matter. Period.  Blue lives matter.  Period. We can and will be better. </a><br>

The streets were full of people gathering to communicate, there were several prayer circles to be seen. Suddenly, a drum procession began, which included dancers of all ages. The &quot;performers&quot; (who were of course community members using their musical talents to bring everyone together), chanted &quot;We don&#39;t want no problems, we come in peace&quot; and &quot;Follow me, follow me to a place we can be free.&quot; The evening was more of a celebration than anything. Before leaving, a young boy came up to me and said &quot;This is the real Baltimore, not the riots people are talking about. This right here.&quot; He hugged me, said he appreciated me, and we went our separate ways, though both toward a new and better Baltimore. </a><br>

I'm a retired MTA Police Officer. I believe I've seen this story from both sides.

As a resident of Lafayette projects I have experienced the frustration of complaints going unheard, of mistreatment the hands of the police,ugh not having a father figure in the house and watching my mother try to eek out a living with limited assistance.

I've tried to make sense of what I seen over these past couple of days and Baltimore City. Personal experience, my reasoning of the events may be biased.

I believe the overt actions of those protesters wreaked havoc representative of the overwhelming fear and frustration that has been building for many generations. has been instilled in us grandparents our parents. as soon as we can walk, they tell us, open quotation don't run! Don't act out! Don't make noise! Sit quietly!they tell us this and hope that we won't be looked down upon by the fairer race. initially, we don't know why we receive these instructions, but eventually when we place time and circumstance with the utterance of these instructions it becomes clearthe reason for this extreme order. After years of being taught to fear and ears of not being heard when we complaincoupled with the fairly recent treatment of those suspected of criminal activity, and in some cases those that appear to have committed no crime and old or severely injured beaten or killed, the fear returns.

The destruction of property and the assaults on police, though inexcusable, are a result of the fear. these actions say, today I will not fear you, to prove to you that I do not fear you I will attack you. I will commit atrocities that you threaten to arrest me beat me kill me for in your presence to show you that I do not fear you.

This is just my personal take on it. I don't condone violence destruction but if asked to attempt to understand what has occurred, this would represent my understanding past events.</a><br>

While I am beginning to believe there is a valid issue that needs to be addressed regarding racial bias with law enforcement, that is no excuse for the criminal behavior that I would go as far as characterizing as domestic terrorism. Unfortunately, the behavior has distracted the leaders and media to issues that are not what was intended by prior lawful protests and it has also perpetuated disproportionate stereotypes of city residents. In the end, no matter the circumstance, personal accountability cannot be forgotten. I truly hope these events can lead to a better Baltimore; its a shame that so much distruction to challenged areas has been the outcome thus far. </a><br>

My biggest concern is that if this only happened as a result of the rioting, much still needs to be done. EVERY person who looted, rioted, burned down buildings, and assaulted police officers need to be brought to justice as well! In order for the BPD to be effective they need to make it clear that two wrongs don't make a right and, no matter how long it takes, every person who committed crimes that were captured on videotape need to be brought in, charged, and even if they receive no jail time, be held accountable by way of paying a fine and/or completing some type of community service that BENEFITS the community! A family has lost a son and 15 officers were injured, small business owner were victimized as well. each and EVERY VICTIM deserves JUSTICE!!</a><br>

Freddy Gray was injured before they put him in that van.. I pray they all rot in help for what they did.</a><br>

The protests and riots definitely pushed toward what could bea victory of equality amongst human beings. ...Black,  white,  rich,  poor, badge or no badge.  What many saw as chaos, destruction and madness,  I saw as a fight and decades of numerous different things with our neighborhoods surrounding the downtown area and all other upscake areas and tourist attractions being neglected and left on the backburner. Also some junk that we do have in our police department as far as some crooked police officers and brutality. We needed to be heard with our cry out for change, equality and fair justice. I am not by any means justifying the way some things were expressed. However unfortunately for things to get better and for changes to come,  things must get ugly first.   Look at history. It clearly shows. War for America to gain independence as it's own free Nation. Abraham Lincoln killed for setting slaves free. JFK. .Dr. Martin Luthor King Jr. Both killed for standing for something different and bringing change. I believe the events that have occurred in this past week (good and bad) have opened up a door to what could be a better Baltimore. If you have an open mind, there' is beauty in it all.  Rest in peace Freddie Gray. Fly high!  Though you're gone physically,  your spirit rests now and moved powerfully through this city.  I would also like to thank our protesters,  the rioters, our police department, our mayor,  our commissioner,  the national guard for everything. </a><br>

How did the States Attorney for Baltimore react in less than a day.  Everyone says she should take a little time to evaluate the report.  It is a rush to judgment.  It is now basically a black city and lets hope it will be better in the future.  It appears from the leaders what they want for the city is far beyond the police problem.  They want jobs, better education, better pay, more recreational areas, better shopping areas, etc. and all with 5 murders per week.  I don't know where all this can come from.  The citizens must assume some responsibility and help put the city on an improvement path.  I hope this is a start.</a><br>

No one is above the Law.

NO ONE.

My question is this : 
Why did this police van containing Freddie Gray take such a strangely circuitous route ?

It made many random turns, seemingly just driving around aimlessly before finally arriving at the booking station.

Is this Standard Operating Procedure for processing arrests ?  

Or was the van driver deliberately.taking him on the " Nickel Ride" to rough him up ?

I want answers !</a><br>

I think the Police Dept, and the ones who were at the highest levels, caused this - not the individual cops. The police department provided the vans  that were designed to be dangerous to those who were arrested? Look at the records of all the people who have been severely injured, costing the City of Baltimore, millions of dollars - or increased insurance rates. I can understand that the police prefer to arrest small-time criminal types - murders and rapes are too dangerous. This who le thing smells of politics, not justice.  Why not recruit the police from the Ivy League colleges, at inflated salaries? These lower middle class cops need a lot more training , and better equipment. The 6 cops arrested certainly don't look like the face of evil. </a><br>

Insight is great. Yet your online news feeds are critical and the Sun is often still hours behind the news, such as coverage of the vivid protester curfew arrests at City Hall on May 1. Live should mean live or close to. Reporter tweets and audio should be uploaded and posted much faster--this is The Sun's stage, play it front and center.</a><br>

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="" target="_blank">I grew up in Baltimore and live local to the city, I've been harrased and beaten and jailed for no reason at all. The decision for me the move away from Baltimore city wasn't because of the pimps ,dealers,pushers ,hustlers or crime at all. It was the city police department , when I was accused for panhandling when I just came home from work and walked to the corner store for coffee for the next morning. I have so many stories of the city police and I've seen them do so much I can't even wright it all down in this forum. But that's what tax paying citizens move out of this city..Because of the police. One good incident is my brother passed away  from an heroin overdose and at the time he was living with my mother who had just came home from her job. She would always call and say check on him, but this time I just got off work at 01:00 hrs and had to report back to work at 07:00hrs. So I said no o can't at this time so she begged me to because she was scared to check on him so I drove there and when I arrived there were no police there so I walked upstairs to check on him and he had already passed. At this time I noticed a full glass of water there and a full glass of iced tea that still had a little bit of ice in both cups and brother could not drink straight water so I immediately thought someone may have been there with him or still in house. At that time I was grabbed in the "L" buy someone and was literally being choked out. At that time I had flung him over my shoulder and at that time I noticed he was a police officer, I then stated I didn't know he was an officer because he did not identify him myself as one before he tried choking me to death. I said to him I'm sorry I wasn't aware you were the police  and i  helped him up  he then proceeded to grab my Adams apple and tried to rip it out of my throat continuously. I begged and pleated with him to stop and just kept trying to beat and kill me at this time I never at no time was aggressive at all ,once I knew that he was police. When more officers arrived they all decided to beat me down for no reason at all. While in the process of beating me, an officer had lost his firearm. And he slammed my mothers door and broke it in half and my mother asked him what's wrong and the officer replied that he had lost something. And my mom asked what he lost maybe she could help him look and he replied " none of your fu****g business". Now she has a dead son upstairs and another being beat up by police. I asked the officer if he could send a commanding officer to the scene and if he thinks that I broke the law in any way, he can send me to jail and the officer said OK we are going to search you and hold me in the wagon until he gets there and he put me in wagon and they drove away immediately. I was charged with hindering a crime scene( bogus).upon my release at C.B.I.F. I was robbed at gunpoint by six armed men at the door of the jail when officers were standing right there and they did absolutely nothing about it. They replied your on your own now. And they wonder why there aren't many taxpayers left in the city. Not to mention the city concentrates on ticketing the working class neighborhoods for trash,uncut grass and parking. They  don't do that on North Ave. Do you know why?</a><br>

They felt justified in looting and/or burning down people's businesses , assaulting random people and wreaking havoc on our City.    I am also sick and tired of being told that if I don't see the justification for "Black America" to behave in that manner, then I don't understand the problems.  I do understand.  I do feel for the people who work hard on a daily basis to provide for their families. I feel bad for the victims of senseless violence.   I do not understand burning down the foundation for s community center that they all say they need. I do not understand burning down the only place to get your medications.   I don't understand the people feeling justified in burning down the only place to cash their checks because " they overcharged us and they needed to go."  I don't understand lighting trash cans on fire and hurling them at the police  The Mayor allowed them to pillage their community while we all watched in disbelief.  In what community is this condoned???  There are consequences for our behaviors-good and bad.  Who will ultimately be held responsible for the rebuild in the City -taxpayers and business owners.  SRB sure isn't.  She isn't going to even pay our law enforcement or firefighters hazard pay for their service.  Those who looted, assaulted, committed arson and caused general unrest will not be held accountable.  Hell, the majority of these criminals and , dare I say , Thugs, will be let go with no consequences whatsoever because our local government wants them to know that they "feel their pain." </a><br>

I had seen a few things on social media about Freddie Gray's arrest and injuries but it wasn't until his death that I was fully aware of the situation. Hearing the full story and watching the video saddened me and broke my heart. The day of the riots I sat glued to the screen in pure and utter shock, as I watched the city I grew up in, erupt into pure chaos. I understood the frustration and motivation of the rioters and feared for the safety and wellbeing of my boyfriend and his fellow officers.  I felt as if justice needed to be served but I didn't approve of the level of violence that was reached to achieve it.  I have been praying for Baltimore, praying for black lives, praying for blue lives, and praying for all lives on a daily basis since this all began. </a><br>

When watching the events of the last couple weeks from Philadelphia, I could feel that "other Baltimore"- that as a fairly well-off white resident I was aware of but could never be a part of or understand- make its voice heard. There are too many downtrodden and forgotten folks hiding in plain sight in the inner city of Baltimore and others like Philadelphia. While nowhere near condoning any violence or destruction, I can see how the anger and resentment would manifest itself this way. Folks have a right to be upset about what Sandtown-Winchester looks like today and not everyone has the means to just "change it" like so many outsiders think they can just flip a switch and do.

I hope that the years of segregation by business and government, racism, ignorance, poverty, etc. that have led us to this point are able to be overcome. I hope that the eyes that are on Baltimore stay on Baltimore as a way to encourage positive growth and involvement from ALL communities across the city. I hope anyone frustrated with current politicians votes in the next election to make their voice heard at the ballot box too. It will only be a collection of the little things that make any big difference in the long run.

GO BALTIMORE!</a><br>

I never thought that so many officers were there and could have rendered aid to this gentleman and did not. They violated his human rights in more than one way. Our person beliefs and assumptions should be placed aside in situations like this. I felt that the arresting officer and the officers that assisted in his arrest had already injured Mr. Gray by the look of the footage of him being placed in the van. And the driver basically hung himself by transporting him and failing to seek medical attention for nr. Gray. Why did the arresting officers place Mr. Gray on the floor of the van? Was it because they already knew he was hurt and possibly could not sat on the appropriate bench? Why did they not place a seat belt on Mr. Gray since they placed him in the vehicle? Why was he even arrested? Hopefully all of these answers will come out in court. But, what has frighten me even more that his untimely murder is all of the hateful, prejudice and bias remarks displayed by the human race. Many were so hateful to believe this man's death was a victory due to him being a criminal or due to the color of his skin. Then others wanted to honor the men and women in blue as if they were Godly angels that were send from heaven to murder at free will. We must not confuse heaven and hell people. God loves us all regardless of mistakes. Help us all Lord Jesus..  </a><br>

Yes, there are a few bad ones out there that need to be weeded out. But the good far outweighs the bad, and just think how it would be without them. I think Gray was a criminal, he was probably in the act of making a drug deal. He had a warrant, for sure. The video showed no excessive force. It's a shame he died, but things probably would have different if he hadn't have ran from the police. </a><br>

Just as Mayor Rawlings Blake was slow off the mark, the local media was not informing us in real time.  Early on I had to turn to CNN.

While the SunPapers had done a great job with a long term investigation into the Baltimore City Police they failed miserably to report in Real Time.  Growing up the Evening Sun had articles that were timely, the morning Sun had the other articles.

Todays BaltimoreSun had stories that were clunking along some some days and none others.

Local TV was no better early on, game shows and TV was still normal.  CNN had the coverage.

Late in the story Local TV became better and CNN pushed to cause trouble.

Gone are the days when reporters reported.  Each outlet had an agenda, and the people suffered.

I am glad the Police were taken to task, they failed in their duty to protect Baltimore before Freddie Gray died in their possession.  Someone said it best - If I were driving a dead man around, or a dying man around and the police stopped me, I believe that I would have been arrested long before they (the police) were arrested.

That said - I would never drive a dying man around in circles, nor would I drive a dead man around.  For that the Police will have to answer - hopefully truthfully.</a><br>

If Green in New York would have complied, he would be alive. If everyone in America would just comply then Law Enforcement would not have the issues that is does today. For some reason Americans has placed morals and values on the back burner there is no respect for each other and obsessively, no respect for the Police. People have to change to. the media should teach every american what comply means. When the event is over then feel free to complain. Again the word is comply!!!!!!!!!</a><br>

I am filled with admiration and pride for the youth who have stepped up to organize the protests, and I hope they can keep their momentum going once the national spotlight fades. This is the most hopeful I've been for my adopted city in decades.</a><br>

Expecting justice? Not so quick!		
Who killed Freddy? Take your pick.	
Deciding who - is the trick.			
Will only lesser charges stick?		
A broken spine before the ride?		
“You’re hurting my neck!” Freddy cried.  	

There’s an easy way to lynch.
Knee to neck is a cinch.
We need another murder charge
So killer cop won’t be at large.
The DA said he died from the ride.
Witnesses are not satisfied.

 “Get off’a my neck” yelled Freddy Gray
As on his face was forced to lay.
“Shut the fuck up” was the hateful sound
Of 3 white cops from out of town.
They kneed his neck and hit his spine.
“You’re hurting my neck!” Freddy cried.  

 “They bent him like a pretzel” a witness said.
We saw him disabled, almost dead.
A witness said he screamed in pain.
“They killed him” said one, shouting in vain.
 We saw the videos. They don’t lie.
“You’re hurting my neck!” Freddy cried.  

 In the van, high impact
Crushed his neck, that’s a fact,
Thus concealing evidence
Of a prior severance.
A severed spine before the ride?
“You’re hurting my neck!” Freddy cried

It’s quite possible a dying man
Can talk and step into a van.
Which cop killed him? Hard to say.
So from murder, they’ll walk away.
Who killed him? There’s some doubt
That lets the killer cop walk out.

Marilyn Mosby, tell the jury
That people witnessed Freddy
Gravely injured before the ride
By arrester cops who lied.
If no murder’s found by the jury
We will see the peoples’ fury!</a><br>

<b>Tell us about your experience and how it made you feel:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);">Seo Plugin</a>&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there&#39;s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That&#39;s right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href="http://www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com">Seo Plugin</a><br>
