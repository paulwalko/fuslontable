<b>Medical Term:</b> Hormone blockers<br>
<b>Definition:</b> Begins for trans children at the first sign of puberty. It’s a pause button that allows families to decide if the child will transition genders. Puberty blockers allow development to pause for two to three years. This medical option is completely reversible. If families decide not to move forward, the blockers are stopped and the child will resume their biological puberty.

<b>Medical Term:</b> Hormone replacement therapy<br>
<b>Definition:</b> Commonly known as HRT or cross-sex hormones, is for teens deciding to transition genders. Biologically female teens will take testosterone to develop as male, and biologically male teens will take estrogen to develop as female. Unlike puberty blockers, this decision is permanent and fertility stops.

<b>Medical Term:</b> Gender reassignment surgery<br>
<b>Definition:</b> For biological females, this can involve top-surgery, which involves removing breast tissue, as well as a surgical procedure to change their genitalia. The same applies for males’ genitalia. Top surgery is the only procedure allowed for people under 18 years of age. The other surgical procedures take place as adults.
