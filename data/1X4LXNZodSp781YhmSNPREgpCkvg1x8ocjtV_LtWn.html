<b>Opponent(s):</b> Bob Beauprez, Republican<br>
<b>State CIO Assessment:</b> While the race for the Governorâ€™s seat in Colorado was hotly contested, the re-election of moderate Democrat John Hickenlooper bodes well for his relatively new slate of technology leaders: <a href="http://www.govtech.com/state/Colorado-Names-a-New-CIO.html" target="_blank">CIO and Secretary of Technology Suma Nallapati</a> assumed the role last May, with plans to leverage technology in service of efficient, customer-focused government. <a href="http://www.govtech.com/state/Colorado-Names-New-Chief-Technology-Officer.html" target="_blank">CTO David McCurdy</a>, named in August, like Nallapati, comes to the state after years of service at Catholic Health Initiatives. <br>

<b>State:</b> Connecticut<br>

<b>Opponent(s):</b> Tom Foley, Republican<br>
<b>State CIO Assessment:</b> Incumbent Gov. Dan Malloy narrowly survived a strong Republican challenge to earn a second term in office. That bodes well for state CIO Mark Raymond and his push to replace creaky old IT systems with modern shared services. When Malloy took office in 2011, the state created a $50 million IT investment fund to pay for new systems that support multiple state agencies. Nearly 30 projects are receiving money from the fund now, with more than 20 others in the pipeline. Connecticut received a top grade in the Center for Digital Government's latest Digital States Survey and was named <a href="http://www.govtech.com/state/Digital-States-2014.html" target="_blank">one of two "most improved" states in the survey</a>.<br>

<b>State CIO Assessment:</b> The Florida IT department and CIO position have been on a bit of a roller coaster ride in years past, only to have been revived this summer. In late July, Jason Allison was named the state's interim CIO and executive director of the new Agency for State Technology, which officially launched on July 1 after being signed into law on June 20. Now that Gov. Rick Scott is here to stay for another term, it's likely Allison will also stick around.<br>

During his time, Vinck played a significant role in <a href="http://www.govtech.com/computing/Michigan-and-Illinois-Forge-Historic-MMIS-Partnership.html" target="_blank">forging a Medicaid Management Information System partnership with Michigan</a> and worked with the state's chief procurement officer to develop a memorandum that would <a href="http://www.govtech.com/Will-Illinois-New-Laws-Streamline-Procurement.html" target="_blank">give state agency CIOs and purchasing officers</a> the basic procedures for looking at cloud technology purchases.<br>

<b>State CIO Assessment:</b> In Pennsylvania, Democrat Tom Wolf defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, potentially triggering changes for a state IT team that has boldly moved toward the cloud. In July, State CIO Tony Encinias announced a deal to unify seven state data centers into perhaps the largest <a href="http://www.govtech.com/computing/Pennsylvanias-Data-Center-Cloud-Deal-Has-Big-Potential.html" target="_blank">hybrid cloud deployment</a> in state government. The seven-year, $681 million project, awarded to Unisys, is intended to provide true computing-on-demand services for state agencies. Now the questions are how strongly the new administration will support the move, and whether Encinias, a 2014 <i>Government Technology </i><a href="http://www.govtech.com/top-25/Tony-Encinias-2014-GT-Top-25-Winner.html" target="_blank"> Top 25 Doer, Dreamer and Driver</a>, will be around to see it through.<br>
