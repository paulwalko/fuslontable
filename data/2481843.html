<p>Things were a lot more complicated and have taken much longer than planned. (Bamboo, it grows really fast, but takes almost forever to deliver). Sometimes I think that that is the theme of my building process. Thankfully things always work out somehow. It keeps my creative problem solving skills at their peak, too. Anyway, my neighbor with the bad back conned the driver from Puget Sound Transfer into helping carry it into the house. He says there was no visible damage to report from the outside. I elected to have him install it, as I won't be back up there till April 2nd. He's a picky old trim carpenter so I expect to be able to send you a photo of a beautiful installation for the GBS record books. Thank you for explaining what happened; surely I'm a big enough spirit to not take the wild weather personally. Thanks to all the kind gestures, it will indeed ease the pain. Your response has meant a lot to me, I really appreciate it, it keeps the spark of goodwill glowing, Carry on. A quick note to thank you for the rebate and the fine bamboo cutting board. How very thoughtful of you! Thank you! The floor turned out just peachy keen fine; I took pictures and will send them off one of these days when I practice hooking the camera up to the computer. Hope alls well in sunny Iowa, thanks again for the good faith effort to make things right. Please, love, joy, purpose, freedom and cash and prizes to you too. Sincerely,<br><br>

<p>Hi GBS,<br> I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your posts. They are well thought out, succinct and most of all, don't get around the fact that to get what you want, you must do the research and the testing, all of which takes time and attention to detail. Often, our business is fraught with guys who will tell you something wrong just to sell you something.  I am glad you are not one of those.  It makes having done business with you guys in the past, morally rewarding.<br><br>

<p>I wanted to thank you for what you are doing by having a business that helps the environment and that helps people become and stay healthier. Here's the testimony that you wanted me to write in about. I had frozen blackberries in the backseat of my car, the seat was light beige. I ran too many errands and the blackberries thawed creating juice. The bag Monaleaked so the juice went through the grocery sack and into the car seat in several places. I had some Super Clean mixed up and dipped a paper towel into the solution and put it on the blackberry spots to get wet with solution. I then took a paper towel and pressed on the spots. The blackberry spots lifted up out of the car seat. I repeated the process a couple of times until there was no sign of blackberry juice ever being on the car seat. Super Clean is wonderful stuff. I also soaked my paint brush in it that had wood stain on it and it cleaned up like new. Thank you for all you do. God bless,<br><br>

<p>Hello,<br> After a long amount of trial and error, we successfully installed the cork flooring yesterday. As you've mentioned, it is indeed beautiful. After an hour of failed attempts to get a second row, we were really starting to think the flooring was cursed.  Then we saw that in the picture, opposite to the written directions (which say to start at the left side), the flooring is installed from RIGHT to LEFT.<br><br>
After we determined that, the flooring went in pretty quickly.  The joints are indeed quite tight, so it doesn't seem like there should be any issues with the lighter amount of wax on most of the boards. We had enough flooring - our room dimensions worked in our favor.<br><br>

Thank you for all of your patience and help, I very much
appreciate it. It was one of the most troublesome pieces of the
project, but also one of the most beautiful.<br><br>

We may be crazy, but we'd like to put this in the next room, too.  So, if it is possible, it'd be great to hear from you if it happens to go on sale again.

Thanks!<br><br>

<p>Hi,<br>
I stopped by your stand at the "eco show" a couple of weeks ago. I ended up purchasing some of your cleaner Universal Stone, primarily with the purpose of cleaning my marble fireplace, which I do not think has been cleaned in decades. It came up a treat! Nothing else I have used has worked - it looks like new and your product smells great and I could not be happier. I moved on to cleaning all the brass knobs in my kitchen - great result again. I must say I was a bit shocked at the price, but truly a little goes a very very long way, so I am "loaning" it out to friends to try. Thanks again,<br><br>

<p>Just wanted to say thanks for the wonderful products. We painted the ceilings this past weekend with the clay paint. We were amazed by the absolute lack of odor and also by the appearance. The paint is very high quality; it covers extremely well in one coat and leaves a nice, soft finish. <br><br>The American Clay sanded primer is quite impressive. After just one coat, I thought we'd probably have to bring out the sandpaper and sand the acrylic bullnose edging because the primer didn't appear to be doing the trick. After the second coat, however, the bullnose was covered with a solid layer of sand. When I went back to check this morning before the plaster crew arrived, it had dried to a nice hard finish and I could tell that it adhered well to the bullnose. <br><br>I thought to myself, if American Clay plaster is half as good as the primer, we're in good shape! Then the plaster crew appeared and got straight to work. They mixed one bucket of clay with mud glue to see its workability, etc.<br><br> Then we all stood and watched as two of the guys began applying it. In about 30 minutes flat, they had the entire entryway covered, which consists of about 500 SF of wall space. It looked beautiful after just one coat, before it even dried. They said it's very easy to work with. I can't wait to go back tonight and see the progress!<br><br>                          Thanks again for the lovely service and wonderful products! I'll be placing an order for a bit more paint later this week. Thanks for chatting with me when I was about to chicken out: on the plaster! I'm so happy that I stuck with my original thought. Needless to say, we're eager to move. Thanks again for the great service! Warmly,<br><br>

<p>I ordered a 3-Part Comprehensive Carpet Shampoo &amp; Sealing System  from GBS. I had been unable to find anything which would seal a large area of the platform at the front of our church which was carpet glued to plywood. I was unable to be in the building for more than a few minutes, and had headaches and sore throat after leaving.<br><br>
 
After the application of the 3-part process, I was not only able to be in church, but to actually sit and stand on the platform with no ill effects.<br><br>
 
Wonderful product, and the staff was so helpful in explaining the use and sending to my pastor and they were just as helpful assisting me with a paint and primer purchase....and I expect the quality of these items to match that of the sealer.<br><br>
 
GBS is a much-needed company, and I have found both the product and the customer service to be 5-star.<br><br>

<p>My husband and I want you to know that I am writing my story about the experiences I have had attempting to do a green remodel as someone who is chemically and environmentally sensitive. We will be submitting my story to several venues, and the decorator who helped us with color choices is also taking some of my story to submit to some trade and local magazines.<br><br>

Though our story is not quite finished yet (we are still finishing the project as I imagine you are aware), we want you to know that Green Building Supply and your sales team will be mentioned clearly, concisely, and with incredible praise and gratitude.  Having these health problems makes life exceedingly challenging, and GBS and Derrick have been and continue to be a lifesaver for us. We are so grateful for everything he has done for us, and everything your company has done and continues to do for us, and we intend to promote you in any way we can.<br><br>

Having worked for 25 years in the customer service/retail industry before injuries and health related issues sent me on a different career path, gives me a profound and thorough understanding of what it takes to make customers happy, and how difficult the public can be to work with. The service we have received from you is truly the very best customer service in a retail setting I have EVER received.<br><br>

All of your responsible for making GBS function every day have our utmost gratitude, and when we have finally written, edited, and have a final draft of the various forms of this story, I will send them to you prior to submission so you can share any thoughts you might have. Lastly, there are likely to be some questions about products we've purchased from you, so hopefully you and I can speak on the phone when I have some specific questions to ask so we can highlight things that worked for us.<br><br>

In the meantime - thank you, thank you, thank you, and we will be in touch. With warmest regards,<br><br>

<p>The two apartments are finished and the floors are beautiful. The flooring shipment via UPS had to have been dropped in the process of moving it with a fork lift. That is the only way that the pallets could have been smashed into small pieces. Also, receiving it in a long window of time and late in the day with my worker not able to be present was stressful. Because of that I went into a lot of research on  how I could get it from a local supplier and from a close by warehouse. I finally found a flooring dealer 10 miles away that enthusiastically supports Khars flooring and is an authorized distributorship of Kahrs flooring and gets the flooring from a warehouse about 100 miles away. The flooring was picked up yesterday in a little over 1 hour from the flooring dealer by my employee in perfect condition at his convenience for two more apartments without any of the shipping problems mentioned above, and gave me the good experience that I have been seeking for quite some time.
I appreciate the help I got from you in getting me there.<br><br>

<p>As a Professional Engineer I was interested in testing all the claims for Radiant Barriers and Paintable Radiant Barriers, before I installed one in my own home. I tested the following 4 products, 3 paintable radiant barriers and 1 foil barrier over the course of about a year. The foil worked well for the equivalent of the first 2 years on an accelerated testing program. This involved adding dust over the course of 3 months. Effectiveness dropped to 46% for a 5 year period. The next test was a Paintable Radiant Barrier, "Radiance," according to the product MSDS sheet the formulation contains "Formaldehyde" the product tested well but I would not subject my family or employees to this chemical. I also found some of the graphs and charts on their website useless and full of discrepancies.
Next product test was "Heatshield" www.heatshieldr20.com the website is full of a tremendous amount of misinformation. According to their MSDS the product has a 300 psi crush strength but claim it can be sprayed. We tested using a Graco 795 airless sprayer, with an average operating pressure of 2,571 psi at the tip. A density test was performed, it showed 58% of the glass bubbles were crushed at this pressure. The product worked well when applied by roller, but rated very low when sprayed.
The last product tested was Radiosity 3000, www.Radiosity.biz the website is a true presentation of the product (no unsubstantiated space age claims). According to the MSDS the product has a crush strength of 3,000 psi as the name implies. Same testing was performed as above, using the same Graco airless at an average operating pressure of 2,579 psi at the tip. Doing the same density test 3.2% of the bubbles were crushed. I had a contractor apply Radiosity in my attic this past spring. My summer A/C bills have been 31% lower than the same 4 months last year.
My interior and exterior will be painted next year, after seeing the results I've seen with this product I will have it mixed in with both interior and exterior paint.<br><br>

Thanks again for all your help.<br><br>

<p>I just wanted to take a minute this morning to tell you that Millennium Surfaces did a fantastic job in all aspects of providing new Cambria kitchen countertops at Fox Lane in Iowa City. They started with what I would consider a very high-tech laser measurement, progressed to fabrication, then installation, and finally  modification; all on-time and seamless with good communication from all the office staff.<br><br>

The kitchen configuration at Fox Lane is a bit unusual but they were able to install and modify one edge in a very professional, experienced manner. They were and are very knowledgeable, cooperative, hard-working, and they do outstanding work. The seams are essentially invisible.<br><br>

We also greatly appreciated your help in the design and color-selection of the countertops. We hope you will stop by once the new appliances are in (probably late May - but we will let you know!)  Best of luck!<br><br>

<p>I wish I could tell you the number of times people have walked in the door at our radio station and their breath has been taken away just seeing the floor, and taking the vibe all in one lady hadn't been in for a year and she just went on and on and on a community radio person from Australia you have no idea how much this place has grown, she said
still shaking her head when she left, mainly about the physical change it was just a dream before, she said, and now you're really doing it. Thank you so much for your donation to KRUU. Every time I come in, I feel the same way every time we play the Green Building Supply underwriting spot... we're working to get everything up to that level.<br>

We have great plans for this year as well with the new tower, new windows, new shows, new underwriters, but I'll save that till next year. All blessings to the whole GBS family,<br><br>

<p>Just to let you know we received the pallet on Thursday from a VERY nice driver (love the shipping company) and couldn't be more pleased with the floor.<br><br>    We've started on prep already (you know we're excited when the usual 3-month procrastination doesn't take place!!) and I'll call you if we run into any bumps. We found the installation guide online on the ecotimber website.<br><br>         Thank you so much and we look forward to doing business with you again.<br><br>

<p>Sorry to take so long to get back to you - I'd been away from my email.

Your sales staff handled my call and the situation very efficiently. 

This experience and your handling of it guarantees that when any needed building supply is not stocked locally, I will check with Green Building Supply before all others. Thank you for the quality service your company provides.

PS - Your sales staff does a great job representing your company.<br><br>

<p>Just wanted to say that the cork + wood flooring we ordered arrived as described and timely, and are just lovely, and that the common carrier, after a slight hiccup (quickly remedied) was a pleasure to work with - they even delivered the materials into the garage and waited without complaint during the inspection. We're mostly through the installation and all looks great so far. Thank you!<br><br>
