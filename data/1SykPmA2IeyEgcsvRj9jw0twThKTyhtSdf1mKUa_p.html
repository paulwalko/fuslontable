SAN Twr attempted contact with SDPD dispatch but never reached a dispatcher due to being on hold +10 minutes. SAN Twr requested helo to fly the area to determine if the UAV was still airbourne. Helo was advised by their dispatch that San Diego Unified School District Police (SDUSP) advised it was an employee of SD School District flying the UAV taking photos of the school roof. I advised citizen of the SDUSP dispatch that UAV operations are not authorized at the school location because it is located in San Diego Class Bravo airspace. Additional information was given to citizen pertaining to UAS operations and the waiver process. She did not know how high the district employee was flying the UAV but would relay the information to him. No aircraft were involved.<br>
