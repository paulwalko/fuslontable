<b>Details:</b> The spectrum lease agreement for the <strong>Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System Authority</strong> (LA-RICS) was reinstated on June 27, 2013. | LA-RICS is a modern, wireless voice and data communications system that will support 34,000 first responders and protect the region's 10 million residents and 26 million annual visitors, according to the project's website. It provides day-to-day radio communications service for individual public safety agencies, enables interoperability among member agencies and mutual aid providers, and supports communication with regional, state and federal agencies in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. Key information FirstNet intends to learn from this project includes how best to utilize secondary responders in the deployment and operation of its network, and how to prioritize access to the network depending on the nature of the incident.<br><br>

<b>Jurisdiction/Entity:</b> Charlotte, N.C.<br>
<b>FirstNet Lease Status:</b> <strong>NOT APPROVED</strong><br>
<b>Color code:</b> 3<br>
<b>Date of Appointment:</b> 2014-02-01<br>
<b>Details:</b> The spectrum lease agreement for <strong>Charlotte, N.C</strong>., was not reinstated | Charlotte&#39;s LTE project had been in the works for years when it applied to be a FirstNet testbed. At the time its original lease was suspended in May 2012, the city was ready to deploy a 39 cell site LTE radio access network, among other technologies. Ultimately, when city officials were planning the network several years ago, they valued its reliability to be worth a premium of $5-$10 per month per user over the $45-$50 per month rate for unlimited data charged by commercial carriers. The Charlotte network was &quot;designed to survive the roughest of conditions, with priority and preemption promised to public safety.&quot;<br><br>

<b>Details:</b> The spectrum lease agreement for the <strong>Bay Area Regional Interoperable Systems Authority</strong> (BayRICS)/Motorola Solutions Inc. was not reinstated | BayRICS is working to build a regional data communications network that would put smart phone technology in the hands of police, fire and other public safety agencies, according to its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bayrics.net/about.html">website</a>.  It would enable first responders to share text, pictures, real-time video and other mobile apps designed for public safety.  As a separate network dedicated to public safety, BayRICS would be more secure and less prone to failure during a disaster than today's commercial networks.<br><br>
