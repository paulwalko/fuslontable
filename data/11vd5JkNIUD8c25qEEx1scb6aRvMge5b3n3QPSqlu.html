<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Fairfax County, Va.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> This year’s standard-bearer in the large counties category, Fairfax County, Va., moved up from third place in 2014 to earn the top spot on the strength of a variety of its programs. Transparency shines as a county priority, with robust and usable open data that provide a telling look into community demographics, via apps like the <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Demographic Interactive Mapper</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Community Easy Stats</a>. When it comes to the openness of its finances, Fairfax County also earns high marks. Its <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">budget site</a> offers full visibility into the budget life cycle, including details on revenues, procurement and expenditures. The county’s move to the cloud can be seen in an enterprise switch to Microsoft Office 365, which helps position it to serve a more mobile workforce. In addition, the Board of Supervisors is now up to speed with a cloud-based tool that makes all board materials available securely from any browser. Other Fairfax County subcommittees are now getting on board as well, saving reams of paper and increasing accessibility.<br> 
  
Fairfax County also leads the National Capital Region project, a network that connects all area jurisdictions and partners, allowing secure, real-time cross-agency communications. Boasting 99.9 percent availability since 2010, the system ensures all participants have access to the same emergency management, public safety and law enforcement data.<br>

<b>Place:</b> 2nd Place, 500,000 or more population<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Montgomery County, Md.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> A perennial high-achiever in the Digital Counties Survey, Montgomery County, Md., held on to the second place spot that it earned in 2014. There’s no shortage of evidence as to why. July 2014 saw the county retire its mainframe, freeing up more than $1 million in annual licensing costs. In order to do so, the county upgraded its final mainframe-dependent applications: tax assessment, health and criminal justice. Each new system was developed in-house at significant cost savings and offers new technologies that better serve the county’s needs. Employees are also in the midst of migrating to <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Microsoft Office 365</a> in the cloud, a training-intense process expected to be complete by the end of this year. <p> 
 
The past year has been a busy one for the county’s financial transparency efforts too, as several new tools are now available for those who seek a deeper understanding of where their tax dollars go. An <a href="http://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/CCLIFP/" target="_blank">Interactive Fiscal Plan</a>  lets residents test their skills at balancing the budget and see the complex consequences from any one decision. In addition, the county has launched two additional sites offering a granular level of detail on financial decisions: <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">budgetMontgomery</a> and spendingMontgomery. The county is also taking a data-driven approach to improving online customer satisfaction, including visitors to the primary website, the 311 site and the websites of the County Council. The yearlong project measured customer satisfaction, reviewed the main contributors to visitor satisfaction and took steps to increase satisfaction, and ultimately scored some admirable results: Overall satisfaction increased by almost 15 percent. Expect to hear more in the coming year about Montgomery County’s growing number of efforts to pilot Internet of Things technologies.<br>

<b>Place:</b> 2nd Place, 500,000 or more population<br>
<b>Category:</b> 2<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> San Diego County, Calif.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> San Diego County, Calif., unveiled a new <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">website</a> last year featuring responsive design and a clean, updated look. Among the innovative apps offered to San Diego County citizens is Finding Rover, which uses facial recognition to help locate lost pets. The county’s emergency mobile app logged nearly 75,000 new users during the May 2014 wildfires, during which the county sent out 2.5 million push notifications, while the emergency website, which suffered no downtime during the event, got more than 2.4 million hits. A new internal-facing app is also getting results in the county’s Probation Department. Understanding that recidivism decreases with more contact with probation officers, the app allows officers to update case records during visits, rather than back at the office. The initial pilot surpassed goals to increase officer productivity by 50 percent.<p> 
  
In an effort to effectively make decisions regarding the county’s growing cloud portfolio (the number of cloud solutions used has almost doubled since 2012), a Cloud Review Committee now evaluates all cloud services and intervenes when needed to keep projects on course. Meanwhile, the Health and Human Services Agency took aim at the accidental disclosure of confidential information that has plagued so many agencies and private-sector companies across the country. Data loss prevention software detects confidential information on employee machines, alerting them and requiring a conscious decision on their part to move the data to another location. Those who say yes will have their action logged for department review.<br>

<b>Place:</b> 3rd Place, 500,000 or more population<br>
<b>Category:</b> 3<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Oakland County, Mich.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Inching up one spot from its place in the 2014 survey, Oakland County, Mich., hangs its hat on a number of programs, including a countywide social media strategy (including a social media <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">landing page</a>) that includes employee training on official policy and account governance guidelines, ensuring consistent branding and value to citizens. Social media strategy follows the “80/20 rule,” in which 80 percent of shared posts are generated by the community and the remaining 20 percent come from government. The county's website took top honors in the Center for Digital Government’s <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">2014 Best of the Web</a> competition, bolstered in part by site navigation that immediately leads visitors to what they seek in 95 percent of use cases. <p> 
 
Sharing seems to be at the heart of most of Oakland County’s efforts. One prime example is the <a href="https://www.g2gmarket.com/%E2%80%9D%20target=">G2G (Government to Government) Marketplace</a>, where the county offers applications and services on demand to governments that might not have the resources to purchase and/or operate the same solutions onsite. More than 250 public entities in 33 states are registered on G2G to date. Similarly, Oakland County participated in the creation of the Cybersecurity Assessment for Everyone (CySAFE) tool, which allows governments to evaluate their cybersecurity posture against common frameworks to understand their readiness and gain support for needed upgrades. In addition, the county’s Courts and Law Enforcement Management Information System (CLEMIS) links criminal justice and public safety agencies within the county and beyond using common applications.<br>

<b>Category:</b> 3<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Sacramento County, Calif.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> It’s another strong showing for Sacramento County, Calif., in this year’s survey, up from a fourth place finish last year. The Sacramento County website is feature-rich, allowing site visitors to complete more than 50 types of transactions online. And statistics prove the public is taking advantage of these options, as the county reports a 15 percent increase in online transactions over the previous year. For example, 8,000 business license and building permit applications were filed in 2014 using the <a href="http://www.saccounty.net/Pages/default.aspx%E2%80%9D%20target=">portal</a>, during which time 34,700 parcel owners took care of property taxes using the EPropTax application. The county also serves as a lead partner in a regional GIS cooperative formed in 2000 and managed by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. The partnership enables a multilayered map featuring a variety of standard parcel data, as well as trash pickup and water service information. Recent upgrades to the county’s ERP system include the automation of new staff onboarding paired with expansion of the employee self-service portal online. The county rounds out its ambitious IT agenda with an aggressive and comprehensive cybersecurity program, composed of a host of solutions across the network spectrum: perimeter, network, host, application and data.<br>

<b>Place:</b> 4th Place, 500,000 or more population<br>
<b>Category:</b> 4<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Wake County, N.C.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Moving up four spots from <a href="javascript:void(0);">last year’s Digital Counties Survey</a> is Wake County, N.C., which this year was highlighted for its diverse and broad-based <a href="javascript:void(0);">open data portal</a>. The portal includes highly curated and accurate data sets related to GIS, permitting and restaurant inspections, among others, that are being used to produce collaborative results with citizens and county staff. Also of note for this year’s fourth place winner in the 500,000 population or more category is its regional collaboration for E911 services. Partnering with the city of Raleigh, the two jurisdictions created the Raleigh-Wake County Emergency Communications Center, which has the second-highest 911 call volume in the state. Over the past two years, Raleigh officials and the Wake Emergency Communications Organization have collaborated to produce a partnership that benefited both entities by upgrading the communication center’s 800-MHz public safety radio system; planning to open a new Critical Public Safety Building in Raleigh in early 2016; replacing, through joint funding, the communication center’s outdated computed-aided dispatch system; creating a new position at the communication center to serve as co-project manager with Raleigh staff to streamline project tasks; and creating city, county and advisory board agreements for governing the aforementioned systems and various services. County officials say these changes signal a new era of collaboration between the city and county in the critical area of citizen safety.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Bexar County, Texas<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Bexar County, Texas, population 1.8 million, has moved up three spots from last year’s survey, due in part to its succinct <a href="javascript:void(0);">Bexar County Business Analyst</a>, an online interactive map designed for anyone interested in the county’s current demographics or market-related data, calling it very handy and informative. Also of note is the Bexar County <a href="javascript:void(0);">Bexar County’s GIS Open Data Portal</a>, primarily because of the resource sharing and collaboration with ArcGIS Open Data.

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> King County, Wash.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Jumping five spots from the 2014 survey is King County, Wash., which boasts a succinct and very functional <a href="javascript:void(0);">Puget Sound Trip Planner app</a>, which helps both residents and visitors plan a transit trip, find the best stops and see the next departure times on all modes of transportation — bus, train, light rail, streetcar, ferry, water taxi and monorail. In addition to being a helpful on-the-go tool for travelers, the app also is an excellent example of cross-agency collaboration, as it includes regional transportation data from 11 area transit agencies. The county’s constituent relationship management (CRM) system manages interactions with customers, using technology to organize, automate and synchronize records. This enterprisewide CRM tool increases customer service and collaboration throughout the county by offering a “no wrong door” service: Questions can be received, assigned and assured of completion in the CRM system, no matter which department they originate from. This solution allows for the tracking, monitoring and reporting on any issue’s progress, as well as the ability to track trends by issue type, agency, resident and neighborhood.<br>

<b>Category:</b> 4<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Orange County, Fla.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> After dropping off the winner’s list in 2014, Orange County, Fla., has made a strong comeback in this year’s survey. Its overall citizen outreach and inclusion program — which has many initiatives — is considered the start of the county’s move toward civic innovation. In addition to launching an improved <a href="http://www.orangecountyfl.net/Newsroom.aspx" target="_blank">OC Newsroom website</a> complete with featured stories, statements on key issues and a photo gallery, the county also launched an accompanying smartphone app and a regular newsletter from Mayor Teresa Jacobs. In addition to pushing information out to its citizens, Orange County also launched a website that includes all available volunteer opportunities by topic and location. Also, the mayor’s new Technology and Social Media Workgroup will operate as a think tank to advance new technologies, social media and mobile applications, and also will collaborate on how to best enhance online public engagement and support the region's growing technology and digital community. The security improvements and big data plans currently in place will be beneficial going forward. For its big data initiative, large volumes of information from multiple systems are aggregated and processed on a daily basis, and through the use of custom programs, staff members can cross reference and identify activity based on active threats. The county also is implementing technology that processes structured and unstructured data using a visual analytics system with machine learning capabilities, which allows for intelligent searching and communication analysis for investigations and e-discovery of data throughout the enterprise.<br>

<b>Place:</b> 7th Place, 500,000 or more population<br>
<b>Category:</b> 4<br>
<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Alameda County, Calif.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Ranking seventh for the second year in a row, Alameda County has implemented numerous tech initiatives over the years with a heavy focus on citizen engagement, open data and transparent government. The county continues to add features and update ongoing projects. For example, it refreshed its <a href="https://data.acgov.org/" target="_blank">open data portal</a>  
in 2014 (originally launched in 2012), highlighting more than 200 data sets, including crime reports and restaurant inspections. In addition, it’s employing responsive design to make websites mobile friendly. A variety of Web and mobile apps aim to make key information and tools — like voter data and issue reporting — easy for residents to access. Internal and external hackathons help the county innovate and develop new tools for both employees and residents. The public-facing AC Apps Challenge has included 440 participants in the last three years, leading to 62 app ideas and eight working apps. The internal hackathon, Rethink AC, brings together employees from across different departments to create new tools, like a one-stop shop for permits that’s currently being developed. Additional initiatives include partnering with a nearby county for reciprocal hosting for disaster recovery and business continuity infrastructure, as well as investing in enterprisewide network upgrades to improve uptime of critical systems used by departments, including police and fire. Numerous programs seek to reach young residents about tech opportunities and civic engagement. The student intern program, for example, has challenged participants to create apps that benefit the community, and the Youth Leadership Academy educates high-school students about the county’s programs and services.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Baltimore County, Md.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Falling one place since last year’s survey, Baltimore County is working to reduce redundancy and increase the usability of online services for residents. An in-house redesign of the <a href="http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov%20%E2%80%9D%20target=">county portal</a>  
went live this year, featuring an emphasis on search and responsive design. An upcoming move to a Microsoft Enterprise agreement will consolidate 13 apps and is estimated to save the county $1.5 million every two years after implementation. The technology department has also developed workforce efficiencies through a Document Management Center and Council Action Request Form, helping to deliver services faster. In addition, Web services aim to increase transparency, including online council session videos and services platforms for code enforcement and land management records. Technology also is enabling field staff members to be more effective and efficient: Public works and animal control employees can complete work orders and citations while in the field; emergency medical services workers can securely transmit vital data to hospitals prior to arrival; and an equipment upgrade allows firefighters to receive CAD data and access an internal reporting system while responding to an incident.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Snohomish County, Wash.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Snohomish County is proof that tech investments pay off. A GIS program established in 1992 set the stage for what’s now more than 260 data sets and 500 GB of aerial images — an investment that proved invaluable during the devastating mudslide in March 2014. This information helped the county produce maps and images to aid search and rescue efforts, while also aiding public education about the incident. Recent tech initiatives include the launch of the county’s first redesigned <a href="http://snohomishcountywa.gov%E2%80%9D%20target=">website</a>  
in 10 years, which has shown an increase from 3.1 million to 5.3 million page views annually since it went live in February 2014. In addition, a <a href="http://snohomishcountywa.gov/1704/Public-Records%E2%80%9D%20target=">public records portal</a>  
provides a menu of accessible data, helping with the 1,700 public records requests that are made annually. An expanded cloud computing strategy includes the county’s transition to Microsoft Office 365, and it’s employing Skype for Business (formerly Lync) for digital communications outside of email.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Pierce County, Wash.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> From its cloud-first strategy to using apps and Web resources to promote sustainable agriculture and farming to launching self-service Web-based tools, Pierce County has embraced a multipronged approach to technology. The county reworked its permit inspection process, enlisting self-service tools on its website, which has reduced the number of citizen visits and phone calls to county offices by 25 percent. In addition, an app for inspectors provides easy access to real-time information via iPads, and video chat tools like Skype and FaceTime allow minor inspections to happen remotely. Self-service tools are also streamlining court services, including allowing residents to schedule traffic hearings online and use live chat to get answers to court-related questions. To increase situational awareness during emergencies, Pierce County responders now use the FirstToSee app to send reports from the field. The Oso landslide in March 2014 was the app's first real-world test, during which it helped confirm the identities of survivors and keep track of who was missing. The cloud-based system is GPS-enabled and integrates with social media so responders know what the public is posting about. The county has also been recognized for its contributions to open government. An online list of available records provides information to the public, and a <a href="http://gisdata.piercecowa.opendata.arcgis.com/%E2%80%9D%20target=">GIS open data portal</a> includes more than 300 data sets, replacing the process of a GIS technician responding to individual requests for information.<br>

Public safety initiatives include the move to a Project 25 communications system that’s compatible with the systems of neighboring governments and a radio policy that standardizes communications between emergency medical services personnel and hospitals. In addition, an automated referral system for the county’s hospital eliminates manual processes and improves data accuracy and integrity. San Bernardino is working to replace its more than 20-year-old ERP and is also focused on desktop and server virtualization.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Minnesota’s largest county turned in another strong performance this year. Hennepin County has finished among the top 10 in the survey’s large county category since 2009. Accomplishments for 2015 include a centralized housing portal, an upgraded election results application, and an automated citations and charging system. The Hennepin Housing Key is a Web-based application that offers a single database of housing assets operated by the county and nonprofit organizations. The mobile-friendly portal lets residents or their advocates search an inventory of more than 8,000 housing units. Housing providers can enter and update their inventory in real time. A new election night Web page integrates previously separate GIS and text-based information; a simplified back end lets the new site offer election returns faster, and new tools let users access detailed data on voter turnout and demographics. Finally, new eCitation and eFiling technology is removing paper from the criminal justice system. Officers from local police departments enter citation information into the system from their squad cars. And the County Attorney’s Office, as well as the Minneapolis City Attorney’s Office, can file charges with the court electronically.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Westchester County, N.Y.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Westchester continues to be a tech leader among large counties. The county recently deployed several innovative public safety applications. The Shared Criminal Justice Data Warehouse lets local public safety agencies manage, share and analyze vital information, including city and county police information, jail and probation data, pistol permits, and taxi and limousine records. The county’s new Inmate Mental Health Data Exchange automatically alerts jail staff when an inmate has a history of mental health issues, and provides staff with diagnosis and medication information. The exchange also notifies the county Department of Community Mental Health of the individual’s incarceration and release date, so the department can provide transition services. Westchester’s Department of Information Technology also offers a growing number of shared services to area cities and schools. For instance, last year the department began offering local municipalities no-cost licenses to Symantec Protection Suite cybersecurity software. And the county’s contract for multifunction copiers is used by many of the cities and school districts within the jurisdiction.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Consistent IT investment guided by comprehensive planning powered Chesterfield County to the top of its population category. A “Blueprint Chesterfield” strategic plan completed last year guides the county’s Technology Improvement Program and other activities. Through a partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University, master’s students in information management recently reviewed the county IT department for effectiveness, risk management and innovation. Findings from the assessment will be considered for the 2016 budget cycle. A comprehensive upgrade of the core network connecting county government buildings boosted bandwidth from 1 GB to 10 GB, building a foundation for app modernization over the next decade. In addition, the core network upgrade facilitated replacement of Chesterfield’s public Wi-Fi network that’s available in libraries, county buildings, parks, training centers and meeting spaces. The county also boosted security of its internal networks by implementing two-factor authentication for staff.

Among the services offered by the Office of Central and Information Services (OCIS) are website development, PC/server tech services, network services, software development and IT assessments. OCIS completed website redesigns for two cities last year and signed a long-term agreement with the Arlington Fire District – in the town of Poughkeepsie – to provide comprehensive IT services. The county upgraded its popular <a href="http://www.co.dutchess.ny.us/CountyGov/GIS.htm" target="_blank">GIS portal</a> late last year, adding features like the ability to view maps by categories such as education, government, health care, recreation and transportation. In 2014, the GIS site served more than 6.7 million pages to county users, local municipalities and businesses, according to the county.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Moving from second to fourth place this year, Loudon County’s five-year IT strategic plan sets the stage for 2015-2019, highlighting key initiatives like transitioning to a software-defined data center and enhancing online services and public access to data. Interactive tools on the county’s site help residents with tasks like understanding changes to flood insurance rates and zoning districts. A new online tool rolled out in December 2014 allows residents to submit questions and requests to county employees to enhance customer service and transparency. A CAD2CAD project started in 2007 addresses communications interoperability in the National Capital Region. The project allows emergency calls to be automatically transferred to another emergency communications center if the county's is unable to respond. Phase two of the implementation of a new financial system is under way and will include the transition of payroll and HR benefits information for the county’s more than 4,000 employees and 14,000 school employees. Phase one was completed in 2013 and has since helped improve functionality in a number of areas like producing ad hoc reports from the financial database.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Holding steady at sixth place is Richland County, S.C., which was called out this year for its strong and appropriate emphasis on security. During the last year or so, approximately 1,000 Richland County employees were enrolled in a cybersecurity training program by the SANS Institute called Securing the Human, in which the emphasis is awareness on today's weakest link in enterprise security — people. The county saw an approximately 40 percent completion rate for its first year and plans on expanding the internal cybersecurity training next year to move toward a higher completion rate. Richland County also takes public safety very seriously, as shown by its Internet of Things-based network of professional-grade automated weather monitoring stations located throughout the county. Called RCWINDS (Richland County Weather Information Network Data System) the sensor network’s <a href="javascript:void(0);">website</a> provides live and historic weather data at dozens of locations countywide.

The county took the lead, and the Map Forsyth project was born. Among the many tools developed in subsequent years is <a href="http://mapforsyth.org/projects.aspx" target="_blank">GeoData Explorer</a>, a searchable, interactive map that identifies school locations, zoning data, flood zones, topography and more. Forsyth County rolled out Google email in the cloud, along with a comprehensive employee communications campaign that explained its cost savings, potential for collaboration and anywhere, anytime availability. In addition, IT staff helped the Social Services Department move past its cumbersome paper process to admit a child into protective services. The intake process went from days to hours, thanks to a new Web app that enables real-time collaboration from any location.

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Catawba County’s numerous tech initiatives — public-facing, internal and cross-government collaborations — helped it take first place in its population category. The <a href="http://www.catawbacountync.gov/datasets/%E2%80%9D%20target=">open data site</a>  
makes public information easy to access, and a <a href="http://gis.catawbacountync.gov/%E2%80%9D%20target=">GIS portal</a> ranks as the county’s most popular Web page, with more than 2.5 million page views per month. In addition, a <a href="http://maps.co.alexander.nc.us/regional/%E2%80%9D%20target=">regional GIS website</a> is the result of a collaboration between Catawba and its surrounding counties to eliminate the need for people to visit multiple sites for property information and other data. The county leverages online communications through multiple social media accounts, an initiative that began in 2008. The different accounts focus on specific services, like parks and animal services; the approach helps the agencies target different audiences. A <a href="http://www.catawbacountync.gov/budget/PerformanceDashboard.swf%E2%80%9D%20target=">performance dashboard</a> promotes transparency by tracking key metrics for the county’s different service areas, helping Catawba benchmark itself against other municipalities and allowing for public education.

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Arlington County moved up two places from last year’s survey as it works to use technology to make it easier for residents to interact with government. A digital strategy for 2015-2020 outlines the county’s goal of using technology to enable service delivery. For example, a mobile payment parking system works with the county’s 4,500 metered parking spaces to allow people to pay via an app and receive alerts when their time is about to expire. A new secure email system allows government employees to initiate encrypted email conversations with accounts not on the county network, like those from Gmail. Arlington County considers this to be a critical service, especially in the area of human services. Other public-facing initiatives include the <a href="https://propertysearch.arlingtonva.us/%E2%80%9D%20target=">property search portal</a>, which is one of the county’s most used websites, and the <a href="https://capp.arlingtonva.us/%E2%80%9D%20target=">Customer Assessment and Payment Portal</a>, which is available for residents to pay bills and file taxes online.

The formation of a GIS District will foster collaboration and promote data sharing across parish agencies and all levels of government. For example, the district will be able to set GIS data standards. In addition, cloud-based systems are helping to expand services. The permitting system has been moved to the cloud, allowing citizens and contractors to conduct numerous tasks online, and cloud-based code enforcement services enable officers to complete inspections in the field and provide an easy way for citizens to track complaints. The parish is gearing up to undertake one of its largest technology projects to date with the implementation of a new ERP. It is currently working with a vendor and expects to select a software product by the end of the year.<br>

The county’s Wi-Fi initiative — in which Wi-Fi hotspots have been placed in strategic locations throughout the county — is a huge community benefit. After the initial hotspots went live, local businesses began asking to sponsor more county-managed hotspots. Lackawanna also has made headway in next-gen 911: In 2014, its 911 management team embarked on a project to allow text-to-911 and can now accept text messages from the four major carriers: AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Lackawanna County also believes in transparent government, so it created the <a href="javascript:void(0);">Ordinance Archive</a>, which contains every county ordinance ever created in digital downloadable format. And in an effort to reduce technology costs, the county began a wireless initiative that aimed to build a network of all sites in the county without making fiber connections to each site. That network became a reality in 2014, and came with a viable byproduct: bulk unused Internet bandwidth, which the county is reselling at a competitive rate to help businesses, school districts, medical institutions, etc., reduce their technology costs.<br>

One such example is its regional <a href="http://eresponse.berriencounty.org/mobileWelcome.aspx?val=N">online jury system</a> that lets residents check online to see if they need to report for jury duty; by the end of summer, Berrien will host online jury reporting for three neighboring counties, and expects that to expand. Berrien also has built secure VPNs to all 39 local agencies, allowing them to securely access county and state information through the county network. And when it comes to public safety, Berrien has many programs in place, such as installing life preserver rings at a local beach that will soon be monitored 24/7 by security cameras to prevent misuse and theft, ensuring they are readily available for citizen use. Berrien County Dispatch also has access to live feeds from the security cameras of local area schools, which can help direct emergency responders should an event occur. And in addition to its main emergency operations center, the county also has a backup EOC should the main EOC be rendered useless or unavailable.

A cloud-based identity management service provides simplified sign-on for hosted services. And the county recently upgraded its unified communications platform, opening up new options for county employees to work remotely. The platform enables voice calls, instant messaging and video conferencing on any device, anywhere in the world.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Dona Ana County launched a social media initiative last year and hired a social media technician to expand and coordinate citizen engagement activities across platforms. The county now has active accounts on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to interact with residents and businesses. A paperless workflow system implemented in the County Assessor’s Office is streamlining processes for citizens and internal staff. And the county has outsourced its property tax payment and employee recruiting systems. The new tax payment platform offers multiple payment options, including online payments, as well as lower operational costs and better security and fraud protection. The new recruiting system automates portions of the applicant screening process and streamlines performance evaluations, helping the county hire and retain talent more effectively. <br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Jackson County took steps to improve transparency and upgrade internal systems over the past year. A Web-based <a href="http://www.co.jackson.mi.us/dashboard/" target="_blank">Digital Dashboard</a> tracks quality-of-life metrics and offers detailed information on county revenue collection and spending, while an online <a href="http://www.mygovhelp.org/JACKSONCOUNTYMI/_cs/Site.aspx" target="_blank">Citizen Support Center</a> gives residents an easy way to find information, ask questions and request services. Behind the scenes, the county implemented significant new systems to strengthen internal operations. A new ERP delivers upgraded services, better financial data and improved audit capabilities. A new emergency dispatch system is part of a state-of-the-art 911 call center that opened this year. The county also has virtualized most of its servers and recently deployed a new storage area network. In addition, document imaging technology is reducing paper in the county clerk and prosecutor’s offices. <br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Allegan County, Mich.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Jumping eight spots from last year’s survey to take the lead in the smallest population category this year is Allegan County, Mich., which now offers 27 different online services – the most notable of which is its online <a href="javascript:void(0);">GIS Data Library</a>. This library includes the county’s entire suite of GIS maps, layers and shapefiles, which citizens and customers can download at no cost. Judges also were drawn to the county’s <a href="javascript:void(0);">Connect with Us</a> social media portal, where users are presented with a consolidated list of all social media sites. Also of note is Allegan’s collaboration with Kent and Ottawa counties on procurement, through which it actively participates in and advocates for the use of a reverse auction process for commodity acquisition. This solution and the consortium created by these three counties serves as a model for other municipalities across the state of Michigan. Allegan County also actively maintains a <a href="javascript:void(0);">public performance dashboard</a> with key indicators and budget reports that it can use to measure and learn from outcomes.<br>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> Nevada County, Calif.<br>
<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Moving up the ranks from fifth place in the 2014 survey for the smallest population category to second this year is Nevada County, Calif., whose <a href="http://goo.gl/OfvGd2" target="_blank">Landmark Story Map</a> uses GIS data to take users on a virtual tour of the county’s historical landmarks using both computers and mobile devices. The county also boasts a comprehensive citizen engagement effort, called the Citizen Participation Initiative, that includes an integrated solution between its SharePoint platform and Facebook, LinkedIn and blogs, as well as the <a href="https://goo.gl/XZ9tnc" target="_blank">Participate Nevada County</a> crowdsourcing site that lets residents suggest new ideas for community improvement. Also of note is the county’s Collaborative Tech Center — supported by more than 20 local businesses, nonprofits and schools. The 2,000-square-foot addition to the county public library is dedicated to technology and community development, and promotes new technology use, job skills, collaboration and education.  <p>
 
Another highlight is the fact that Nevada County partnered with the community Public, Education and Government (PEG) cable TV station nonprofit operator, the Nevada County Digital Media Center (NCDMC) to assist them in avoiding a planned organizational shutdown. Using only the PEG franchise funds, the county purchased a new state-of-the-art video broadcast "station-in-a-box" technology platform and hosted it in the county data center, and helped NCDMC transition over to the new platform. This cloud solution allows NCDMC to operate at less cost, and the partnership was beneficial for the county in that it saved two highly regarded PEG TV channels and enabled the addition of a third educational channel for local schools.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Montgomery County has launched several regional technology initiatives designed to use resources more efficiently, and it’s upgrading online services to meet the needs of a more mobile citizenry. Separate ERP systems for the county government and Montgomery County Public Schools are being replaced by one consolidated platform. The move is eliminating duplication, improving accuracy and making data available to business users more quickly. The county also established a regional authority to consolidate 911 dispatch and emergency communication services for the Montgomery County Sheriff, Virginia Tech Police Department and several other local police forces. The authority is intended to strengthen interoperability and collaboration between local law enforcement agencies in the county. A <a href="http://www.montva.com" target="_blank">new county website</a> launched in April incorporates responsive design to better support mobile device users, and it includes new self-service features that let residents pay real estate and property taxes online.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Roanoke County is expanding citizen services, using data to improve public safety and strengthening enterprise IT governance. A new mobile-friendly <a href="http://www.roanokecountyva.gov/gis" target="_blank">GIS portal</a> gives citizens and county staff access to a large set of maps and applications. Users may create comprehensive maps or generate specific views for property taxes, government services, voter information, parks or school districts. In addition, a new Property Report function combines county real estate valuation data with aerial imagery, Google street maps, zoning data, tax maps and legal descriptions. The function, which enables citizens to generate custom real estate reports, has reduced citizen calls to the county Real Estate Valuation Office by almost 80 percent. An ongoing effort by county law enforcement to correlate crime and accident data has reduced violent crime by 6 percent in targeted areas, according to a January analysis. The technique uses data for burglaries, larcenies and crashes to direct police and community resources at hot spots. The county also formed a new Technology Governance Committee to address technology needs and set policies across its 35 separate business units.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> A commitment to transparency is evident in Skagit County, Wash. It offers an impressive amount of property data via searchable database by address, owner, road or parcel number. Even more depth on tax valuation, purchase and sale data, recorded documents, permits, and more is also available to site visitors, with information dating back to 1977. A location-based app getting more than 7,000 daily hits is another route to property data, providing everyone from real-estate agents to pizza delivery drivers more information than Google. The <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">CrimeMap app</a> features an interactive jail roster, court information and case details on reported crimes. Updated every 15 minutes, incident information from most county law enforcement agencies is included. The county’s approach to cybersecurity is risk-based, laid out in a security policy now under development. All information is classified based on sensitivity, reserving the costliest controls for protected data. Coupled with new event monitoring capabilities, firewall upgrades, encryption and other protections, the county has significantly reduced its vulnerability to viruses.<br>

<b>To Sum it Up:</b> Albemarle County, Va., launched a comprehensive citizen engagement effort, <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Budget Gateway</a>, to solicit public involvement in budget-related decision-making for both the county and local schools. The “virtual town hall in a box” included audio from division directors outlining budget realities, as well as video and social media tools aimed at getting and keeping residents engaged throughout the process. The county also continues to expand upon its Albemarle Performs <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">website</a>, which tracks KPIs for 11 different departments, with the help of interns from the University of Virginia. A recent redesign means the site is now mobile-aware. A coordinated effort to bring high-speed Internet to the county hinges in part on linking connectivity to its potential to advance agritourism and global sales of local farm products.

To meet the needs of the county attorney’s office for an easier way to distribute criminal discovery files (instead of mailing them), the IT team implemented Box.com. The new system provides access to prosecution and defense attorneys, and tracks who accesses the files. Other initiatives include the move to a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone system; providing an online widget for grant applicants to upload files with their application; and moving the county’s tax map from hand-drawn sheets to parcel fabric, which eliminates duplicate processes.<br>
