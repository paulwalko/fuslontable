Turned onto S Jackson Street from 2nd Avenue S. Was on the Amtrak overpass when vehicle cut in front of me. I swerved to prevent a collision when my front tire got wedged in the track and stopped my bike, sending me over the handlebars. I broke my elbow, requiring surgery and cracked my helmut down the middle. Luckily, I did not suffer a concussion. </a>

It was about two and a half years ago. I was biking down Jackson and turning left on a wet day, and didn't take the angle sharply enough, because my tire slipped on the track, and I went down, bloodying my elbow and tearing a hole in my jacket. It hurt, and it was annoying, but nothing serious. I don't understand why we have streetcars. My understanding is that they don't do anything that buses don't do, except they're less flexible, and they make things more dangerous. </a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Date and time are approximate; I don&#39;t remember the specifics. At the time, I regularly commuted to SLU via 4th Ave North -&gt; Westlake. I did my best to ride between the tracks and out of the way of traffic.

Occasionally a parked car or other obstruction caused me to cross over the tracks. On one such occasion, my tire was caught within the gap, my bike came to an immediate halt, and I was thrown forward over the handlebars. I struck my shoulder hard and sprained it.

Fortunately, there wasn&#39;t traffic directly behind me or I might also have ended up being struck by a car.</a>

There were no witnesses who saw my accident only a couple of people who saw the aftermath and called 911.  I woke up at Harborview with a serious concussion, broken elbow, sprained wrist, and badly swollen face (despite wearing a helmet).  I missed a week of work, was on reduced hours for another week after that, and had 2 months of physical therapy.  My memory is compromised now, I tend to forget things and sometimes get headaches.  </a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I was riding my bike on South Jackson St. approaching 5th Ave. South.  It was a dry, warm sunny day.  A Metro bus was stopped at the bus stop on the south side of South Jackson St.  I slowed, signaled I was moving into the left lane, and then pushed hard on the pedals to accelerate.  I crossed the streetcar tracks at approximately a 30 degree angle.  My rear wheel shot out from under me to my right and I crashed on my left side.  My wheel did not get stuck in the streetcar gap, but slid along the top.  It happened so fast my hands were still holding the handlebar grips.  I shattered my left collarbone into three big pieces and about 5 smaller pieces.  It was surgically repaired.   Streetcar tracks should have a rough surface to provide traction.

At the intersection with Terry I became unfamiliar with the bike infrastructure in the neighborhood. My plan was to pull over on to the sidewalk on the northwest corner of the intersection to check the map on my phone. I was aware of the tracks on Terry and attempted to cross at a 90 degree angle. However, rain had just started falling. The tracks were slippery. My front tire slipped on the tracks and got stuck in the tracks. My momentum took me north onto Terry and the only way to stop was to try to put my feet down. There was a construction barricade on Terry on the tracks that I ran in to and then fell. I had a few scrapes and a nice guy walking by helped me up. The rim on my front tire was bent and required replacement. I was lucky that there were no trains on the track due to the construction. I could have been more careful with my choice in where to pull over, but I still crossed the tracks at a 90 degree angle as recommended and the tracks failed me. The date and time are an approximation, but this was in June 2012. </a>

I've biked over streetcar tracks hundreds of times and had no problem, but that day, in the rain, in front of moving vehicles, my wheel slipped as I took a right turn. Fortunately, the car behind me missed hitting me as I slid in front of a parked car on the side of the road. My knee and hand took a couple of weeks to heal and I was able to realign my bike pretty easily, but I know I was lucky. I could have died or been chronically injured for the rest of my life because of those tracks.</a>

My front tire ended up parallel to the tracks and was caught in the flangeway.  I skidded out and the bike fell on one side with my son inside and I was pinned underneath.  I was able to get out from under and pull off to the side to recover.

I was very lucky that there were no passing cars or trains, that the box protected my son and the heaviest parts of the bike didn't land on me.  There was some minor damage to the bike (it bent some of the pegs on the box for attaching the canopy) and I was pretty scraped up and sore.  Again I was very lucky.

I never bike on streets that have streetcar lines.  I choose routes where I don't have to bike across them.  Streetcar lines are extremely dangerous for cyclists and effectively kick them off the street.  They are not part of any safe or complete streets solution without significant safety improvements for cyclists.</a>

Hello SDOT, 

Last night I was biking home south on broadway.  The road is marked with sharrows about .1 miles before the spot when the trolly tracks crossed the road at a very slight angle.  My front wheel became caught in the track and caused me to flip over my handle bars at ~15-20 mph because it was  downhill.  I’m still assessing my injuries, but of the five people that saw me crash two of them said they’d done the same thing.

Seattle DOT needs to fix this.  When is Seattle DOT going to make streets safe for bicyclists?  You CANNOT put a sharrow on the road and then lead the bicyclist straight into a life threatening situation.  I could have easily been flipped right in front of a moving car or bus and been killed.  Which ever city planner/designer came up with the design and execution really needs to revisit their decision and plan for bikes to be encouraged on Broadway.  

Here is the spot where the incident occurred.  

https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6174535,-122.3208357,3a,90y,345.98h,56.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGIVhHf0VO0WTq1Arx_2AeA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en-US

And yes, I’m cc’ing two Seattle Bike advocacy groups because I know bikers in Seattle have complained about these situations in the past and yet they are still prevalent in the city in several spots.  Sadly and frustratingly I’m wondering if someone does need to die before Seattle takes action – though I’m grateful it wasn’t me last night.  My bike is also trashed – and will probably need $500 to fix it (thanks SDOT).  

Any of you on this e-mail are free to contact me if you have any questions – I definitely want to see the situation fixed.  

Thanks,

Michael Diederich

There are many options to avoid the dangers that rail tracks represent. you can get off your bike, take a different street, change the angle you cross the tracks, use wider tires...
Rail tracks are not the only obstacle in the street facing bicycle riders.  Man hole covers, pot holes, cars, construction zones, and any other number of dangers exist. It seems irresponsible of the Seattle Times to focus on this one issue. 
In the past two month, I personally know of three people who have crashed their bike crossing a steel plate in a construction area along Alaskan Way.  If you are going to cover the topic of dangers for cyclists, please do so holistically.   </a>

Once I hit the tracks at 90 degrees, the bike flew out from under me and I fell hard. this left me with bruising to my knee, ankle, hip, and shoulder, and I cracked two ribs on my left side. Hardly my worst crash, but it left me hurting... After the crash I learned that the tracks were damp due to the previous night's rain (even though the street had been dry), and that if the crossing is taken with ANY speed, following the lined curve leaves you in a slight lean as you cross the tracks and the momentum of the rider pushes into the curve rather than straight ahead. I was probably only going 5-10 MPH as I crossed. I still ride this route almost daily, even in the rain, and now never follow the bike lane as it curves to meet the track.</a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">While riding North on Westlake, I was in between the streetcar tracks. Knowing that the tracks aren't safe, I moved to change lanes and turn left so I could take Dexter the rest of the way home. Both my tires dropped into the gap and I crashed. I got road rash on my face and sprained my foot! :( I filed a complaint with the city, since streetcar tracks on the right side of the road are considered by experts to not be a good idea for exactly this reason, but the response I got was that I wasn't supposed to be riding along Westlake anyway. </a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">my own stupidity. no cars or streetcars were around but I quickly realized that westlake would not be the most friendly bike route home (typical route dexter &gt; mercer &gt; eastlake) While trying to switch from the far right of the right lane, across the tracks, i didn&#39;t not get my tire perpendicular-enough and got my front tire caught in the track.

took a pretty bad spill for a one-bike accident. broke my helmet and got some pretty good road rash. bike chain came apart but thankfully was not damaged.</a>

I must have stopped the turn too soon because, while my front tire cleared the tacks, my rear tire fell into the "gully".  I lost my balance and went down on my right side with most of the impact to my upper arm/shoulder.  I was happy to have had a helmet on as my head riccoched off the pavement a few times before I came to a stop.  I had a few moments to get up, assess the damage and even make 2 trips to get my bike and my gear out of the road before the light changed and oncoming traffic commenced.  I went to my doctor's office later that day when I found the pain in my shoulder to be getting worse.  There was no break, but I had to wear an arm sling for several weeks and have some physical therapy because I had some limited arm movement for some time afterward.</a>

I need to find a different route! Unfortunately it's the most direct route between downtown and the uW,</a>

I was pissed more than anything other than the temporary pain. cursing and swearing at that f***ing track!! I later was applying bandages in the restroom when a guy told me his friend was killed earlier this year when her bike stopped immediately without time for her to react.

Luckily I always wear a helmet because I hit head first and it is AMAZING how much it still hurts to hit your head that hard when you are wearing a helmet.

On the Burke Gilman Trail behind Hales Brewery I saw a young mother with her toddler in a bike seat on the back of the bike go down on the railroad tracks last summer. The mother was clearly an inexperienced rider and was not wearing a helmet but the child was. The child came all the way out of the seat and was thrown onto the pavement and scraped up knees and elbows. The mother hit her head and was extremely disoriented. SUPER SCARY.</a>

It not only caused about $200 worth of damage to my bike but also injured me slightly. A car thankfully was driving a safe distance behind me and was able to stop before hitting me. I stopped biking to work after that incident and took to bus instead. I have not biked downtown ever since.</a>

I had avoided taking the designated bike path area on Broadway due to the amount of pedestrians crossing the street - making the turn difficult so it was easier to just turn and head south on Broadway. </a>

Two of my close friends got stuck in the flangeway gap and broke their collarbones within a week of each other in 2015 on Yesler and 14th Ave. I am very strongly pro-transit, pro-density, and pro-growth. However, I hate the streetcars with a passion! Trolley buses provide enhanced public benefit at 1/10th the price point and likely many fewer deaths and serious injuries to cyclists. My commute takes me past no less than 3 "ghost bikes." </a>

Now that there are more people on bikes, people are finally getting it. Bloodied and bruised I decided to go home that day instead of work. I've also been sitting at a cafe across from Whole Foods on Westlake when a woman took a tumble just like mine. She was stunned, completely in shock, and we sat with her until she could gather enough composure to call a friend. Apparently the staff at La Toscanella see lots.</a>

Cyclists have sharrows on Broadway going southbound, but then the sharrows abruptly stop at E Howell.  The new two way bike lane begins on the east side of Broadway, south of the intersection.

So there is a basically a break in the chain of bike safety, and no warning signs about the new streetcar track that curves out at the perfect angle to snag one's tire.  No indication that one needs to get off the street and walk one's bike to the next cross walk, then use the new two-way bike lane.  I continued riding straight south on Broadway and directly into the curving track.  

I remember seeing the track and comprehending briefly the coming slam.  I went down fast, probably riding 15-20 mph, over my handlebars and onto my shoulder and knee and helmet.  A pedestrian across the street yelled to see if I was ok, but the adrenaline from the slam was enough to jolt me into quickly picking up my bike and moving across the street to the new bike lane.  I rode home to Beacon Hill, bleeding and in pain, on a misaligned front wheel, and ended up having to get new handlebars and a new front wheel, as the bars had bent to nearly the point of breaking, and my front wheel had bent as well.  

I know this must be an very common place to crash and is incredibly dangerous, I'm surprised we haven't had any fatalities here.  It would be easy for someone to break their neck, bash their head on the track or the curb, or be riding in moderate traffic and crash and be run over by a car traveling south behind the cyclist.

Thank you Seattle Times for the opportunity to pinpoint this dangerous track.

I chose a route of Mercer east to Westlake south up to Denny. 

Being that there is a fair amount of traffic there, I tried to keep my speed up &amp; went wide left in the right lane to make the right turn to Westlake. I found myself turning right into the tracks &amp; to avoid crashing, I had to cross them at an angle which sent me across the left lane into oncoming traffic. 

I didn&#39;t crash but the tracks definitely caused me to get wildly out of control. There&#39;s signage there but the time of night &amp; the speed I needed to travel to stay w/ the flow made me miss it.  </a>

There was a bus on the right lane which had stopped to pick up passengers along the route.  I decided to try bypassing the bus on the left side since I didn't want to have to stop and go everytime the bus had to pick up a passenger.  When I was passing the bus, I stayed on the right side of the streetcar tracks and inside the left lane, however the bus begins to pull out and move leftwards which caused me to react by pulling over further to the left.  My front tire gets caught in the streetcar track and i fall over.  I ended up damaging my bike and injuring my left shoulder.</a>

This time I only had cuts on my legs and jammed my shoulders. A few physical therapy sessions later and I was okay. </a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I was riding to work at Fred Hutch, where I'd worked and commuted for 4 years. At the very end of my commute I turn left off Fairview Ave N, and cross the tracks at the terminus of the SLUT streetcar. I've crossed those tracks hundreds of times. That morning I crossed the tracks at a 90-degree angle, as always, but as I was looking up at oncoming traffic as I was turning, I forget about the other set of tracks that split off from the ones I'd already crossed. I caught my front wheel in the tracks and went over hard on my left side. I had a concussion and a huge bruise on my hip for a few days.

Most importantly for this survey: The nurse on campus who examined me after the accident asked where the accident had happened. When I told her it was crossing the tracks at the trolley terminus, she said: "Yep, we get a lot of cyclists who crash right there." I never reported the accident so add me to the unreported list.

I get that a lot of the fixes involve expensive work to streets. But how about a very low-cost interim solution? Paint intersections where cyclists cross tracks some bright color. That is definitely not the case at the Fairview terminus, and we have a lot of people cycling across those tracks every single workday.</a>

I ended up having to cross the streetcar tracks.  I did so at an angle like I always do on train tracks.  My front wheel got caught.  I was able to pop that out but then the rear got caught.  I stopped abruptly and fell over sideways bending my rim and going down on my hands.  Minor injuries but I did have to replace the rim because it was too bent.  Now I am very concerned when I have to ride near or over these tracks.  They are worse then train tracks and seem a lot more slippery and prone to catching tires.</a>

I had pretty bad roadrash for a couple weeks and have had physical therapy for my shoulder. I ended up completing the STP but my conditioning was definitely set back several weeks.</a>

As I was biking with traffic I noticed the metal rails and thought, foolishly, it would be best to ride between the rightmost flangeway gap and the right-side curb. The curb narrowed to the point where it was no longer tenable and I would have to cross to at least be in between the tracks. Since I did not have a natural stop and had never tried this before, I attempted to cross the flangeway gap. My tire caught and I flipped off the bike and rolled a couple times on the road. I suffered a scrape on my elbow, some pain in my shoulder that went away, and some pain in my lower back that has persisted for a year in spite of various efforts to treat it through massage, yoga, and acupuncture. My bike was fortunately okay and ultimately I was not as injured as I could have been.</a>

My tires slipped and I nearly went down. This was a nice day - not wet.  But this transition is super sketchy.  To cross these tracks at a 90 degree angle, you have to essentially ride right into oncoming traffic.  It's only a matter of time before a serious crash occurs here.  If it's during heavy traffic, it could well be fatal.</a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">I was on my route on Jackson toward Pioneer Square. I saw that the bus going in front of me was going to make a stop at the designated bus stop on the corner of 8th, just below I-5.
So, as I usually did in this situation, I proceeded to do my passing maneuver by slowing down, checking behind me to make sure it was clear, and cross to the left lane over the street tracks. I don't remember anything else after this, and I'm not sure if my front tire got inside the track, or slid, or a combination of both, because that's the point where another set of tracks coming from 8th join the ones on Jackson. The wheel of my bike got minor scuffs and slightly off true, but not bent. The bike shop guy could not deliberate for sure what could've happened.
As for me, my helmet hit the ground and got a small crack. With the impact, the helmet hit my sunglasses which in turn scuffed my right cheekbone. But unfortunately that was minor in comparison to the concussion it caused, which lasted about 6-7 hours or a bit more (not sure when a concussion officially stops being one), but I was a good day or two resting and sleeping a lot, and I took almost two weeks off work. 
I've never had a concussion before, and it is a scary thing, not only for the physical injury but because to this day there are many events around the accident that I don't remember at all, even though I was supposedly conscious in parts of it. Apparently, I actually walked from the accident to the sidewalk to call my brother to come help me. He came to pick me up and saw something was amiss so he took me to the hospital. He left me in the reception area while he looked for parking, and apparently I also checked myself in and gave all my personal info to the receptionist. Next thing my brother comes to meet me and I'm already in a gurney unconscious. They ran some tests and CT scans, and I was let go within a couple hours since there was no brain damage and I had no insurance.
I do remember repeating stuff over a few times, but my brother tells me that it might be by the time I was regaining consciousness because he says I repeated stuff over and over and over incessantly. He was seriously scared for me, but the people in the hospital told him it was very normal in this kind of injury. I also remember feeling my brain bouncing around inside my skull for a few weeks at least, like a bucket of water. It was quite the shock.
I've always been a careful cycler over tracks, as I know a few people who've had accidents in them before, no concussions for them fortunately but really badly scraped and bodily injured. But now after my own accident, I'm even more careful and even go out of my way to avoid tracks if I can. Unfortunately, Yesler has been on and off construction for over a year now, and there's no other alternate route that connects east-west except for Jackson.
And unfortunately, also, Jackson has proved to be a poorly executed project, and which is in urgent need of a revision: buses have stops on the right but the street car stops are on the left. Also lanes appear and disappear, and the widths are not consistent, so everyone is all over the place trying to manage a way through. For bikes sometimes there's a sharrow and sometimes a dedicated lane. It's well known that bicycles and tracks don't go well together (hence the title of this article and the request for the input from cyclists), but even car drivers hate tracks because they frequently pass very close to you since they want to avoid the street tracks, too! And they're zigzagging in and out to avoid the stopped buses on the right and the street car on the left.
I really don't know how this project got approved. It does not improve anyone's choice of transportation, not even pedestrians. And I don't even want to get started on the Westlake tracks... I wasn't a fan of street cars before, and after my accident, I'm now a fervent opponent. Maybe not street cars per se, but their wheel technology that needs tracks. Pneumatics were invented over a hundred years ago! There's no romanticism in the nostalgia of street cars at the expense of unnecessary accidents, injuries, and loss of lives.
I hope this recount, ramble, and rant helps with the information you're seeking.
Cheers!</a>

We were going back home at around 6 PM and we chose to go down Westlake Avenue North. The tracks at the intersection of John and Westlake start to curve east on John.and as my bike front tire tried to pass over the curved tracks, the tire got stuck in the gap and threw me off my bike. I hit my head really hard and my eyes could only see in bright green. I had knee and hand scratches plus some minor bleeding. I have never falling off my bike since I started biking in Seattle in 2005. I did that day and it was very painful. Whoever says the tracks aren't dangerous, they do not know. I am lucky there were no cars passing along Westlake next to me or else my entire body would have been ran over by a car and possibly killed. I had to walk my bike with my partner for a few blocks until my sight came back.</a>

I tumbled over the front of the bike and landed hard on my left wrist.

The barista from Jucivana (coffee shop on that corner) leaned out the window to see if I was ok. She commented that she'd already seen other cyclists crash in that same spot. The tracks were new at the time and I wasn't used to navigating across them. Learned my lesson and I feel fortunate to have paid a much smaller price than others.

<b>Description:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">As a regular rider on the route, I was WELL aware of the potential for danger with the tracks. I was riding West down a pretty empty S Jackson St at 6:45am in the bike “lane” with the tracks a lane or two over on my left. As I was taking a left onto 5th to make my way to the International District Station, even at an angle my tire slipped on the track and got pulled into the gap. A broken wrist, 5 face stitches and lots of reflection later I think once I begin riding again, my only move in the future will be to exit the road at 5th and cross Jackson in the crosswalk, completely perpendicular to the tracks.</a>

I attempted to crossover the flangeway gap at a direct angle (90 degrees); however, my front tire began to wedge into the gap. This unexpected change in direction caused me to lose my balance, and I fell over sideways off of my bike. I sustained some bruising along the side of my body that impacted the road surface. Additionally, I tore major portions of my skin over my knuckles. I was shock up, but I was able to get on my bike without assistance and continue my commute.</a>

After crossing 12th on my way downtown, I slowly went around the bus traffic at the stop on Jackson and ended up in the middle of the tracks.  When I went to return to the right hand lane, my rear tire stuck in the tracks and I went over the handlebars.  Unhurt besides a few bruised ribs and a little road rash, I got up and loaded my bike on to one of the buses as I had bent a wheel and could no longer ride.  As someone who doesn't and will likely never ride the streetcar, I'm sad this has been my only interaction with the project.  </a>

My front tire ended up parallel to the tracks and was caught in the flangeway.  I skidded out and the bike fell on one side with my son inside and I was pinned underneath.  I was able to get out from under and pull off to the side to recover.

I was very lucky that there were no passing cars or trains, that the box protected my son and the heaviest parts of the bike didn't land on me.  There was some minor damage to the bike (it bent some of the pegs on the box for attaching the canopy) and I was pretty scraped up and sore.  Again I was very lucky.

I never bike on streets that have streetcar lines.  I choose routes where I don't have to bike across them.  Streetcar lines are extremely dangerous for cyclists and effectively kick them off the street.  They are not part of any safe or complete streets solution without significant safety improvements for cyclists.</a>

Since it was dark and raining, I didn't realize how close I was to the track. My back wheel got caught in the track and I went down into the other lane of traffic. An oncoming driver stopped in time, but laid on their horn (I think they thought I tried to turn in front of them and bailed at the last minute). I feel very lucky to have walked away unscathed, but my back rim was bent about 30 degrees. When I went into work and told my coworkers, a few had similar experiences. One even broke her collarbone after hitting the tracks on westlake</a>

Then all of a sudden something happened that I couldn't believe; the tracks for the SLUT suddenly up and jumped into my path and I nearly lost control and fell off the bike.  I've never seen anything like this before, the tracks moved all by themselves and got in the way of my moving bike.

This is a safety issue when tracks all of a sudden move and obstruct the path a a bicyclist. What are those tracks doing in downtown anyways. I've never seen anybody on the SLUT trying to use this idiotic means for mass transit.  However, I've seen up to 3 bike riders a day as I go and have lunch in downtown on weekdays.  If we feel the needs of these elitist who want to have a motorized vehicle able to transport a bunch of people in a single transport vehicle is better use of the west lake during lunch as opposed to the safety of bicyclists who have the God given right to be able to ride our individual transport mechanism without the risk of these tracks that increasingly have a mind of their own jumping in my path, then we are in a sad state and Seattle better be careful that we will chase away the quality of life we deserve in our downtown corridor.  

As a bicyclist who enjoys listening to music as I ride, I have a right to not need to worry about anything other than my own thoughts.  These damn tracks need to remain in place and not be permitted to place me at risk and burdened with constantly looking out to see if they move on their own.  While we are at it, those cars are constantly moving and when they change lanes I front of me i nearly hit them every time as I approach.  Just because they signal and I see the signal means I should go out of my way to also be accountable. I'm telling you I would rather be right and hospitalized than wrong and at home with my family at the end of the day.

Obviously this response is sarcastic and never be taken seriously by the huge contingent of bicyclist throughout our city who I see throughout downtown daily (again sarcasm, never more than a handful). In addition I've seen many more near accidents with pedestrians being struck by bicyclist as opposed to vehicles and bikes or tracks and bike riders.

How about a survey of pedestrians and bike risks? Didn't think so.  From my u dear standing pedestrians far outnumber bikes in our downtown corridor.</a>

I jerked forward and fell to the left. My bike frame rammed right into my knee and upper shin as I fell to the road. I was in so much pain and couldn't move my left leg, I was lucky a man at a bus stop nearby helped move me off the street before traffic came. I went to the ER soon after for X-rays and am lucky to have sustained only a really gnarly bruise. I couldn't stand for several days however, which really affected me at work as a barista. I had to take time off without any sick pay, I was lucky to find an office job soon after that. Otherwise I'm not sure what I would've done without being able to let my leg heal, I actually still can't feel much of my left shin now.</a>

I hadn't ridden my bike in Seattle very often, but I decided to bike to my client's office in downtown Seattle that morning. I was coming from the U-District. I made it to Capital Hill fine. Somewhere along Broadway the bike lane on the right side of the road switches to the left side when you're heading south. I didn't notice this. When I slightly changed the trajectory of my front tire, it slipped into the metal surface of the bus tracks. This changed the trajectory of my body, which catapulted over the steering wheels. I was fine, although a little rattled. Pedestrians laughed. I'm thankful the driver 5 feet behind me wasn't too busy laughing to hit the brakes of his car. 

Later that day, after work, I walked to the park near my client's office where I locked my bike. It wasn't there. Somebody stole it. Yes, I was pretty disappointed, but I figured at least I wouldn't have to bike home and potentially crash and burn again that day.</a>

<b>Description:</b> <a href="This%20was%20on%20my%20motorcycle%20(still%20technically%20a" target="_blank">This was on my motorcycle (still technically a "bike").  I was heading west on E Yesler Way going downhill.  It was raining and the lower stretch of that hill has a 10%-15% grade (according to google maps).  It's not the steepest hill in Seattle but the grade matters a lot when a wet track is involved.  I have been riding a motorcycle since I was 16.  I pride myself on being a confident, safe, and experienced rider.  This was literally the first time I'd ever gone down.  

When crossing tracks on a bike (motorcycle or bicycle), the current literature says to aim for at least a 45 degree "attack angle" when crossing tracks (90 degrees being ideal).  The intention is to make your momentum vector as close to being perpendicular to the tracks as possible so that if a tire catches or slips, your momentum will keep you going across the track quickly enough to recover.

This 45 degree attack angle is impossible on this, and many, streetcar roads.  Making things worse is the fact that it is on a hill and is fairly wet most of the year.  In my case, I was trying to get to the other side of the track when my tire got caught in the groove for just a fraction of a second.  This means my momentum was at some angle to the track when my front wheel was forced to move parallel to the track.  When the wheel came out of the groove, I was off balance.  Then the front wheel continued to slip along the track while I was trying to recover.  The wheel just seem to go right out from under me and the bike and I went down.  The funny thing was this was at an incredibly low speed as the light at Boren was red.  I was very lucky because it could have been much worse but I did hurt my knee pretty badly.  I landed knee first and then my foot was pinned while the weight of the bike pushed my body away from my leg.  It definitely hurt and my leg was like jello but I was in shock enough to get right up without feeling the damage.  I still managed to lift the bike and ride home but my knee has never been the same.  I have a complete ACL tear that will require surgery to correct.  

If this can happen on the larger tires of a motorcycle, bicycles would be even more vulnerable.  </a>

Yesler Way in front of Bailey-Gatzert School. The bike lane is on the south side of the Broadway Streetcar tracks and as I crossed the tracks and started to curve around the bend my back tire caught in the flangeway gap and I went down hard. No broken bones, but lots of road rash. My front wheel was slightly bent, but only because I have a cross bike and so the wheel is heavier-duty than my road bike. If it had been my road bike, it would have bent the wheel beyond rideability. Subsequently, when making that turn I consciously cross the tracks at a 90 degree angle in the left turn lane on 12th before turning right on the bike path.</a>

I was riding westwards to head down to Chef Sealth High School to volunteer for Cascade Bike Club. I made a left turn from the right lane. I cleared the nearest track but the 2nd track caught me. I fell over my bike. Ripped my favorite jacket. Banged up my knees. Got a concussion and a scar on my face. I was wearing a helmet.

The bike was okay.</a>

My route took me from 19th Ave E in Cap Hill, down Pine, up 8th to Westlake. I crossed over the South Lake Union streetcar tracks too slowly; my wheel got caught in the groove and I lost control. I flipped over my handlebars into the middle of Westlake. Luckily no cars were immediately behind me. I hobbled over to Whole Foods, cleaned up a bit, and finished my commute on the bus.

My knee was quite injured and it was difficult to walk or bend it for a couple of weeks, but other than that I escaped largely unscathed. I eventually got back on my bike and went to ride again, until about a year later when a car hit me on Dexter (June 2015). Again, I was somehow largely unhurt, but I know better than to try my luck a third time -- I haven't ridden a bike in Seattle since then</a>

Instead, I headed across the intersection at Denny, aiming for the curb ramp to wait with pedestrians to cross in the crosswalk with the light. By aiming for the ramp, my bike wheels slipped into the gap and I hit the ground in the middle of the intersection before I knew what happened. Luckily for me no injuries to me or my bike other than a few scrapes. </a>

I always bike in the left lane, where there are no tracks, but an ambulance was approaching me from behind as I was passing through the intersection at Westlake and Denny, and I swerved to the right to make space for the ambulance.  I made it over the first set of tracks, and was trying to come to rest between the tracks, but slipped on the metal and fell into the flangeway gap.  I panicked and slammed on my brakes and fell out of the road and into the bushes.  I was mostly fine -- minor scrapes and bruises -- because I fell into a bush, but it was really terrifying.</a>

Jackson St. from 2nd Ave. when my tire slipped into the flangeway. I probably could have avoided this if I went parallel against the tracks but I was on the inside lane and the tracks came into my lane causing me to slip into the track easily. It would be nice if the bike markers told me to get over so that I could have had a better angle and make it safely into the right lane. </a>

So I decided to try a different route, going down Blanchard to Westlake to South Lake Union. If I remember right, at the time Westlake was marked on Google Maps as a sharrow street. I don't think I would have tried it otherwise. I was unaware of the streetcar tracks, and the warning sign for cyclists at the intersection (which I found while investigating the intersection later) was at the top of a pole several feet above my head and out of my field of view. I saw the tracks ahead as I came through the intersection, but with a car on my left, I had no escape route and had to try to cross them. My front tire dropped into the tracks, and I went over the handle bars. I fractured my cheekbone and chin, busted the knuckles on both my hands so badly my hands were swollen for days, and had road burn across most of the right side of my face, on my right arm, and my right leg. My knees, right hip, right side of my rib cage, and both my hands were black and blue. There was a split second of pain when I landed face-first, and then the whole right side of my head immediately went numb, as if that half of my head had disappeared. It was so disorienting, people had to come out into the street and half carry me to the sidewalk because I couldn't tell what direction was up. A bystander called 911, but I (probably stupidly) insisted I didn't need the paramedics, because I didn't have health insurance and was afraid of ambulance or emergency room charges. (I was working full time, but we were in the middle of prolonged union negotiations, and benefits had been delayed by several months.) The operator asked the bystander to ask me if I had lost consciousness, and when I answered I didn't think so, the operator seemed to agree paramedics weren't necessary and no one was sent to check me. Even more stupidly, I waited a half hour till I stopped shaking, went into Whole Foods and asked for a first aid kit, dug the gravel out of my cheek in the bathroom, and got back on my bike and rode the 6 miles home. I realize now I probably had a concussion, but because I'm low income, I was more afraid that if I didn't get back on my bike right then, I never would, and biking was too essential to my budget and the graveyard hours I worked. Because I didn't have health insurance, I didn't seek out medical attention, so I'm not sure precisely how severe the fracture in my cheek and chin were, but I had bumps where the bone was knitting for six months. After hearing other stories about broken bones, injuries requiring multiple surgeries, and fatalities, I feel like I got away light. And it still took months to heal.</a>

Each time has been close to or around Denny &amp; Westlake (Wholefoods) and was in prime traffic times. 

The first time I was completely flung from my bike and though my leg was very badly scratched up, I was able to rebound from the fall and pull my bike up prior to getting hit by a car. I&#39;ve seen numerous other bike accidents at this very intersection and am guessing this is a VERY popular interception for accidents</a>
