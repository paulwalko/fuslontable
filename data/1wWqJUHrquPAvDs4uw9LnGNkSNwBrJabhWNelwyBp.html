<b>quote:</b> “I worry about the public schools, about all the bureaucracy that comes with public schools,” she said. <br>
<b>name:</b> Bevin Walsh is the mother of a two-year-old who is “so far away from all this stuff” and yet has already started thinking about where her child will attend kindergarten. 
<br><br>
Walsh has heard great things about P.S. 199 from her neighbors, who she said moved to their apartment building for the school. 
<br><br>
Though she harbors concerns about public school, P.S. 199 might convince her to stay in the system. 
<br><br>
“I hear great things. I would not be disappointed if she want to P.S. 199,” Walsh said.  <br>

<b>name:</b> Shanell Simpkins has two sons that attend a Success Academy charter school on the Upper West Side. She originally enrolled her younger son in P.S. 191, but pulled him out because he didn't have homework for a month, she said.<br><br>
“I don’t want my kids there,” Simpkins said. “All I want is for my children to have a real chance in life and have the tools they need to be successful.” <br>

<b>quote:</b> “It’s nonsense,” Vardi said about the rezoning. “What they are doing now is putting a bandaid [on 191]. 191 is still going to be a bad school.” <br>
<b>name:</b> Vardi has a student in second grade at P.S. 199. Moving zoning lines around isn’t going to do enough to improve P.S. 191, he said, and he considers a 191-199 super zone a golden opportunity. 
<br><br>
“I’m all for it,” he said. “They need to be mixed. They must be mixed."<br>

<b>name:</b> Ryan Wortman, who just started kindergarten, is on the waiting list for P.S. 199 and currently goes to school at P.S. 452. Ryan’s nanny, Sophia Delatorre, said that Ryan is happy attending P.S. 452 and she hopes he gets off the waitlist at P.S. 199, but she has her reservations about him attending P.S. 191.<br> 
<br>
“No, I think it’s not good. Somebody told me the same. Everybody says the same,” Delatorre said. “I’m the nanny but I hear everything.”<br>

<b>description:</b> Lauren and Charlie Pollak <br>
<b>quote:</b> “It’s unclear to me why it’s being dismissed as this stepchild option,” said Lauren Pollak about creating a super zone between P.S. 191 and P.S. 199.  “My strong preference is to send them to public school. I don’t believe in private school for the same reason I believe in the super zone.” <br>
<b>name:</b> Lauren and Charlie Pollak are deeply concerned about how the rezoning will impact their son, who starts kindergarten next fall. They moved to their apartment specifically so he could attend P.S. 199. Now, they've learned that under the rezoning proposal, their zone will shift.  
<br><br>
“It’s obviously something we feel very strongly about,” Lauren Pollak said. 
<br><br>
The Pollaks are extremely supportive of a super zone. Their son currently goes to P.S. 191 for pre-K, which they said is a common choice in their building. They are very pleased with their son’s pre-K.<br>

<b>quote:</b> “It’s so-so,” Carrasquillo said about P.S. 191. “Last year it was bad. This year it’s OK.” <br>
<b>name:</b> Eric Carrasquillo is the parent of three children who go to P.S. 191: a seventh grader, a third grader, and a second grader. The difference between last year and this year, Carrasquillo said is the removal of a group of “bad kids.” <br><br>
Carrasquillo said he knows little about the surrounding schools.  <br><br>
“I’m new. I don’t know the area,” but he said, “It sounds like a good idea.”<br>

<b>quote:</b> “It’s a very different makeup there,” she said about P.S. 191. “I’m all for integration and blending but it would have to be done in a very transitional manner.”<br>
<b>name:</b> Cathy Latorre-Weiner said her daughter, who is going into kindergarten next year, will have “just got in by a hair" if the area is rezoned according to the initial plan.
<br><br>
As the rezoning process began, Latorre-Weiner said she had looked into private school for her daughter. If her daughter was zoned for P.S. 191, Latorre-Weiner, who is currently a stay-at-home mother, said she would go back to work to afford private school. 
<br><br>
“I think there’s such a disparity in the district that could have some important ramifications,” she said.<br>
