<b>Facility Name:</b> Asheville Steam Electric Power Plant<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 200 CP&amp;L Drive, Arden, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> The two-unit 376-megawatt coal-fired Asheville Plant is located in Skyland, N.C. The site also includes two combustion turbines capable of producing 324 megawatts. The Asheville Plant is the largest electric generating facility in Western North Carolina, and began commercial operation in 1964, with additions in 1971, 1999 and 2000.

<b>Facility Name:</b> Belews Creek Steam Station<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 3195 Pine Hall Road, Belews Creek, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> Belews Creek Steam Station is a two-unit coal-fired generating facility located on Belews Lake in Stokes County, N.C. It is one of Duke Energy’s largest coal-burning power plants in the Carolinas and consistently ranks among the most efficient coal facilities in the United States. Cooling water for Belews Creek Steam Station is provided by Belews Lake, a man-made lake formed when Duke Power built the facility.

Duke Energy has made significant improvements to reduce emissions from the company’s coal-fired plants. Both of the Belews Creek generating units are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 80 percent and flue gas desulfurization equipment (scrubbers) to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately 95 percent.

<b>Facility Name:</b> Buck Steam Station<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 1555 Dukeville Road, Salisbury, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> Buck Steam Station is a four-unit coal-fired generating station located on the Yadkin River in Rowan County, N.C. It was Duke Energy’s first large capacity coal generating plant built in the Carolinas and was named for the company’s co-founder James Buchanan "Buck" Duke.

Units 3 and 4, 113 megawatts combined, were retired in mid-2011, and units 5 and 6, 143 megawatts combined, were retired in April 2013. Unit 4 was originally ordered and built for a navy vessel during World War II. When the Pentagon canceled the order, the manufacturer offered the unit to Duke Power, a forerunner of Duke Energy. Three combustion turbine units were retired in October 2012. 

The site also is the home of the new Buck Combined Cycle Plant, a 620-megawatt natural gas facility that generates electricity very efficiently while reducing air emissions. The plant came online in late 2011.

<b>Facility Name:</b> Cliffside Steam Station<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 573 Duke Power Road, Cliffside, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> Construction for Cliffside’s first unit took a year and a half to complete. That was back in 1939, when power sales in the area had increased 60 percent in five years. Construction of the plant influenced the town’s framework as families moved into the area to build and manage the plant. That first 38-MW unit, along with units 2, 3 and 4 – a total of 198 MW – were retired on October 1, 2011. More info: https://www.duke-energy.com/power-plants/coal-fired/cliffside.asp

<b>Facility Name:</b> Dan River Steam Station<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 864 South Edgewood Road, Eden, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> In 1948, construction on what was then a cutting-edge coal unit in Rockingham County, N.C. commenced. Units 1 and 2 came online in 1949 and 1950, respectively. And by 1955, a third unit was added. All in all, $31 million was spent for the station’s net capacity of 276 megawatts (MW).

However, by 2008 the technology had quickly surpassed the three units that comprised the station. Duke Energy announced plans to retire the station’s three units, along with three natural gas combustion turbines that had been in operation since 1968.

When the three units were retired on April 1, 2012, the company was already in the midst of replacing the outdated technology. A few hundred yards away, a new natural gas facility was near completion.

The final months of 2012 saw the retirement of the smaller gas units in October and commercial operation of Dan River Combined-Cycle Station in December. The new 620-MW station is cleaner and more efficient, serving up to 620,000 customers – nearly double the capacity of the retired steam station.

<b>Facility Name:</b> Lee Steam Electric Plant<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> 1677 Old Smithfield Road, Goldsboro, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> After serving Wayne County customers for more than 60 years, the H.F. Lee Plant was retired on Sept. 15, 2012. As part of Duke Energy’s commitment to a cleaner, more efficient energy future, three coal-fired units were retired in September 2012 followed by four oil-fueled combustion turbine units in October 2012.

Originally known as the Goldsboro Plant, operation began shortly after the end of World War II, when the electric industry was prospering while electric prices were dropping. Customer demand helped necessitate additional pulverized-coal units in 1952 and 1962, and four oil-fueled combustion turbine units between 1967 and 1971.

In March 1964, the plant was renamed after Harry Fitzhugh Lee, a district manager who retired from Carolina Power &amp; Light after a 45-year career. Lee’s family was well known; he was a great-grandson of Revolutionary War officer Henry &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee III, and a grand-nephew of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. However, H.F. Lee’s name, associates said, was synonymous with electric service in Wayne County.

When the retirement was announced in 2009, the company also announced plans to construct a gas-fired combined cycle plant. The 920-MW station began operation in December 2012.

<b>Facility Name:</b> Marshall Steam Station<br>
<b>Street Address:</b> Lake Norman of Catawba, NC<br>
<b>Duke Energy Notes:</b> Marshall Steam Station is a four-unit, coal-fired generating facility located in Catawba County, N.C. Named for former Duke Power president E.C. Marshall, the station is located on Lake Norman.

One of the largest coal facilities owned by Duke Energy in the Carolinas, Marshall generates enough electricity to power approximately 2 million homes. Since it began commercial operation in 1965, Marshall Steam Station has been among the most efficient power plants in the nation.

Duke Energy has made significant improvements to reduce emissions from the company’s coal-fired plants. A unique type of burner arrangement in the boilers keeps the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Marshall facility well below regulatory limits.

In 2004, the company began installing flue gas desulfurization equipment – commonly known as scrubbers. This equipment will lower the station’s sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately 95 percent. The project was completed in 2007.
