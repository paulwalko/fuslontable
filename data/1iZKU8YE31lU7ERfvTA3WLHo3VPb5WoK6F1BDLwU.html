<b>Brief description :</b> The project aims at the socio-economic recovery by supporting small and medium businesses to scale up job creation activities. It also provides assistance to socially excluded groups and individuals in the area with a special focus on refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) who, upon return, face difficulties in accessing basic infrastructure, community and social services, as well as employment or income generation activities. Central Croatian regions of Banovina and Kordun regions are still struggling to recover after the 1991-1995 conflict. Despite its increased vicinity to the capital Zagreb thanks to recent and ongoing infrastructure works, the counties rank very low in terms of social services, health and education. Return of refugees and influx of refugees from Bosnia has been larger here than in other parts of Croatia but it has not been met with increased employment opportunities or greenfield investment.<br>

<b>Brief description :</b> The project aims at providing preparatory assistance to the UNDP office and the UN Country Team in Georgia to explore entry points and new opportunities for the UN system to engage in conflict prevention and peace and development initiatives and to contribute to the strengthening of national governmental and non-governmental capacities for conflict prevention and peace building from a national as well as sub-regional point of view.  This includes the restoration of confidence and peaceful coexistence in the conflict affected areas of the country as well as support to the complex and conflict prone democratic transition process that the country is currently experimenting. The programme supports the strengthening of national governmental and non-governmental capacities to address and manage different political challenges and contested issues in a sustainable and peaceful manner. Strengthening of national mechanisms for consensus-building, institutional strengthening of conflict resolution capacities on local and national levels, and the development leadership capacities will be critical for this purpose.<br>

<b>Brief description :</b> The project supports the CACs efforts to halt land degradation by enhancing the capability of each nation to execute their National Programming Frameworks. GEF support will result in (a) increased policy coherence; (b) resources effectively mobilized for SLM; (c) improved interaction between state agencies and land users through increased human resources; and (d) developed and strengthened learning, dissemination, and replication of best practices in collaborative SLM. Without this component project, the established multi-country and national support structures will not have the capacity for effective policy-making, planning, and financing SLM initiatives that will meet future challenges and changing land-use scenarios with new global challenges, such as the effects of global warming on agriculture and food systems.<br>

<b>Brief description :</b> The objective of the project is to mainstream biodiversity conservation priorities into Russian energy sector development policies and into the operations of energy production sectors through pilot activities in 8 demonstration areas of the country.  The expected exponential growth of Russia’s energy sector means a potential further rise in threats to biodiversity. Whether and to what extent these threats materialize depends on if the baseline course of action is corrected to address biodiversity risks.  The desired long-term solution is for Russia to adapt its legislation and policies to include legal requirements for energy sector actors to take into consideration biodiversity conservation, and to develop and test technologies to implement these requirements in each industry. By doing so, Russia will be able to both minimize the adverse impact of energy sector development on biodiversity, and motivate positive actions to conserve biodiversity. <br>

<b>Brief description :</b> The projcet is aimed at responding to currently identified three major challenges. Firstly, in relation to the lack of capacities for service provision at the local level the UNDP is supporting the Ministry of the Interior and municipalities through the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro in strengthening the inter-municipal cooperation as well as strengthening local public finances through better budgeting and support to improving allocation process of the equalization funds. Secondly, directly with municipalities the UNDP works on empowering of Municipal Assembly members and Secretary Generals by building administrative capacities to become more efficient and responsive to the local citizens needs and requests, as well as to exercise better their legislative power and their role of supervising the executive branch. Thirdly, the UNDP will contribute to understanding and addressing the human resource challenge at the local level by conducting a functional analysis for Montenegrin municipalities in close partnership with the European Union Delegation under the IPA 2010.<br>

The analysis and the recommendations will be constructed against the background of the vision of Montenegro in 15-20 years from now and will try to address two questions: 1. Who are we? and 2. Where are we going?. 
The NHDR is, for its broader outreach, presented though a TV serial (28 one hour programmes) “I have an attitude (Ja imam stav)” in cooperation with Atlas TV.<br>

<b>Brief description :</b> The project will support the government in realizing its goal of 15 to 20 MW of new small  generating capacity by the close of the project, instead of 2015 as declared by their strategy. Furthermore this project will support the government in securing that additional capacity in a more cost effective and economically responsible manner, and therefore in a more politically sustainable manner. The project will do this by supporting the Government of Montenegro (GoM) in:  streamlining and simplifying the application procedures for small renewable independent power producers; - collecting basic data to make investment decisions; - by setting attractive but competitive business terms and conditions for investors; - and helping the new Energy Efficiency (EE) and Renewable Energy Unit role out a streamlined and transparent tendering process.<br>
