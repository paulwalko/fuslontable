<b>POI:</b> Churnet Valley Railway<br>
<b>Address:</b> Kingsley &amp; Froghall Station, Froghall, Staffordshire<br>
<b>Post Code:</b> ST10 2HA<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Churnet Valley Railway takes you on a journey back to the classic days of railway travel on a rural line that passes through beautiful countryside known as Staffordshire's "Little Switzerland". Our picturesque stations offer lots of interest with a complete range of visitor facilities, and there's plenty more to see and enjoy along the way. In addition to the 11 mile return journey along the valley, there's a taste of contrasting moorland scenery on the 9 mile round trip to Ipstones Loop along the Cauldon branch.<br>
