<b>Title:</b> Best Beach Yoga<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>The same folks who decided that people should be able to ride a Ferris wheel where they fish have come up with, arguably, an even better combination. The Santa Monica Pier offers <b>ROGA</b> — running plus yoga — workouts on Saturday mornings for free at various times throughout the spring, summer and fall. Come at 8 a.m. to warm up with a two- or five-mile run and stay for yoga at 9 a.m. Yoga is led by a rotating list of Santa Monica&#39;s best yoga instructors. Friendly volunteers will hold onto your yoga mat and cheer you on while you run, then offer you refreshments from sponsors such as Clif Bar or Honest Tea when you need a boost of energy. Check the Santa Monica Pier website, sign up for the email list or \&quot;like\&quot; the Facebook page to make sure you&#39;re in the know. It&#39;s always nice to wake up to the waves, but having your workout done before brunch is another kind of heaven. —Eve Weston</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Healing Encounter With Animals<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>If you're feeling a bit blue, sometimes a nice animal cuddle is the best way to get your sense of hope back in order. Go hug a sheep, a cow, a goat or even a turkey at <b>the Gentle Barn</b>, a 6-acre rescue sanctuary that&#39;s home to more than 160 farm animals recovering from abuse or neglect. The mission of this special facility is to bring people and animals together to provide spiritual healing for all. Each animal at this rehabilitation center has lived through a sad hardship story, which is posted near its pen to create an even deeper bonding experience when you stop by. Visitors are encouraged to give love, hugs and attention to the animals. It&#39;s a wonderful feeling to sense their reciprocity. Seeing these formerly abused animals learn to trust the world again makes it possible to put your own worries into perspective. —Nikki Kreuzer</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Dance Lessons<br>

Luckily, fun and friendly <b>Evolution Studios</b> in the San Fernando Valley focuses purely on the art of tap dancing. Its Tap-a-holic class helps even those of you with two left feet learn to step, heel, toe and shuffle in easy-to-follow, Broadway-style beginning classes, and eventually work your way up to advanced workshops. You learn this vintage dance style with a group that&#39;s at your level, making it both nonintimidating and enjoyable. For those with a fitness goal in mind, this studio offers TAProbics, a cardio class that uses tap dance as its basis.

At eight Butterfly ping-pong tables arranged on a large, Olympic-style rubber floor, people flash \&quot;drop dead, pal\&quot; stares and smirks as they zap the ball across the net.

Think of it this way: You can lose fat and get your cardio going for about the price of cable TV, which has the opposite effect.

Inside, you&#39;re immediately hit by buzzes, bells, plinking and clacking. Before you sit down, you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s a mini-museum as well — thanks to the Looffs, a family who designed carousels across the United States. You can see their first carousel horse and bizarre funhouse figures, photos and paraphernalia — even the lead car from Cyclone Racer, the Pike&#39;s famed wooden roller coaster, which was set on a pier. Because this is gambling, the game is 21-and-over only, with photo ID required. You get a free trial run, then load up your game card with $10 or so (each game costs $1.20).

Beyond the looping path of the travertine outdoor labyrinth, you&#39;ll find a tiered garden with ponds and shady alcoves — a perfect place for more than 150 visitors each month to get in touch with their inner spirit. The Beaux-Arts mansion and gardens were completed in 1913 by Italian wine baron Secundo Guasti.

Founded in August 2010 by Rebecca Pontius, the Do Good Bus has taken trusting volunteers to work with organizations including MEND Poverty, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Social Justice Learning Institute and Enrich L.A. The organizers don&#39;t go so far as to drape a black bag over your head and drive you around in circles, but you never know where you&#39;ll wind up, and that&#39;s the magic. No matter where the road takes you, you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to feel good afterward, and that&#39;s not just because the last stop might be a bar. Have a drink.

Many go to synagogue, or spread out their finest lace tablecloth on the dining room table for an elegant meal. But in Silver Lake, the <b>East Side Jews</b> opt for quirky alternatives: a picnic at Grand Park; beer tasting at Golden Road Brewery; gatherings at Vietnamese restaurants, karaoke joints and comedy clubs.

<b>Title:</b> Best Composting Class<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Compost can be made up of almost everything you throw away in your kitchen: fruit scraps, vegetable waste, paper napkins, newspaper, even coffee grounds. But what is composting? It's a magic trick by which you turn trash into nutrient-rich soil (and help save the Earth). If you want to start composting, or just learn more, <b>Los Angeles County's Smart Gardening</b> workshops will teach you, for free, how to improve your lawn or garden while cutting waste. No reservation needed. Workshops are about 90 minutes, held at various learning centers, libraries, parks and schools around the county. After the workshop, you&#39;ll receive some seeds and mulch for your garden just for attending, and you can purchase composting bins at a discount — $40 for regular composting bins and $65 for \&quot;worm\&quot; composting bins, which include one-half pound of worms. At some workshops, they raffle a free composting bin. —Eve Weston</p>

On weekdays you can walk nine holes from dawn to 3 p.m. for just $16.50; twilight hours are $12.25 and super-twilight hours are $7.50 (weekends and holidays cost a bit more). At any hour of the day, seniors can walk nine holes for $10.50 and juniors for $3.75. One of the biggest draws is Altadena&#39;s driving range, which is entirely constructed on real grass, giving golfers a more realistic practice setting.

The workout is simple, no gimmicks and little chatter, just steady climbing or quick pedaling to an eclectic playlist — epic heartland rock, swampy industrial trip-hop, classic soul and funk, Top 40 R&amp;B and electro-pop. Even gritty grunge ballads. Whether it&#39;s Joan Jett&#39;s \&quot;Bad Reputation\&quot; or Journey&#39;s \&quot;Don&#39;t Stop Believing,\&quot; the right song always hits the speakers just as the crowd is wilting, and the hour simply speeds by. —Jessica Langlois</p>

The meandering walkways with heavy chain handrails have a Victorian feel but were actually restored in the 1970s.

<b>Title:</b> Best Garden Tour<br>

Perhaps you already guessed that the herbs, trees, bushes and flowers in these gardens are approximately what would have been planted at an ancient Roman villa, since the building is a re-creation of the Villa Papyri, buried when Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. It may, however, surprise you to learn that each plant had a specific medicinal, culinary or mythological use. The plants were so highly functional, in fact, that citizens could live a capsule existence within the villa if need be. If you get docent Donald Peterson as your tour guide, he&#39;ll regale you with tales of Mithridates, the Poison King, Rome&#39;s public enemy No. 1, a genius with natural toxins — and antidotes. Peterson is full of fascinating lore. Did you know that Roman soldiers drank catnip tea as a stimulant before battle? Or that water lilies, bay laurel and hellebore are all narcotics?

President Tom Seres and the other 150 or so members — who range in age from 30 to 100 — are devoted to their sport and are happy to provide free lessons. On the lawn, surrounded by some of the most expensive real estate in Southern California, the atmosphere is decidedly friendly. Everybody wears white. Everybody wears flat-soled rubber shoes (to preserve the grass). Between and even during games, everybody partakes of the complimentary light snack of coffee, fruit and pastries. All sports should be this genteel. —Gendy Alimurung</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Makeup Lessons<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>The <b>Donna Mee Agency</b>&#39;s private makeup application lessons go way beyond the usual \&quot;what foundation goes with my skin tone\&quot; advice you&#39;ll get at the mall. Mee and her army of artists specialize in corrective techniques and contouring (in the industry, Mee is known as \&quot;the makeup guru\&quot;). This means: how to create the illusion of better bone structure, how to make a round face look more oval, how to reduce a strong jaw line or double chin, and when to use a natural bristle brush versus synthetic. The lessons ($145 for 1½ hours or three hours for $250) focus on applying makeup strategically. Bring whatever cosmetics and tools you&#39;ve already got, and they&#39;ll teach you how to use them properly and/or suggest better ones. For an additional fee, Mee&#39;s artists will even go makeup shopping with you. —Gendy Alimurung</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Canyon Hike<br>

On weekends, the trailhead parking lots at the top of Los Liones Drive in Pacific Palisades fill quickly. But don&#39;t let the crowds deter you — they&#39;re there for a reason. The views along the trail are some of the best in Los Angeles. As you undertake the moderately steep, 3.5-mile hike to the overlook at Parker Mesa, you&#39;ll pass through lush patches of wildflowers and ivy. There are rest stops along the way, and you&#39;re rewarded at the top with a stunning, panoramic view of the entire Santa Monica coastline. In one sweep, hikers can see Catalina Island, Palos Verdes and the downtown skyline. Casual hikers should allow about 3½ to four hours to complete the 7-mile round trip. Bring plenty of water and a camera. —Chris Walker</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Dog Park<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Grassy dog parks in Los Angeles are hard to come by, let alone one in the shadow of our most iconic landmark. Yet <b>Lake Hollywood Park</b>, tucked away in the hills just below the Hollywood Sign, is just that. Technically it&#39;s not an off-leash dog park, just another on-leash park (which means it&#39;s irrigated, unlike most dog parks). But it has been appropriated by Hollywood dog owners whose pups need to let loose. There&#39;s no fence, but there is a concrete gutter running along the street side of the park, which works almost as well as a fence. It&#39;s right next to the Google Maps destination for \&quot;Hollywood Sign,\&quot; so an ice cream truck parks at the top of the hill to cater to tourists. If you don&#39;t have a dog, it&#39;s a lovely spot for a picnic. —Isaac Simpson</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Disc Golf<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Like regular golf, disc golf is more about enjoying the outdoors than the game itself. In 2006, the <b>Chavez Ridge Disc Golf Club</b> (CRDGC), a scruffy group of Echo Parkians, founded a world-class disc golf course in the forest hills of Elysian Park. One of the steepest DG courses in Southern California, it&#39;s known for its fantastic views of Dodger Stadium along the 18th hole. Members of the CRDGC, who daily haunt the gorgeous course, have been called the \&quot;sherpas\&quot; of L.A. disc golf. If you need a start-up kit, they&#39;ll hook you up. Need a group to play with? They&#39;re happy to show you the ropes. \&quot;It&#39;s a great sport for finding community,\&quot; says George Harding, a tournament director. \&quot;It&#39;s free, friendly and accessible.\&quot; It&#39;s also surprisingly popular: On Saturdays the course is usually full of happy disc golfers. —Isaac Simpson</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Place to Clown Around<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>David Bridel studied under French master clown Philippe Gaulier, who also counts Sacha Baron Cohen as a former student. Bridel holds numerous titles at USC and now, thanks to <b>the Clown School</b>, he&#39;s sharing his knowledge with L.A.&#39;s burgeoning buffoons. The school has separate classes for adults (seven Sundays, 5 to 9 p.m., for $525, with discounts for returning customers) and for kids (two hours apiece on Tuesday evenings and Saturday afternoons; $250 for five sessions). It also can act as therapy for those looking to bridge any weird gaps in their personalities. The dominant principle is that clowns should be able to celebrate their mistakes in public — willing to expose fears, biases, revelatory instincts and general idiosyncrasies to audiences, which is no easy task. Clowning helps those wishing to examine intimate and often guarded aspects of their personalities so they can acknowledge, integrate and celebrate their physical, psychological and emotional imperfections.

There&#39;s a whole lot of nothing up at Dawson Saddle — nothing man-made, that is.

<b>Title:</b> Best Hidden Park on an Old Oil Field<br>

Unified School District discovered toxic gasses underground at the very spot where it planned to build a school. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy offered a solution: Build a park.

<b>Title:</b> Best Illegal Hike<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>In 1929 an oceanview cliffside neighborhood in San Pedro began sinking swiftly into the sea, leaving behind only the homes' enormous, eerie concrete foundations. Two homes were destroyed and the rest were quickly relocated, while the earth continued slipping until the mid-1930s. Now colloquially known as <b>Sunken City</b>, the broken shards of concrete have been covered and recovered with colorful graffiti, creating the impression of a post-apocalyptic graveyard, which contrasts interestingly with the infinity of the clear blue Pacific. Although \&quot;No Trespassing\&quot; signs abound, that doesn&#39;t dissuade urban explorers from sliding under the fence to inspect the picturesque and brightly colored ruins, just as area teenagers have for decades. While hiking the fractured cliff is certainly dangerous, it&#39;s also romantic. Artistic photo opportunities are as limitless here as are chances for secluded rendezvous.

The main dining room's tiled floors and wooden walls are offset by subtle modern touches: Some light fixtures are made of rope and filament bulbs, while others have shades that look enamel but are made of pottery.

The addition of shaved radishes and puckery cornichons. But mainly it&#39;s the butter: Despite those other elements, this is primarily a butter sandwich, and butter (French, demi-sel beurre baratte, to which chef Ludo Lefebvre adds a touch of buckwheat honey) is mainly what you taste while chowing down. All the other components are merely a conveyance method for that delicious butter. Mmmmm, butter. —Besha Rodell</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Breakfast<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>For those of us who spend our lives seeking out fabulous meals, the unremarkable roster of $14 egg dishes that many restaurants call a breakfast menu can get incredibly tiresome. But with chef Felix Barron's masterful, creative breakfast and brunch dishes, <b>KTCHN</b> offers a welcome respite from egg fatigue. The concept began as a culinary-class space and downtown pop-up, and Barron still operates the weekend brunch pop-up at Ebanos Crossing. But he&#39;s also found a more permanent space in Old Town Pasadena, adjacent to Eddie Ruiz&#39;s Picnik. There, KTCHN is open on weekends for breakfast and brunch, serving produce-driven, gorgeous plates of food such as a late summer squash scramble with sautéed squash, onions, chipotle tomato butter, mozzarella and potatoes with brioche toast. French toast is made with coconut flan batter, and the apple fritters are some of the best fried dough around. Barron pays as much attention to creative plating as any dinner chef, and the pretty results make shelling out for breakfast seem all the more worthwhile. —Besha Rodell</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Wine Bar<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>A wine bar, at its best, is buoyed by the quality of its conversation as much as its wine selection. That's part of what we love about <b>Bar Covell</b>, the Los Feliz wine bar run by Dustin Lancaster and Matthew Kaner. There&#39;s no menu — when you belly up, the bartender will gauge your tastes and mood and drinking proclivities, and suggest a few wines you might enjoy. This sets the tone for Covell in general, a place where you might strike up a conversation with your neighbors, or be invited to partake in someone else&#39;s bottle and banter. The selection is always appropriate for wine nerds and casual drinkers alike. There is also the small fact of Los Angeles&#39; dearth of proper wine bars — a niche Covell pretty much has locked down. We hope it gets more competition in the coming years, but it will almost certainly still be the best. —Besha Rodell</p>

And then there&#39;s the cafe, which is also in the lobby, and which sells all kinds of baked goods, including the best cookies in town. All the cookies are damn tasty, but the one we tend to swoon over is the mocha chip cookie, a rich chocolate fudge-y wonder with the bitter edge of dark coffee and an assertive kick of salt. Pastry chef Marian Mar, who used to work at New York&#39;s Momofuku Milk Bar, turns out all manner of delicious sweet treats, and she proves that you can get pretty wild and still retain a heavy dose of pure, childish glee. That&#39;s certainly what her cookies deliver, sea salt and all. —Besha Rodell</p>

And there&#39;s definitely no place more cozy and romantic than Lucques, where the roaring fireplace is upstaged only by the elegant, thoughtful food.

You can return to the buffet as many times as you want, and you also get a bottomless pot of tea. Any leftover scones in the basket on your table will be wrapped up for you to take home.

And if you want a caffeinated kick, there&#39;s the Turkish coffee shake, made with 40-hour cold-steep coffee from Rocchio Family Roasters, house-made Italian almond milk, cardamom, figs, Medjool dates, South American cacao powder, cacao nibs, banana and a pinch of sea salt.

<b>Title:</b> Best Affogato<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Among the many excellent mash-ups in the food world, one of the simplest and most blissful is the affogato, the marriage of two of Italy's finest exports, espresso and gelato. The word comes from the Italian <i>affogare</i>, meaning \"to drown,\" and it's a pretty accurate summation of the dish, in which a scoop of ice cream is submerged, or close to it, in a shot or double shot of espresso. At <b>Bucato</b> in Culver City, chef Evan Funke feels very strongly about how things are made, particularly Italian things. Get the Spago-trained, L.A.-bred, Italy-obsessed chef on the subject of properly orchestrated pasta or porchetta and you&#39;ll be at his restaurant all day. Just imagine the thoughts he has about gelato and espresso. (An imperfectly made affogato, after all, can seem like a crappy milkshake instead of a blissful union of two art forms.) Thus Funke&#39;s affogato is a work of art: a demitasse filled with a single scoop of Nocino gelato, made in-house on Funke&#39;s PacoJet with Nocino, a walnut liqueur from Emilia-Romagna. At table, Funke will gently pour the espresso, pulled from the espresso maker he inherited from Kazuto Matsusaka&#39;s Beacon, the beans roasted up the street at the Conservatory for Coffee, Tea &amp; Cocoa. You&#39;ll be given a spoon and maybe a moment of silence, well-deserved. —Amy Scattergood</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best New Restaurant<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Who'd have thought that the best new restaurant of the year would come from a TV personality who makes most of his money as the face of a supermarket chain in his home country of Australia? Yet that's what Curtis Stone has delivered in <b>Maude</b>, his tiny Beverly Hills restaurant, which feels intensely personal — the very opposite of what we&#39;ve come to expect from our celebrity chefs. Each month, Stone focuses on one seasonal ingredient and creates a nine-course menu around it. Over the summer months, corn, tomatoes and berries got their time in the spotlight; moving into fall and winter, we&#39;ll see pears, truffles (in November) and winter squash. A monthly ingredient of honor might become burdensome and repetitive in a lesser chef&#39;s hands, but Stone understands balance. Throughout the meal, the flavor is amplified and then subdued, in places used as the main attraction and in others as a subtle garnish. The result is always a lovely meditation on the season, a subtly thrilling meal that feels special in all the right ways. —Besha Rodell

There&#39;s artwork and hand-knit tapestries by local artists for sale on the walls, 5 percent of profits going to environmental causes and a free-for-all pedaling policy.

At Providence, those offerings are especially generous, and especially delicious. If you&#39;ve dined here before, you&#39;ll recognize the tiny taco made of raw scallops, sushi rice and a nasturtium leaf. A littleneck clam gets chopped and set back in its shell in a chorizo consommé with flecks of bell pepper. Chorizo also shows up in lollipop form, on the end of a stick along with a piece of squid, wrapped in a sunburst pinwheel. Presentation is always as fun as the food itself — one recent amuse came in a Cuban cigar box.

<b>Title:</b> Best Sushi<br>

There are no shiny valet stands, just a small, grungy lot next to the edifice that houses this phenomenal 2-year-old sushi restaurant — which itself is shaped like a chili bowl, thanks to its previous incarnation as a Chili Bowl restaurant. All of this is to say that Shunji is not your average sushi place. Sushi chef and owner Nakao Shunji has a pedigree (an original chef at Matsuhisa, co-founder with his brother of Asanebo) that might warrant something more hushed and formal, but instead you get exactly the kind of happy atmosphere you want from a sushi joint, especially one inside a chili bowl. The <i>omakase</i> is perfectly executed but also great fun, the specials on roving chalkboards. You might find yourself savoring uni wrapped in <i>nori</i> like a debutante's sash, or local raw shrimp that still move, if you're lucky, before they're fried into beautiful artwork. You might also get a dish in which a tomato is somehow magically transformed to resemble a dish of <i>agadashi</i> tofu. Or a tiny dish of squid ink and squid and black truffles, topped with a raw quail egg. All this in a place where you can dress as you like, get yelled at as if you&#39;re in a ramen shop and find cheap specials at both lunch and dinnertime. —Amy Scattergood</p>

At $150 a head (or a whopping $350 for the seasonal white truffle tasting, which starts Oct. 23 and is offered for about a month), it&#39;s a splurge, to put it mildly. But a dining experience this unusual probably is worth every penny. —Andy Hermann

<b>Title:</b> Best Seven-Course Beef Dinner<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Vietnam probably is best known in the world's culinary sphere for its street food: simple in its preparation, stellar in its use of fresh ingredients. Less well known is Vietnam's haute cuisine, which is at times appropriately extravagant and served at weddings or banquets. One of the most common wedding preparations is <i>bò bay món</i>, a varied seven-course beef dinner, which includes a light beef salad, ground beef steamed in lolot leaves, and the clear beef soup that functions as Vietnam's version of congee (the popular rice porridge). There are also those utterly delicious, lemongrass-infused beef patties, <i>bò nuong mo chài</i>, which are good enough to make you question everything you've ever thought about a meatball. When Vietnamese choose to dine in style in L.A., they head to <b>Thien An Bo 7 Mon</b>, a place renowned for both its <i>bò bay món</i> and its giant, gorgeously ornate baked catfish. —James Gordon</p>

<b>body:</b> <p>No, we're not talking about the best selection of dishes; it's the actual physical menu at <b>Shanghai No. 1 Seafood Village</b> that impresses. The spot's food list is pretty much a coffee-table book: a massive, glossy tome with huge, gorgeous photos of each dish that wouldn't be out of place in <i>Saveur</i>, along with articles (in Chinese only, unfortunately) about the restaurant's namesake city. As befits its San Gabriel Valley location (and its status as the first American location of a Shanghai-based chain), you can expect rigorously authentic Chinese dishes, including crab prepared in myriad ways, braised mutton, jellyfish salad and many, many more. At night, there are banquet-style entrees; during the day, there's a great selection of dim sum. Don't miss the <i>sheng jian bao</i>, rich, broth-filled pork buns that are steamed and then dipped halfway in hot oil, making for a half-crunchy, half-chewy, fully delicious experience.

<b>Title:</b> Best Ice Cream Shop<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>When Leo Bulgarini opened <b>Bulgarini Gelato</b> in the spring of 2007, in the back of an enormous parking lot in the upper atmosphere of Altadena, the little gelateria felt like a secret-handshake society. For Westsiders, it may as well have been on Mars; even for locals, it was hard to find, hidden behind all that concrete. The hours were inconstant, the flavors erratic, and Bulgarini would sometimes close his shop to go on beautiful pistachio hunts — in his native Italy. Seven years later, although there&#39;s a second outpost in Culver City, little has changed in the original shop — which is why we still love it so much. There are movie nights on summer Saturday evenings, when often-obscure foreign films are projected onto more concrete, this time vertical walls. During World Cup season, the place opens for certain Italian soccer matches. A few years ago, Bulgarini fashioned a marble altar to his Rome-made copper Elektra espresso machine. And, of course, there&#39;s Leo&#39;s always spectacular gelato: the near-legendary pistachio (the nuts carried home in his suitcase), goat&#39;s milk-cacao nib, blood orange, yogurt and olive oil, chocolate and salt. One could go on. Maybe just point your car north and upward. —Amy Scattergood</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Salad<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>A trip to <b>Jitlada</b> is for many Angelenos a kind of pilgrimage. If you love Thai food, particularly Southern Thai in its many degrees of spiciness, from pleasant to outrageous, you come for the curries that Suthiporn (Tui) Sungkamee makes from scratch in the back, curries that date from when he was about 13 and started cooking at home (he's never cooked at a restaurant not his own). If you love <i>The Simpsons</i>, you come to eat your green curry mussels under one of the many drawings that longtime regular Matt Groening has given to the restaurant. If you love danger, you come for the Dynamite Challenge, an absurdly spicy dish that Sungkamee put on the menu about four years ago, for fun or maybe just to hear people scream. If you love burgers, you come to persuade Sungkamee&#39;s sister Sarintip (Jazz) Singsanong to make you one of her special Thai hamburgers. But if you love everything here, as many of us do, you seem to come most often for the Morning Glory salad, a soothing plate of tempura-fried greens combined with onions and shrimp and fresh herbs in a syrupy tart sauce. It&#39;s neither as intricate nor as dangerous as the two or three hundred other things Sungkamee might conceivably make for you, but it&#39;s a fantastic dish that may well be the most addictive thing in the restaurant. Well, other than Ryan Gosling. —Amy Scattergood</p>

But <b>Art's Chili Dog Stand</b> should come to mind almost as quickly. Opened by ex–New Yorker Art Elkind in the late 1940s, the tiny stand near the corner of Florence and Normandie was visited by food writers David Shaw and Ruth Reichl, who praised both the dogs and Art himself. Art died in 1990, but the chili dogs he named remain the same: casing-free, all-meat dogs (made specially for Art&#39;s by nearby Meadow Farms) that are loaded with chili and served on a steamed bun. The late, great Art believed in keeping it simple — a tradition that, thankfully, continues. —Jim Thurman</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best South L.A. Cafe<br>
<b>body:</b> <p><b>3 Worlds Cafe</b> originated at South L.A.&#39;s Jefferson High School as a way for teens to learn healthful eating habits while concocting fruit smoothies sweetened with agave and coconut milk. Soon enough, they were selling up to 200 smoothies a day under the guidance of chef Roy Choi (Kogi, POT, the world). So, in the summer of 2013, Choi, a local nonprofit and the Dole Food Company teamed up to launch the cafe, hiring students to serve mango and strawberry banana smoothies along with coffees, teas, fruits and baked goods. The name pays tribute to the Latinos, Asians and African-Americans who have lived in the neighborhood for generations, attesting to 3 Worlds&#39; commitment to community. Located among mom-and-pop shops and fast-food joints on a strip that was home to jazz clubs a century ago, 3 Worlds is a homey place, with comfy recliners, vivid murals, free Wi-Fi and cheery baristas.

<b>Title:</b> Prettiest Restaurant<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>When Walter and Margarita Manzke and business partner Bill Chait took over the Campanile space to open <b>République</b>, it seemed that all of L.A. held its breath to see what would happen. Would the food be as good as it was in Campanile&#39;s heyday? And would the gorgeous building (interior courtyard, vaulted ceilings, tiled fountain, clocktower) still be as breathtakingly pretty? Two years and lots of sandblasting, painting, repiping and retiling later, the answer is yes and YES. Originally a faux-Andalusian brick complex commissioned by Charlie Chaplin as office space, the building was bought by Larry Silverton (Nancy&#39;s father) in 1987, at which point it became Campanile and the original home of La Brea Bakery. Chait hired architect Osvaldo Maiozzi, but Manzke did much of the work himself, shipping materials from his wife&#39;s native Philippines, enlisting family members to help and recycling stuff from Campanile. The results are stunning. Filament lights drop down from the reworked ceiling like hung stars. The fountain (now outside) churns water easily visible from the glassed-in, opened-up main dining room. Wooden communal tables stretch lengthwise under the skylights — the open kitchen on one side and on the other, an open bakery near hanging, house-made charcuterie in cases and a wine room — as if you&#39;re in the best farmhouse kitchen in the world. Maybe you are. —Amy Scattergood</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Farmers Market<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Decades before farmers markets were held every day, and in practically every neighborhood in Los Angeles, before they became as hip and ubiquitous (and necessary) as iPhones, the <b>Wednesday Santa Monica Farmers Market</b> was quietly setting up produce stalls. The market started in 1981, before you could even get fresh herbs in grocery stores (gasp!), and in the years since, it has matured into what many would agree is this city's flagship market. Managed for almost all of that time by Laura Avery, now white-haired but showing little sign of slowing down, the market has neither stagnated nor declined. Instead it's operated as a kind of incubator, showcasing start-up bakeries (Red Bread, Roan Mills) and heirloom fruit farmers (Andy's Farm), as it hosts food trucks (Border Grill is a regular) and radio shows (KCRW's <i>Good Food</i>), while locals buy dinner, chefs pick out what to put on the night&#39;s menu and sometimes politicians — or Mario Batali — make Instagram-worthy pit stops, trailing ripe tomatoes and TV camera crews. —Amy Scattergood</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Working Breakfast<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>In any city, certain local bakeries and coffee shops operate as a network of anti-Starbucks places where people hook up to Wi-Fi and order a coffee and a pastry and literally plug in. In Los Angeles, a city that runs on freelancers and writers (your screenplay, my food blog), there are plenty of these waystations but fewer top-notch restaurants where this is possible than you'd perhaps expect. This has changed recently, and most happily so on the Westside, with the opening of <b>Superba Food + Bread</b>. It&#39;s a terrific jigsaw of a restaurant, with a bakery, a coffee shop and an all-day restaurant fitted seamlessly into a former garage. When it opens at 7 a.m., the parking lot is mostly empty, the pastries and breads are still warm, and the Wi-Fi is running as smoothly as the La Marzocco. Order a Gibraltar from the barista, a smoked duck croissant from the pastry chef, and get an hour&#39;s work done before the full breakfast starts, at which point chef Jason Travi may bring you your plate of Moroccan eggs himself. —Amy Scattergood</p>

But this is not a boring brownie; rather, it&#39;s an exercise in chocolate.

Like many of the other desserts here, and at the other restaurants Nathan runs with husband Josh Loeb (Milo &amp; Olive, Rustic Canyon), the brownies strike the perfect balance between comfort food and pastry-chef dessert.

It&#39;s a modest and cheery place, with big tables and great service, and the owners probably will serve you themselves, chatting as if you were in their home, which is what the place feels like (and kind of is). The Oaxacan food — chicken and <i>mole negro</i> tamales served in the banana leaves they were cooked in, <i>clayudas</i> the size of frying pans — is wonderful.

Although there&#39;s also lamb barbacoa, order the goat, or barbacoa enchilada, which will come to you pull-apart tender, having been cooked for five hours in the rich scarlet guajillo chile broth that also comes with the dish, in a separate bowl. There is a cabbage and cilantro slaw, wedges of lime, a bowl of house-made tortillas, and a plate of <i>pancita</i>, the blood sausage­–like offal dish.

<b>Title:</b> Best Duck on a Grill<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>A daunting number of Korean barbecue restaurants exist in L.A.&#39;s Koreatown, from which you can order ribs and slabs of beef and all manner of pork belly, cooked to smoky, Hite-fueled perfection at your table. But if that seems passé by now, you might try the duck palace on Olympic that is <b>Sun Ha Jang</b>. The little shop has been open for 20 or so years, but seven years ago duck was added to the menu, and folks have been flocking to the place ever since. Thin slices of young duckling (from Pitman Family Farms) is lovely stuff to throw on a grill, particularly one set into the middle of your table. The waterfowl is mildly funky and thick with fat, and thus pairs exceedingly well with the plates of lettuces and leeks and assorted <i>banchan</i> that fill your table. If this seems somewhat light fare, it&#39;s on purpose, as the duck is the appetizer: The real show is what comes after, when the copious duck fat is used to fry up a bowl of rice and the remains of whatever&#39;s left on your table into perhaps the best fried rice you&#39;ve had in your life. Close your eyes and imagine your favorite takeout, as orchestrated by Paula Wolfert over a fire in southwest France. OK, maybe just head to Koreatown. —Amy Scattergood</p>

The Tokyo-based company makes what most people consider L.A.'s best ramen, purist iterations of Hakata-style noodles that have engendered not only crowds and accolades but also appearances in ramen festivals and, last year, an annex across the street. There are also bowls of superior <i>tsukemen</i>, or dip noodles, as well as other non-noodle dishes (although who would order those here?). In this age of ramen, L.A. has been blessed with very good bowls of the stuff, crazy odes to pig in the form of <i>tonkotsu</i>, Chinese-inspired bowls of spicy black ramen, Italian-inspired bowls with tomato and cheese, even ramen burgers. But for a beautifully orchestrated bowl filled with chewy noodles, complex broth, the option of a perfectly cooked egg and classic condiments, best get in line at Tsujita.

Fans of Spudnuts extol the doughnuts as lighter, fluffier and moister than their counterparts. While Spudnuts doughnuts aren&#39;t likely to make aficionados forget Stan&#39;s or Donut Man, let alone dissuade transplants from their Dunkin&#39; Donuts nostalgia, there&#39;s a reason Spudnuts is still around, even after all these years.

Taking on the challenge of education and the risk of alienating conventional beer drinkers (all pints are poured at a balmy 56 degrees), MacLeod sticks to its guns and provides quality brews — from the Yorkshire Pale to the 60 Shilling Scotch Ale — that are a great introduction to the real ales of the British Isles. —Sarah Bennett</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Biryani<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Forget about paella and risotto. There's a much more exciting rice dish at <b>Bangla Bazar &amp; Restaurant</b> on West Third Street in the strip known as Little Bangladesh. It&#39;s goat biryani, spicy rice studded with gamey-tasting, bony pieces of goat. The rice is like a spice market on a plate, studded with the heady aromatics you find in Indian-Bangladeshi food: whole cinnamon sticks, bay leaves and big, black cardamom pods. Spicy chile, too. And dribbles of yellow splotching the rice like sunshine. This in-your-face food commands attention. To do it justice, you should eat with your hands — right hand only, please — like the Bangladeshis around you, because the tactile sensation is as important to the flavor as the spices. All you need to turn this into a perfect meal is a bracing cup of chai, which the restaurant provides, and a hand rinse when you&#39;re done. —Barbara Hansen

We&#39;re not talking about haute cuisine, of course, but this kind of comfort food tastes pretty heavenly when you&#39;ve spent the morning traversing the woodsy wilderness — especially if you hiked up the Mount Wilson trail to get here. Best bets include the turkey sandwich, grilled chicken breast with pesto on naan bread, coleslaw, apple pie and ice cream sundaes. The cafe isn&#39;t open in the winter months. But on weekends from April through November, in addition to food, you can pick up observatory souvenirs there, as well as the Wilderness Pass you&#39;ll need in order to park in the National Forest (all proceeds support the observatory).

The restaurant makes a startling showcase of its impressive indoor-outdoor space, which is among the best in Los Angeles, but when the risotto cart emerges from the kitchen, it galvanizes the room. Entire tables crane their necks to get a look at the 80-pound wheel of two-year aged Parmigiano Reggiano with the hole carved into the center. That's where the risotto's aged organic Acquerello rice goes, still steaming from its slow cook in the kitchen. Worked tableside, the creamy rice gets imbued with all of that aged cheesy goodness, plus handfuls of mushrooms, direct from Italy. For a final decadent punch, funky black truffles can be shaved directly on top of the <i>risotto al funghi porcini finito al tavolo</i> — for an equally audacious price, of course. —Farley Elliott</p>

A couple years ago, Little London Fish &amp; Chips formally became <b>Borneo Kalimantan Cuisine</b>, expanding its menu to include about 50 options, including Borneo-style <i>laksa</i>; the buttery, pan-fried bread called <i>roti</i>, and such standard Indonesian favorites as the peanut salad called <i>gado-gado</i>. Despite the expansion, the requisite order is still <i>mi hokkian</i> (Hokkianese noodles), which are executed to perfection: curly, tensile and bouncy enough to remind you of a phone cord; chewy enough that each thread is savored rather than slurped.

Most importantly, Gold Room kept its impossibly priced, 31-year-running, loss-leader: a shot of tequila and a beer for $4. No other transitional neighborhood&#39;s watering hole has hit all the right notes with both locals and scenesters, and you can see them all peacefully rubbing elbows any night of the week. It&#39;s a place that promises never to change in the philosophical sense, which is why it remains not only the best bar in Echo Park but one of the best in all of Southern California. —Paul T.

<b>Title:</b> Best Vegan Restaurant<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>There aren't many vegan restaurants where you could take omnivores and reasonably hope that they won't notice the absence of meat and dairy, but <b>Crossroads</b> is just such a place. As swank as any other West Hollywood hot spot, its plush, red velvet booths and soft, yellow orb lighting betrays no hint of hippie undertones. The wine list is better than at most meat palaces in town. And the food is mainly creative small plates, which pack as much flavor as any kind of diner might want. The secret here is to rely on the vegetables themselves, and to put them in creative contrast with herbs, spices and nuts. Flatbreads come with smoked sweet corn, roasted okra and cherry tomatoes; kale spanakopita comes with tomato fondue and mint oil; and even the \"crabcakes\" made with hearts of palm have a light, delicious charm. If this is veganism, we're all for it. —Besha Rodell

But $150 later, your meal is done, and you'd better believe they want that table back. So what's a thirsty couple to do? Head to <b>Willie Jane</b>, of course! One of the best restaurants on this hipper-than-thou block also has a surprisingly swell, and generously sized, bar to keep the party going. Darkly lit, romantic and lively all at once, it boasts a superb list of craft cocktails, genuinely nice barkeeps and surprisingly swift service. We&#39;re positively obsessed with the Smoke, which combines rye, Fernet Branca, lemon and smoked honey for $12. (They even burn some hickory and trap the smoke in the glass, which adds an extra note to the drink.) There&#39;s also a communal table — which makes much more sense in a bar than in the usual awkward dinner context — and a lounge area, so even on crowded nights, you can usually score a seat.

This means that the space is extremely simple — a few small tables in a small room with a low ceiling — but that seems appropriate when sampling Burmese curries rarely found outside of the streets of Southeast Asia. We&#39;re quite happy to eat in any setting where the tea-leaf salad is as pungent and garlicky as this one is, and where there are enough interesting noodle dishes that it&#39;s worth inventing excuses to go out to lunch.

<b>Title:</b> Best San Fernando Valley Burger Stand<br>

The friendly curmudgeon is so beloved that his ex-wife still regularly runs the register. Truth be told, Elwell&#39;s fans may just be sticking around for the SoCal-style burgers, which arrive as perfectly salted thin beef patties, with plenty of spread and shredded lettuce. Most get American cheese, of course, which Elwell slings from chest-high onto each cooking burger — sometimes whether you asked for it or not. —Farley Elliott

But once you get past the burly security guards and the (hopefully) ironic \&quot;please check your guns at the door\&quot; sign, the place reveals itself as a gorgeously restored Western saloon, whose immaculate, mirror-paneled, dark wooden bar stretches from one end of the train car–shaped tavern to the other. The jukebox, $3 cans of Olympia and a mounted buffalo head are relics of a simpler time, but every night&#39;s a party at the Monty.

Del Rey's breakfast menu acts as a calling card for the humble Raygoza, who cranks out pounds of his family-recipe chorizo, including a green Tolucan <i>verde</i> version, from his home in Culver City.

<b>Title:</b> Best Unusual Pan Dulce<br>

They're made from scratch from a recipe as old as the bakery, which opened in 1952. The formula blends whole wheat and all-purpose flours. The tricky part is getting the sugar to stick to the surface without falling off, because it isn't glued on with a sticky flour paste.

Whether during the design stage in the computer or in the production phase in the shop, subtle adjustments evolve the boards over time — fine tooling for wind resistance (like adding an aerodynamic tail) or the slightest cupped indentation for ergonomic foot positioning might get added along the way. Loaded&#39;s products develop from compound geometries that could only be produced via industrial design software, which translates the digital information to fabrication machines such as compression molders and superplastic formers — the same techniques the aerospace industry uses to achieve complex curves. Loaded&#39;s graphics are meticulous, too, such as eight-sided cubic prisms and kaleidoscopic fractals that are simultaneously subtle and stylish — they hint at the math-nerd side of the shop&#39;s skater-cool culture. —Wendy Gilmartin</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Arcade Bar<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Unlike what you might imagine an adult arcade to be like, <b>EightyTwo</b> is not the sweaty domain of grown-up nerds. Rather, it&#39;s a video game paradise that&#39;s as sleek as it is chic. Housed in a metallic, 2,000-square-foot warehouse, this Arts District cocktail bar boasts 15 pinball machines — which date from 1977&#39;s Ed Krynski–designed Jungle Queen to last year&#39;s uber-badass Metallica pinball. It also has 25 video games, from Atari&#39;s 1978 classic Space Invaders to 1993&#39;s NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat II. Nightly DJ sets transform the game room into a late-night dance party, and a tree-lined courtyard with communal high-top tables offers sweet refuge from even the most grueling round of Pac-Man. There&#39;s nothing quite as electrifying as getting your game on at EightyTwo, even if much of its clientele isn&#39;t old enough to remember the year (an amazing one for video games) for which it&#39;s named. —Jennifer Swann</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Storage Company<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>The idea behind L.A.-based <b>Clutter</b> is so ingenious, we can&#39;t believe it took until 2013 for someone to make it happen. Simply put, it&#39;s a storage space where they pick up, and later retrieve, your crap for you. The idea is a storage unit that keeps a \&quot;visual inventory\&quot; of everything they&#39;re holding on your behalf, and quickly produces what you want when you want it — more along the lines of an archive than your usual sad rows of boxes of stuff. We will admit, though: We&#39;re still stuck on the part where they pick up your stuff. No hauling boxes, no renting trucks, no shlepping out to Timbuktu? It&#39;s enough to make you hold onto that 300-pound antique table from Granny, even if you&#39;re secretly convinced you&#39;ll never be rich enough to have room for it. Moving a bunch of clothes or books off-site? They&#39;ll even send over the boxes to hold them. Now that&#39;s genius. —Sarah Fenske</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Outdoor Dining<br>

If you want the most stunning view in town, go to Nobu Malibu. But if you want the best food in the most beautiful setting, head instead to <b>A.O.C.</b>, which has, in its transplanted location, a gorgeous garden patio. The space, which you get to through double French doors along the side of the restaurant, feels like dining at a Tuscan villa. A large brick fireplace heats the patio on colder nights, and the twinkle of lights and babble of conversation make it one of the most convivial spots to dine anywhere. Best of all, you get to eat Suzanne Goin's Euro-Californian cuisine and drink from the fantastic wine list, from Goin's business partner, Caroline Styne, and a terrific cocktail menu, too. This is, in fact, the best outdoor dining in L.A., as well as being one of the prettiest spaces. <i>8700 W. Third St., Beverly Grove, 90048.

But what about a great tuna sandwich, one you might crave even in the dead of night? That's what they serve at <b>Sopressata at Black Hogg</b>, the daytime sandwich operation out of the Silver Lake restaurant Black Hogg. As the name suggests, there's an emphasis on Italian cold cuts. Those sandwiches are pretty great, but the thing that keeps us coming back is the tuna sandwich. Served on a super-crusty roll, the pole-caught, sustainable American tuna comes with arugula, a punch of sweet aged balsamic and extra virgin olive oil. The secret to the luxuriant nature of the sandwich is the soft-boiled eggs, which sit atop the tuna in generous halves, giving the whole thing a rich, creamy nature. It's not a reinvention of the tuna sandwich, but it is very good ingredients put together extremely well. —Besha Rodell

This is the signature Hunan dish, and it&#39;s big and shareable and insanely tasty. It&#39;s also both an Instagram favorite and an enjoyable way to unsettle any less-than-adventurous members of your dinner party. What you get is a fish head in a bowl — and what a fish head it is. At <b>Hunan Mao</b>, a bustling restaurant in yet another food-intensive strip mall in the San Gabriel Valley, the fish head will be presented to you as the gift that it is, in a very large and pretty bowl, covered with a collage of diced chiles, intensely fragrant with sesame oil and copious bits of peppermint. You&#39;ll need to deconstruct your fish head: Just stack the bits of bone on a plate and keep working. The bowl of rice and repeating pots of tea should tame the heat of the chiles, which isn&#39;t really fire as much as the happy Novocaine of Sichuan cooking. If you order the house-smoked ham, which you absolutely should, you can take a break from fish work. And even if you manage to consume the whole fish (eyeballs included, please), be sure to take the last ladlefuls of broth home. It makes a terrific sauce for noodles. —Amy Scattergood</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Dairy Queen Alternative<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Hand-churned ice cream made from organic dairy with fennel and bee pollen is all well and good, but the madeleine that takes us back to childhood bliss is a far less complicated proposition: a Blizzard from Dairy Queen. Or at least it ought to be less complicated. While gourmet ice cream palaces are popping up on seemingly every corner in L.A., the city is bereft of the DQ chain, save one lone outlet at the Westfield Culver City mall. But don't despair: Home-grown <b>Foster's Freeze</b>, with 90 locations across California, turns out to be almost an exact copy of the ice cream chain that transplants remember from their elementary school days, down to the walk-up window and not-very-good chili cheeseburgers. The only difference is that here you order a Twister. Thicker than a McFlurry, studded with Reese&#39;s Peanut Cups, Butterfinger or something else equally horrible for you, Twisters are a reminder that sometimes the best things in life don&#39;t change — they just come under a different label. —Sarah Fenske

<b>Title:</b> Best Fast-Casual Restaurant<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Cheerfully stylish, determinedly Californian in both ingredients and outlook, <b>Lemonade</b> has been taking the state by storm. From the original West Hollywood outpost, chef Alan Jackson has grown his empire to 17 outlets — with the chain&#39;s first international locations recently opening in Dubai. It&#39;s easy to see the appeal: The cafeteria-style setup means that you get your food even more quickly than at a place such as Panera, and the wonderful variety means that you could spend a month here and still not eat your way through all the possible combinations of seasonal salads, sandwiches and braised meats. (We&#39;re partial to the snow pea \&quot;spaghetti,\&quot; shaved and served with cotija, corn and creamy lemon, but the Moroccan chicken isn&#39;t bad either.) Beyond that, Lemonade&#39;s look is just so gosh-darn adorable, with cement block wells featuring acres of bright green blades of grass, clever lighting and yellow plastic chairs and booths. You can&#39;t help but feel a little happier just walking in the door. Or maybe you&#39;re just looking ahead to the moment you gobble down one of those to-die-for lemon bars.

<b>Title:</b> Best Offbeat Valley Concert Venue<br>

First tapped by Leopold Stokowski for his youth orchestra, La Waldo went on to play violin for film soundtracks, record her own exotica albums and consort in Latin America with the likes of Diego Rivera and Yma Sumac. How can you get in on this action, you ask? Well, Waldo has a compound in Northridge, called <b>Rancho Cordillera del Norte</b>, which is not only a repository of her collection of Pre-Columbian instruments but also a showplace for a range of concerts in a Mission-style theater. All are either conducted by, or presided over by, the maestra. The featured music includes Mayan, Incan, Chinese, Vietnamese and Mexican, as well as other genres connected to California.

You can even have a Japanese-style highball with a dash of soda. Everything for a proper tasting is here: droppers for a dash of water to open up the taste, deeply knowledgeable whiskey connoisseurs behind the bar and fellow patrons who have great reverence for the distilled spirit. You may want to take a taste from the premises&#39; prized bottles, including cult bourbons from Pappy Van Winkle, Irish-made 21-year Redbreast and the Balvenie&#39;s 14-year single malt.

Founded in remembrance of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the drum circle (or \&quot;drum church,\&quot; as some call it) has evolved into an L.A. tradition all its own, appropriately located in the city&#39;s historic hub for African-American arts and culture. Running from from 2 p.m. to sunset, it features professionals and amateurs alike jamming on instruments ranging from djembes and maracas to cowbells. Onlookers beat imaginary congas in the air, kids bounce their basketballs to the beat, and others dance joyously at the circle&#39;s center. The atmosphere is especially festive during the Leimert Park Art Walk on the last Sunday of every month, when vendors sell wares and crafts on the grass. —Daina Beth Solomon</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Bar in Playa del Rey<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Pleasantly scruffy and charmingly low-key, the <b>Prince o' Whales</b> is the kind of bar they just don&#39;t make in Los Angeles these days. This is not a place to see and be seen or, heaven forbid, sip the latest mixology trends. This is a place to drink and, if you&#39;re feeling ambitious, play a game of ping pong or pinball. There&#39;s kind of a half-hearted nautical motif going on — whale carved on the door, ship&#39;s mast suspended over the dark wooden bar — but the real appeal is the way such a large bar manages to feel cozy rather than cavernous. Perhaps it&#39;s because the place is broken up into three rooms, two with full bars, plus a patio. (We counted no fewer than 19 TVs.) The food on offer — potato skins, burgers, a $13.50 steak — is strictly to soak up the booze, not show off anyone&#39;s skill in the kitchen. That means that if you order the \&quot;Calorie Counter,\&quot; you won&#39;t get kale but rather a hamburger patty with cottage cheese on the side. It&#39;s hard to imagine anything has changed here since 1983. There are even ashtrays on the patio. That&#39;s something you <i>really</i> don&#39;t see every day. —Sarah Fenske</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Place to Drink on the Sand<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Beaches are great, but the ones in L.A. are missing one big thing — and we&#39;re not talking about warm water. (That&#39;s for wusses.) No, the appalling lack of booze on our beaches is something a place like Miami would never put up with. In fact, to our knowledge, the only place in Los Angeles where you can drink with your feet in the sand is <b>Paradise Cove Beach Cafe</b>. Yes, when the wind is coming from the wrong direction, it smells a bit like a sewer. And yes, it is a bit of a shitshow; come too late in the day on a sunny weekend and even the valet is often all out of spaces. But if you manage to ditch your car and push through the mobs of tourists eating inside, you&#39;ll find a small bar outside where you can order from a limited menu and (here&#39;s the key) get a bottle of wine or beer to take with you to your beach towel. Forget the annoyance of trying to get here. Forget the fact you just used a valet at the beach. It really doesn&#39;t get any better than this. —Sarah Fenske</p>

Seven nights a week you&#39;re in luck if you fancy a sing-along, everything from Elton John&#39;s \&quot;Tiny Dancer\&quot; to New Orleans­–style, blues-tinged rock &amp; roll. Pianists Rick Solem, Doug Lacy (who played in Oingo Boingo) and Reseda Mickey, along with keyboardist Mate Carich, will keep you entertained with a wide range of their own selections while also taking your requests. And, heck, if you feel like giving an impromptu performance yourself, Mickey encourages vocalists to get up and sing right along with her. Friendly, laid-back and casual, with live music from 8:30 p.m. to 1:45 a.m., it&#39;s exactly the kind of neighborhood gem that can guarantee a fun night with friends. —Pamela Chelin</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Tequila Bar<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>When beverage director Jason Eisner was asked to create an agave-only spirits program from the ground up at <b>Gracias Madre</b>, he jumped at the chance. The result is a bar, specifically a mezcaleria, that features more than 100 agave — and only agave — spirits, from tequila to mezcal to <i>sotol</i>. Rather than simply going the usual route of margaritas, palomas and spicy/muddled concoctions, the cocktails here range from serious to whimsical. The Build Your Own Old-Fashioned offers your choice of tequila or mezcal and house-made bitters; both La Quinceañera and the Blueberry Mezcal Mojito are served as snow cones. The term \&quot;tequila bar\&quot; may conjure up a dive-y hideaway or a bustling joint with blaring house music, but here the environment is mellow, whether at the cool-to-the-touch, wrap-around stone bar, the breezy, whitewashed dining room, or the tree-dotted patio. —Lesley Jacobs Solmonson</p>

Though only a year old, it has been attended by such stars as Mick Jagger, Diddy, Billy Idol and Leonardo DiCaprio.

The hotel's watering hole, <b>Pot Lobby Bar</b>, is basically a super club masquerading as a cocktail spot. The hip-hop is loud, and the semicircular bar is swamped with thirsty night people.

But that&#39;s not to say that some customs won&#39;t survive in a hybrid, Angeleno way. At Koreatown&#39;s <b>Cindy Club</b>, a new owner has cleaned up the place and revived the tradition of \&quot;booking,\&quot; which involves a man asking a woman to join him at his table to share some alcohol. Booking is not mandatory, however, and there&#39;s plenty of karaoke and revelry to be had for Silver Lake hipsters and anyone else who wants to show up.

Since Carnage Asada cellist Dave Travis opened the Cypress Park bar in October last year, it has quickly turned into one of the city&#39;s best live-music venues. The small, homey room has a dive-y ambiance, what with its low, white stucco ceiling offset by a scuffed checkerboard floor, strands of Christmas lights and posters of Big Boys and Meat Puppets. Travis books the type of adventurous punk, jazz, stoner rock, metal and improvisational bands that would have played at Raji&#39;s, Al&#39;s Bar, the Cathay de Grande or, going further back, the Hong Kong Café and the Starwood.

Calling itself \&quot;the world&#39;s largest gin bar,\&quot; this drinkery and restaurant features a vast collection of gin sourced from all around the world, and even some in-house varieties produced with locally grown ingredients, such as wild sage and rosemary. \&quot;We have a gin for every taste,\&quot; says Brady Caverly, who co-owns the Proper with his wife, Mary Elizabeth. Customers who would like to sample multiple kinds of gin can choose from the Proper&#39;s \&quot;flights,\&quot; which include three 0.75-ounce tastings. (The popular Bartenders&#39; Favorite, for $15, includes choices picked by the staff.) Under chef Kevin Napier, the Proper also has an extensive food menu, highlighted by its popular chicken pot pies and burgers. —Chris Walker</p>

It helps that the Little Tokyo watering hole has an amazing selection of Japanese whiskeys and other craft spirits, a long list of mostly California beers and some really tasty, highball-style cocktails.

The walls are toothpaste-white, the shelves crammed with Tums next to bath powders that bring good luck, and the, er, pharmacists will answer your questions about black and white energy as calmly as if debating the difference between aspirin and ibuprofen. Plenty of shops sell <i>santería</i> candles — hell, you can buy one at Jons.

She took the opportunity to turn her unique idea into reality with the help of her partner and mother, Nana Kucheki, opening <b>Mr. Nail Lounge</b> in West Hollywood in April. The SoCal natives didn&#39;t want to open just another nail salon.

The clients are a healthy mix of regulars and first-timers whose girlfriends and wives decided to treat them to a special experience, without subjecting them to the uneasy vibes and judgmental stares of female customers at traditional nail salons.

For one, it&#39;s right across the street from the King Eddy Saloon, one of his favorite haunts. More than that, however, the location in the very heart of what remains of L.A.&#39;s Skid Row allows you to watch a sort of living movie while you get inked.

The clothing company has been around for 30 years, hiding out for much of that time in a gorgeous building downtown. Three open levels house a showroom, an office space and a sewing/production area. In an age when most of our clothing is made on another continent, it&#39;s inspiring to buy clothes in the showroom and then visit the women who made them — many of whom are wearing dosa themselves. Designer Christina Kim produces pieces that are simple yet ornate — think cotton and silk pajama pants paired with flowing dresses and embroidered tunics. Despite celebrity clientele including Alice Waters (who collaborated with Kim on her own collection) and pop-ups at fine-arts institutions like the Santa Monica Museum of Art, dosa&#39;s high price point and lack of advertising keep it under the radar — which is where it likes to be (the brand is so exclusive, Kim declined to be interviewed by <i>L.A. Weekly</i>). Access to the downtown showroom is by appointment only, but big sales several times a year are typically announced on Facebook — once you&#39;re in, get on the mailing list to be invited to future sales. Just don&#39;t tell anyone we told you. —Sascha Bos</p>

There&#39;s also a case filled with high-end glass crafted by artists who turn pipes into ducks, robots and other colorful characters. These sculptural pieces can cost well over $1,000 and are almost too beautiful to use. Next door to the Reseda shop is the associated Heady Gallery, open for exhibitions by the best artists in the scene.

<b>Title:</b> Best Bar with Comedy<br>
<b>body:</b> If you’re looking for a spontaneous comedy night, <b>the Virgil </b>is an easy go-to spot. It’s not like, say, Upright Citizens Brigade, where you have to get tickets ahead of time. The schedule is anchored by weekly comedy show Hot Tub with Kurt Braunohler and Kristen Schaal, but there are lots of oddball entries, such as the monthly variety show <i>Victory Lap</i> and the aptly titled <i>Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction</i>. The space used to be Little Temple but got a 2012 rebranding from Temple Bar Concepts, which also owns Townhouse and the Del Monte Speakeasy in Venice. The stage curtains and the curved banquettes give a classy, nostalgic vibe, but the space is loose enough that you can hover in the back (or sit at the bar) if you’re alone. Not a comedy fan? The Virgil often hosts live music and DJs. Or you can sit in the bar’s more intimate “B Side” and enjoy happy hour, with $8 craft cocktails, from 7 to 9 p.m. nightly and all night on Tuesdays. —Zachary Pincus-Roth

<b>Title:</b> Best Cabaret Night<br>
<b>body:</b> If you’re jealous of your New York friends for getting all the good new musical theater, you’ll feel at home at <b>A Little New Music</b>. The quarterly series is a cabaret show of new musical theater songs by everyone from up-and-comers to the Broadway songwriting team Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and the performers have included Broadway vets Kevin Chamberlin and Daisy Eagan. The lineup is eclectic — one song may be more of an experiment, while another may have been part of a recent show at Center Theatre Group. It’s been presented at Rockwell Table &amp; Stage, a low-lit restaurant that hosts cabaret-style entertainment seven nights a week (Jeff Goldblum sings every Wednesday). The space is comfortable and classy, though you’ll want to plan ahead and make a reservation to ensure you can sit with your friends. You’ll get a full evening that’s often more entertaining than seeing an actual musical — plus you can buy drinks and dinner. Interested in being part of A Little New Music? Feel free to submit your song or headshot via the website, though the producers receive way more than they can accept. —Zachary Pincus-Roth

<b>body:</b> <p>Dog \"life coach\" Tamar Geller's kennel, <b>the Loved Dog</b>, isn&#39;t so much doggie daycare as an awesome house party that your dog wishes he could go to every day. Here, Geller separates dogs based on temperament — mellow dogs upstairs in the 1,800-square-foot \&quot;lounge,\&quot; hyper dogs downstairs in the 2,600-square-foot \&quot;play park.\&quot; Within each area, dogs sort themselves out based on a pack hierarchy, though handlers will intervene if anyone steps out of line. Geller does not believe in pain or punishment but rather in happy, loving positive reinforcement. A cage-free kennel was a revolutionary idea when Geller first came up with it, back in 1996. A former intelligence officer with Israel&#39;s elite Special Forces, she fought long and hard to get the city to approve the concept. Similar facilities now are everywhere, but the original is still the best. —Gendy Alimurung</p>

You&#39;ll sweep upstairs on its grand staircase set in a towering, six-story lobby dripping with chandeliers, gold leaf and silk damask. You&#39;ll explore the glass-ceilinged ballroom downstairs, styled after a ship&#39;s lounge. And we know it sounds crazy, but surely some of the flourishes on the auditorium ceiling are sculpted from red velvet cake? Tickets for the Last Remaining Seats go on sale in April at $20, and the series — which also involves other historic movie palaces — sells out. —Jill Stewart</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Art-House Screenings in an Art-House Desert<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>South Bay cinephiles, rejoice: It's now possible to see independent movies without driving to the Westside. Bringing world cinema to Torrance's AMC Rolling Hills for more than two years now, the <b>South Bay Film Society</b> is a case study in art-house/multiplex convergence. Nearly every one of its one-off screenings sells out with the speed of a Beyoncé concert; in some cases, SBFS has had to add book additional screens to accommodate demand. Though most of these films only make it to Torrance after their initial runs in West L.A. and Santa Monica, the org is proving increasingly essential by hosting the local premieres of films such as <i>Burning Bush</i>, Agnieszka Holland&#39;s four-hour miniseries about self-immolation in Prague. \&quot;The South Bay has a large, well-educated population,\&quot; says curator Randy Berler, \&quot;and it made no sense to me that foreign films and many excellent independent films never come to this area.\&quot; Here, here. —Michael Nordine</p>

This desert, hidden at the side of the <b>801 Tower</b>, is one of the more Southern California–inspired spaces decreed by the 1 percent development mandate, which has helped create sculptures, statues and public parks all over downtown. Inspired by the Zanja Madre, L.A.&#39;s original water source for the pueblo, Andrew Leicester&#39;s design features desert mosaics, a compact garden of cacti, paradise-flowering pear and cypress, and a stylized pyramid fountain with an arrowhead on top. You enter through winglike gates alongside lanternlike towers, and can catch humanoid figures and the odd lizard, snake, beetle and goat skull lining the walls and benches.

<b>Title:</b> Best Museum to Channel Bruce Lee<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>If you've ever practiced any form of martial arts, or merely had an infatuation with overdubbed '60s kung fu movies, the <b>Martial Arts History Museum</b> surely will make an impression. Opened in Burbank in 2011, it is the first museum in the world to focus on the history of martial arts as a whole, rather than on one specific discipline, such as karate, judo or taekwondo. The place is full of compelling and colorful exhibits, which break down each individual martial art by the country that practiced it, plus fascinating examples of authentic weaponry and wardrobe and an informative timeline. A room devoted to martial arts in pop culture nicely ties in our American obsession through films, TV shows, comics, songs and cartoons.

<b>Title:</b> Best Gallery Off the Beaten Path<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>While most new contemporary art galleries in L.A. have been opening near other galleries in Culver City, Hollywood or downtown, Michelle Papillion opened hers on a block of Leimert Park with no galleries on it. She believes in the neighborhood and the artists working nearby. There's a \"vibe,\" she says, a young creative community waiting to be activated. Her white-walled storefront was built at the end of the 1920s and has been a gallery twice before, first in the late 1960s, right after the Watts riots, when Leimert Park became known as a black cultural center, and later around 2010, when arts patron Eileen Norton briefly hosted exhibitions there. But even when Norton occupied the space, Leimert remained segregated from the L.A. art world at large. <b>Papillion</b>&#39;s first few months of programming have been an attempt to change that while still keeping the neighborhood in the loop. Her May show, paintings by artist Noah Davis, was dark but still down-to-earth. The gallery&#39;s summer video residency, featuring a different video artist each week, worked to make a typically difficult medium accessible. Openings have been packed. —Catherine Wagley</p>

Housed inside the tony hotel, and opened in 2013, the <b>Morrison Hotel Gallery</b> exhibits works by Jim Marshall, Bob Gruen, Mick Rock, Henry Diltz and other well-known photographers — some you&#39;ve been staring at since you were a kid, from the cover of The Beatles&#39; <i>Sgt.

With another location in New York, the gallery was co-founded by former record executive Peter Blachley, music industry professional Richard Horowitz and Diltz, the official photographer for the Monterey Pop and Woodstock festivals and the man behind other notable album covers, including The Doors' <i>Morrison Hotel</i> and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#39;s self-titled debut record. —Siran Babayan</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best San Fernando Valley Arts Organization<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Arts organizer Addy Gonzalez and photographer Erin Stone started <b>11:11 A Creative Collective</b> in 2009 after looking around a Hollywood gallery opening and realizing everyone there — attendees, artists, musicians — was from the Valley. Since then, the collective has been the nexus of an artistic groundswell in the San Fernando Valley. Currently housed in a lofty Tarzana gallery space, its monthly group shows have explored public art, pop surrealism and light and motion. A recent exhibition co-curated by downtown&#39;s Cannibal Flower drew gallery prowlers upstream (north on the 405) to see emerging Valley artists alongside their fellow Los Angeles County contemporaries. But 11:11 is committed to flooding the Valley with art beyond its gallery walls — it has organized art walks in Canoga Park and Topanga and brought murals to North Hollywood and Reseda through the \&quot;Fill in the Blank Project,\&quot; which connects local muralists with business owners. Oh yeah, and Mayor Garcetti has Instagrammed them. —Jessica Langlois</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Historical Photo Collection<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>In a world where too many people think their every moment is essential to share online, it's worth stepping back in time to when photographs weren't instant and told more important, mysterious stories than Instagram ever will. <b>The Photo Friends</b> is a volunteer nonprofit organization that preserves and promotes the 70,000-photo collection of the L.A. Public Library, chronicling the history of the City of Angels from 1880 to today. It&#39;s available online, of course, but leave the laptop and come to the History &amp; Genealogy Department at the Central Library, where past exhibits have covered topics including California lifestyle, Hollywood scandals, prewar history and visits by Kennedy and King — all in glorious black-and-white and all worth the face time. —James Bartlett</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Startup Fine Art Print Studio<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Housed in a trellis-lined converted garage at the end of a residential cul-de-sac in Woodland Hills, <b>Valley Print Studio</b> is introducing a new culture of printing workshops to the San Fernando Valley. Recent Cal State Northridge graduate Miles Lewis, son of chamber musician Paula Hochhalter and actor Geoffrey Lewis, founded the studio with Zeina Baltagi in 2013. Lewis is tapping into the Angeleno tradition of residential arts spaces and giving community members access to intaglio presses, letterpresses and screen printing and paper-making equipment, so that they don&#39;t have to drive over the hill or pay for a course at an atelier or university. A partner of the creative collective 11:11, the studio offers three-hour workshops on specialized practices such as Coptic bookbinding and cyanotype photography for about 30 bucks and just hosted its first artist-in-residence from Chicago. Not bad for a backyard operation. —Jessica Langlois</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Freeway Interchange<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>Architecture critic Reyner Banham once wrote, \"The language of design, architecture and urbanism in Los Angeles is the language of movement. Mobility outweighs monumentality there to a unique degree.\" If you buy that argument, it would follow that our freeways and freeway interchanges should be considered among our greatest landmarks. Take for example the <b>carpool lane of the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange</b>, which connects the 110 and the 105: More than 130 feet high, it offers drivers a breathtaking view of sprawling, almost oppressively flat South Los Angeles, albeit one that must be viewed quickly to avoid careening off the side. The interchange is named for the New Deal–style, 90-year-old, still-serving activist judge who forced Caltrans into providing housing, jobs and other services to those living in the shadow of the 105, the last freeway built in L.A. Unfortunately, this majestic byway is now a toll lane, which means you need a special transponder from Metro to ride it. —Hillel Aron</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Multiplex<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>In the far West Valley, where suburbia revels in itself and the schools are all great, hidden at the back of an open-air mall you'll find the most uncrowded, service-oriented multiplex in town, <b>AMC Fallbrook 7</b> in West Hills. Sold to AMC by the Laemmle family last year, the most winning aspects of its $5 million renovation are the wonderful digital quality and the enormous, soft, red-leather recliners. You pick your seat from a screen just as you&#39;d do at ArcLight — but at AMC prices. Then you sink into your recliner, where your silent electronic button lets you move from upright to nearly flat, your legs lolling around like they&#39;re taking separate vacations. The doublewide padded armrests provide a mini-table for your hot dog and Junior Mints, and the rows are so spacious you don&#39;t need to move an inch to let people pass. Then the movie gets under way — and you hear the crowd laughing or gasping yet feel wonderfully alone. —Jill Stewart</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Indie Movie Theater<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>There's always something good playing at the <b>Sundance Sunset Cinema</b>, at least if you&#39;re a grown-up. Bucking the PG-13 trend that&#39;s dominating most multiplexes, the theater has a strict 21-and-older policy, with movies to match. Why the age limit? So you can bring a glass of beer or wine into the theater, rest it on the side table next to your reclining seat and enjoy your choice of flick from among five well-curated screens like a goddamned adult. Show up after 4 p.m. when the kitchen opens, and add on a made-to-order lobster roll or gourmet pizza. Like the festival that shares its name, the Sundance specializes in indie and foreign fare, so odds are you&#39;ll leave feeling smarter than when you entered (if you limit yourself to one bottle of wine per person, that is). And if you&#39;ve got highbrow tastes but a low balance in your checking account, on Tuesdays tickets are just $5. —Amy Nicholson</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Bet for Ballsy Original Plays<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>If you&#39;re looking for a sure-fire retread of a recent New York–anointed stage hit or a comforting reboot of a canonical classic, do not drive out to Atwater Village and lay your money down at <b>Echo Theater Company</b>. Producing artistic director Chris Fields and managing artistic director Drew Dalzell didn&#39;t become the city&#39;s premier producers of dark and daring new work from emerging playwrights by playing short-odds favorites. Rather, they&#39;ve perfected unerring early-warning artistic radar for identifying tomorrow&#39;s Theresa Rebeck or Stephen Adly Guirgis or Suzan-Lori Parks or Will Eno before they get too agented up and unaffordable for 99-seat economies. Echo&#39;s acumen for matching state-of-the-art writing with top-of-their-game actors has already resulted in acclaimed and ballsy world premieres by Matthew Benjamin &amp; Logan Brown, Padraic Duffy , Gary Lennon , Mickey Birnbaum and Tommy Smith. This season they&#39;re readying another new play from Smith (writer of this year&#39;s acclaimed pedophilic-romance play <i>Firemen</i>) as well as from Houston-based comer Miki Johnson, and are promising more. —Bill Raden</p>

<b>Title:</b> Best BBQ Not Made by Kevin Bludsoe<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>For years, Robert Earl has been mesquite-smoking his meats in a hand-welded, four-barrel cooker hitched to the back of a miniature ice cream truck, which doubles as a catering van. On the back, a painted warning says, \"BBQ so good make you slap mama.\" Maybe so, when you're talking about Earl's pork ribs and beef brisket so tender it can't even hold its sliced shape. The homemade cooker spends most of its time heating the daily offerings in the parking lot behind Earl's year-old namesake restaurant in North Long Beach, <b>Robert Earl's BBQ</b>, where ribs, pulled pork and brisket have been added to the long list of sinful specialties and his wife&#39;s vegetarian sides (you&#39;d swear there was bacon grease in the greens) come included with most meals. So skip the lines at Bludso&#39;s and, in addition to competition-worthy, Texas-style BBQ, you&#39;ll be rewarded with the option of wolfing down one of Robert Earl Jr.&#39;s signature \&quot;golden nugget\&quot; desserts: a scoop of banana pudding atop a pan-fried piece of cornbread. —Sarah Bennett</p>

At this small Monterey Park diner, it&#39;s all about the congee. Long lines for rice porridge?

<b>Title:</b> Best Restaurant<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>It’s a brilliant thing chef Ludo Lefebvre and partners Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo have done at <b>Trois Mec</b>: They’ve managed to make dining at the highest level fun again. How? By stripping away most of what’s intimidating about fancy restaurants. Step through the doors of what used to be a Raffallo’s Pizza, and the loud music and intimate setting make Trois Mec feel more like a friend’s house than a stuffy eatery. They’ve also taken away the stressful financial burden most world-class restaurants inspire: a ticketing system means you’ve already paid for your meal and the only real damage you can do is with the wine list. And that $100 or so you’ve already spent on dinner is a bargain for Trois Mec’s greatest achievement, which is the food. The five-course meal is as surprising as it is delightful, with heartfelt odes to the seasons, clever uses of ingredients that are far more delicious than you’d expect (mustard crème brûlée, anyone?), and elements that you never thought could be so alluring. You might come away having given your heart to a charred cabbage leaf, or some pulped potato. Didn’t see that coming, did you? —Besha Rodell</p><p>

<b>Title:</b> Best Kaiseki<br>
<b>body:</b> <p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> recently featured chef Niki Nakayama and her restaurant <b>n/naka</b> in a lengthy profile, claiming she may be the only female kaiseki chef in the world. She may also be the only chef in L.A. doing proper kaiseki, the formal, paced Japanese tasting menus based around the seasons. Individual dishes here are some of the most visually stunning in the city, but there’s a careful artistry to them rather than cute gimmicks. In fact, there may be no other chef around who sublimates her ego so completely to her ingredients. It’s as if Nakayama knows the secret language of the pristine vegetables and seafood she’s using, and they whisper quiet inspiration to her. The courses are divided into different ruminations: a pairing of something common with something unique; a modern interpretation of sashimi; traditional sashimi; a steamed dish; a chef’s-choice dish not bound by tradition. You’re going to have to shell out for the honor of dining here — the 13-course kaiseki costs $165 — but rest assured it will be the meal of a lifetime. —Besha Rodell</p><p>
