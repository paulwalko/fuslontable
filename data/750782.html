<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Brite orange glowing object passed overhead. At 12:30am on july 30 1997 while watching a meteor shower on the shore of Cutfoot Sioux I observed a object that appearied in the south east sky. At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air) . This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second. The craft passed overhead at about 10, 000 feet. As the craft disapiered into the trees behind the campsite I heared the slight roaring sound of jet engines. Flight path was from the south east to the north west. No sonic booms. are we test aircraft that can fly after entering atmospher?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 20-35 triangular shaped craft sighting. Bright flashing lights at corners. 13 yr old male 43 yr old female-Masters Degree (No previous sightings) 13 yr old spotted bright light in east from interiorof the home. Went to investigate and then saw a large object in the eastern sky. He called his mother who also went to investigate. The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen. It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon. The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners. When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside. It hovered for a while and then was approached by another smaller craft. The large one began to turn north west and the smaller craft followed. The craft abruptly turned and went due north. Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north. They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals. It took them less than two minutes to go from horizon to horizon. We had never seen any craft move that quickly. Many of them maneuvered in distint manners:forward-reverse, forward-reverse; hover; very quick zigzag; 45+ degree banks in a matter of seconds: almost as if a display. Light pattern: one light on one wing would flashand then the other two would follow. Colors of the lights were white in front, blue and redon the sides and smaller amber to red on the inside of the triangle, making a perfect equilateral triangle inside the craft perimeter. Sound: At first like a plane, but then a high pitched hum could be heard particularly when the craft was right over us. A while afterwards, almost like blowing over the top of a tube. More than 20-35 of these were seen over the course of approximately 45 minutes, traveling from thesouth, some going northwest, some northeast, and some traveling directly overhead to the north.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> An orange "shooting star" in the SSE area of the sky. This object was very orange. I'd never seen an object this orange, and it fizzled, throwing off sparks as it fell. It ended with a visual "poof. " It was like a pop-bottle rocket in reverse. I saw this driving home from work. I can easily believe it was just a piece of meteor or space junk that got unusually close to the earth to flame and spark so much. Most other shooting stars I've seen have been white and made a thin white line as they've streaked across the sky. This seemed to have a more downward motion to the earth. I wouldn't report it other than the fact that I heard Peter's report on the Art Bell show, and was wondering if the sighting in Chicago occurred at this time. I didn't catch the day or time of the sighting. If this seems to fit the description of a regular falling star, then I apologize for having taken your time. It's just that I'd never seen a shooting star this orange. Thanks. BTW, I work as a copy editor at a daily newspaper here in the Twin Cities and am skeptical-to-open about UFOs, etc.<br>

My wife and I were heading home from Duluth Minnesota, south on interstate 35 on Feb. 8th 1997 at dusk, the sun was setting but there was still some light. About 2 miles north of Stacy Minnesota (North of Wyoming Minnesota) My wife said, look it's going to crash! I looked out side window of the truck, and seen this . . . . I don't know what it was, it had 5 or more strobe lights lighting up one at a time around the perimeter of the object. I coundn't make out the shape because it was dusk, but I could see something. The "craft" came towards the ground at a steep angle and pulled up at the last second and went up. . up. . up. We watched for what seemed to be about a minute, I never did stop or pull off the freeway, I was just so amazed I didn't think of stopping! The freeway runs parallel with state highway 61, the two roads are about 1/4 mile apart where we seen it, so it must have been about half way between interstate 35 and state hwy 61, about 1/8 mile from our truck. The freeway had alot of traffic, some one else had to see this, who would be playing in plane at this time of the evening, in the winter ? I thought plane only had one or two lights? I am only reporting this now because I have just learned about you and I am a big ufo secptic, but I also learned about a week later my in-laws, who winter in Phenoix, seen something really strang in march, which made the news.

<b>DURATION:</b>  5 secs<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I glanced skyward and saw an object moving extremely quickly across the night sky. It appeared as two points of light, seperated but traveling uniformly. The object materialized, traveled very quickly on a straight path, then disappeared. I confess that the object was quite faint. The object was two points of light, seperated by just a degree or so. The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness. The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared. The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology. I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine. I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual "streak" as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A firery ball came from a high altitude at a steep angle in the northern sky. It leveled off and changed to a dome shape with a pulsating red light on top. A white light glowed underneath as it flew level in a NW direction. I am a private pilot (at age 16) with USAF pilot training in T-37 jet. Three of us saw a fire ball enter the atmosphere at a steep angle. It was trailing red fire as it came down at high speed. It leveled off at a few thousand feet and became a dome (lampshade) shape with a pulsating red light on top and a yellowish-white light shining below. It was several miles to the north so we had a side view as it leveled off and slowed way down. It was moving in a westerly direction at approximately two or three thousand feet. It made no sound and the sky was clear and very dark. It got smaller as it flew to- ward the west at several hundred miles per hour. We lost sight after two minutes when it was hidden by the trees on the horizon.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  60+ seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Various colored lights flashing after power surge &amp; failurePower surge/failure occured at 7:30 pm. Lights went off but glowed hazy green for several seconds before immense lights began to flash over the foggy sky - central location of flashes from us was WNW. The first flash was a general bright blue followed by several defined rays that spread out from the circumference of the blue lights this was followed by more flashing - yellow and red lines that horizontally crossed the original set of rays. The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29. 90. We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth. It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap. We walked over to the site of the break later and saw several power company vehicles a couple of squad cars were present but left before we actually reached the scene.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Something floated by me, no sound, no wind!Of course everyone asked what i was on, nothing iv'e only told 4-5 people this. Warm summer night, clear skies no wind at all. I was bringing out the garbage out to the ally no one was around, dead quite. I lived on a corner lot at the time so I could see two blocks in either direction. iwas looking up and around at the stars when standing east I caught something in the corner of my eye. About a block to my right five or ten feet over the tree tops which were around tweny five to thirty feet up was this thing. It floated in a absulute straight line past me vary slow 2-3 miles per hour, I was about five feet from the ally. It was lightly ulluminated in a yellowish color, with a black corner to corner stripe about 1. 5-2 feet wide. The thing was about the size of a vw bug. There were no edges, seems or anything protruding from it. Ten or so feet long six or so feet wide. The closest thing I can come up with is the movie of Star Trek were they put spock into a cascate and sent him to some planet. Its shape was quit quite simular. I heard no sound from it, no trafic anyware at all, this was on a Sunday night. I watched it go past me straight down the ally and out of site. Istood the wondering what the hell was that, nothing can do that. I looked around to see if maybe someone else was around but nobody was there. I don't know what it was, I do remember I had An erie sense about it. Has anyone else seen this? I know it's weird but the more i've thought of this thing for the past seven years, I have a strange feeling it was some sort of probe, crazy huh. Well thats about it thanks for listening.<br>

In the early morning on a winter day when I was younger, my friends and I had a sleep over, and one of my friends had a paper route, so we were out probally at 4:00 AM and this triangular object was suddenly noticed above us. It was very hard to distinguish the border around the object, even though it was very low, and large. There were lights on each corner, or what looked to be the corners. and it was a bigger light like the color of the moon, and there was another light within the light that moved in a circle inside the big light. The friend with the paper route was the only one that didn't see it. becasue he was doing his route, but the other five of us saw it, and were very traumatized. . . and immediately ran back to the house.<br>

I looked up and thought I saw the fuselage of an airplane to the south. But as I looked more intently I realized it was not moving but remained stationary. And then within a few seconds it sped of at an incredible speed and disappeared. This is very similar to what I had seen a couple years previous. Also the next night Me and a friend of mine returning from byron, mn to rochester saw something green break up very close to the ground. believe it was a meteor or space junk?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Boating on Lake Minnetonka in MN on warm summer night, skies clear, fireball appeared travelling from East to West at about 60 degrees from the Zenith. Fireball appeared to cross the sky from East to West. A booming sound was heard, but it was muffled. The fireball started out as yellow, then turned orange, with a green tail spreading out about the width of a full moon. The green color dissapated slowly and appeared to phosphoresce as it faded. Total time streaking across the sky was about 6 seconds. The phosphorescence lasted an additonal 4-5 seconds. I tried to get the attention of the other boater before it faded, but, insofar as he was turned northward, and the object was at about 60 degrees up in the Southern sky, he did not turn and focus in time to see the whole thing. The boat engine did sputter and almost quit when the object crossed the sky, but ran o. k. thereafter.<br>

We were at about 15 thousand feet. It was about 15 minutes to 6 am. We were over minneapolis. The object was perfectly round and just sitting out there. It seemed to glow sporadically on one side. The lights went from bright white, to a greenish and a very faint orange. I observed it for about a minute but as we began our decent down through the clouds I lost sight of it. I did not tell anybody, and I dont believe anybody on the northwest flight saw it (as they were asleep) but I dont see how the pilots could miss it.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright green fireball with long tail seen plummetting from overhead towards the Northwest. Seemed to fall to earth, and not continue over the horizion. Very bright, below overcast cieling. On November 4, 1998 at approximately 8:30pm CST while getting in a car with a friend, I noticed from overhead, a brilliant green fireball streaking downward, and towards the northwest at high speeds. It had a long tail, much like a comet, except it too was green. It was very low, beneath the overcast cieling, and seemed to fall to earth before it reached the horizion. I was surprised at how bright it was, because I could see it, despite the flourescent lights of a nearby gas station which was between me and the object. The sighting lasted for only one or two seconds, but it was definitely not a typical "shooting star".<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Iobserved an object changing colors and moving in a manner inconsistent with anything i've ever seen. I woke my wife and asked her to look out to the northwest. she saw the object too and advised me to report it to the local airport. It moved like a kite in the wind and changed from a light green to yellow-white, to red every few seconds. it gave the appearence of moving away from me and eventually faded from view. Using binoculars, I could dissern an oval shape tilted on its edge at a great distance from me, maybe 50 miles. I waited until it faded away behind the trees. the light source looked like a gas-filled oval tube on the object's edge. I WILL be watching again tonight. Ioriganally saw an object changing colors around 01;00 hrs but dismissed it as some kind of sattilite or maybe a planet reflecting light. I looked out again 1 hour later and saw it contnue to chane colors. I waited 20 minutes then went to wake up my wife. We both watched it from inside for about 1 hour. I called around until i got the phone number to report it. Afterwords went outside with binoculars to confirm my suspision. There were no other objects in the sky exhibiting the same color or movement. It appread to h0ver and dip in the same part of the sky until about 04;00.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw four silver colored (like when the sun shines on an airplane) capsuale shaped objects that were traveling east to west, very fast. They were traveling in a capsuale sitting vertical position as they moved from east to west. They evetually disappeared into the western horizon. Nothing Real dramatic in there apperance or movement other than they were moving very fast, and they were defintely not airplanes. First I saw one capsuale shaped object. It was silver color, like when the sun shines on an airplane. It was traveling from east to west. What really caught my attention was that this capsuale shaped object was traveling east to west with this capsuale shape positioned verticle. I was walking to my vehicle where my friend was waiting, still watching as I walked to my vehicle. My friend and I proceeded to watch and have a discussion about this object, and the possibilities of what it might be when I got in my vehicle. Meanwhile it had traveled closer to the horizon. Suddenly there where two more of same objects that are eyes had now been drawn too. They were almost at the edege of the horizon. They were traveling even with each other side by side. They were also traveling east to west like the first one. Which was sitll traveling in same direction towards the other 2 in the western horizin. They were all traveling very fast . What we both saw next Immediately Eliminated alot of the possibilities of what we thought these objects might be. It was another capsuale shaped object dropping straight down into our atmosphere. The reason I can say this with confidence is that it was sparking, and it was red hot in color. It appeared to then just stop moveing momentarilly. It cooled quickly as I saw it change color from this red hot look to the silver color like the other three. Once it changed to this silver color it started moving east to west in same direction as the other 3 objects. Same speed very fast in a straight east to west direction. We watched them all move straight from the east into the western horizon untill we lost site of all four as they dissapeared into horizin. I am a Tool and die maker. My friend is a printer. Im still currious as to what they might have been. They where definitely not airplanes.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 2 unmoving round objets side my side like eyes streight overhead above the fiew clouds that drifted under them. They did not move and I dont remember even looking at them the second time. they were white as the clouds but not metalic shining. I was very young like about only 4 years old at the time and I am 55 now this was one of the two times I was a wittness of UFOs. These objects did not move enough for me to notice. they were not like the weather balloons that were prevalant during those days but because these were right over head and not like the side view that the weather baloons were. None of the caricteristics below fit the objects that I observed. We were poor people that had to raise as much food as we could in the summer months to have enough food for the cold winters we have here. Mom was a mother of 8 and practicly alone in her indever to raise us. so we spent a lot of time in the large gardens we had at that time. For the most part we ignored the objects and went back to our task of hoeing the strawberry plants growing in that particular garden plot.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> UFO in morning sky. . . jets followingI was going to work that morning. I live in the country and I was going to drive into town to get to my work place. I was with a co-worker who lived on the way to town (we were car pooling) . The sky was clear and it was just a quiet morning. Then my co-worker pointed into the sky and said, "Look at that! What is that thing?" I am not an aircraft expert, but that thing didn't look like any aircraft I've ever seen. It was in a sort of oval shape, more like an egg. It was a dark gray color. There weren't any lights or anything like that. The object made no noise. It was about 1000 feet in the air and it was moving very fast across the sky. Then there was a jet aircraft chasing after it about three seconds after the craft passed. The jet made jet noises, unlike the craft. The craft didn't have any jet engines, but it was going so fast that it would almost have to. Both me and my co-worker didn't know what the craft was. We still don't to this day and we classify it as a UFO because that's what it is to us. I'm not going to give out my personal information because I don't know what people (people with the jet aircraft) will do to me if they see this story.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> stargazers looking at a beautiful sky full of stars on a perfectly clear night, wittness several craft buzzing over Cross lake. One craft approached and observed the group shined lights on us, windows appeared and we were able to see two creatures gazing at us. A group of five people were star gazing on a beautiful clear Minnisota night, after 15-20 minutes of sky watching, we noticed a cloud cover converging over the lake from the left and the right (simultaniously) we thought this strange since clouds seem to usually come from one direction We were sitting lake level at a friends farm (away from it all, out of town on dirt roads the farm house itself was about 50 yards away) , we were at the boat landing area and talking and visiting. Earlier we had commented on the sounds of the night, crickits, frogs, dogs night birds etc. As the clouds closed up the entire view of the sky, we noticed a dim light which appeared to be about 20 yards out on the lake. The only thing I could think of that this might be was someone night fishing with a lantern or some kind of light source in a rowboat with that source being below the rim of the boat, thus giving of a weird glow. We could make no lines out so we had no idea of shape or distance, out in the country on a lake it gets very very dark. It was myself and 4 lady friends there that night, heres where it gets strange. From the lenght of the light and the size of a row boat I figured it must be about 20 yards out, I called out, . . hey are you catching anything? No response . . I repeated myself again. . no response. While listening for a response I noticed that all of the night sounds had vanisher and there was no sounds at all, except. . . . the sound of a finely tuned engine , barely detectable, but every thing else seemed oddly still. Since there was no response and knowing a person would usually respond to a call out, I picked up my flashlight a shinned it toward the light. . . it illuminated nothing, thats strange, I decided to walk up the hill towards the farm and get an elevated view. Walking up the incline with the 4 girls close behind. (inches) I got a veiw of a good portion of this good sized lake, to my surprise ai saw 4 other light buzzing around the lake also at a foot or two above the water it seemed. I turned to the girls and asked them if they saw what I saw and they said what do you see? Anyway we all saw these lights moving around on the lake. By this time the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. We ruled out all possibilities except UFO'S. As we stood there with our jaws dropped the light that we had first thought to be a fishing boat, began to levitate to our eye level, about 30 feet above water level. Now I always said if I had an encounter, I would make friends, forget it, as the light followed us up the hill to the stairs of the farmhouse I along with the girls were fearful of the light. My friends family was sleeping in the house (father and grandmother) we noticed that the trusty dog that lives on the front steps that was there earlier was gone, we were there to camp by the lake and were set up there. I didn't want to go into the farmhouse out of respect, and I still was in a state of disbelief over all this trying to convince myself it wasn't happining. So I told the girls , lets just sit on the steps for a moment and see what happens. The length of yard was about 35 feet before a small 20 foot incline down to the shore, we sat down, the light now out over the water directly in front of us glowing like a light with a dimmer on it at a very low level. We sat in disbelief as the light at once became brighter, we could now make out some kind of shape, it was like a coffee saucer was upside down, wider at the bottom than top, there appeared to be a pattern within that light (window) and that was like those iron grates you see on sidewalk accesses for sewer systems, kind of honey combed. Behind the grate and in front of the light source were two silhouett figures. I was unable to make out any features since it seemed the light source was behind them. They had triangular type bodies with the shoulders being the wide point, same with their heads shaped like drawings of Greys. These two seemed to be observing us, moving side to side, we were mesmerized. After a few minutes the light once again dimmed, this scared us enough to get inside the house. I decided it was time to wake up my friends father, I went into his bedroom and woke him saying that there were flying saucers outside, he'd been drinking and mumbled we must be on drugs and drifted back to sleep, I then tried Grandma . . same thing. I grabbed a shotgun out of the closet and went back to the kitchen with the girls who immediatley convinced me to put the gun away, that it would only make things worse if they felt provoked. . . I listened. We then not knowing what else we could do and driven be fear as well as curiosity we went back to the steps sat down and watched the low glowing light in front of us. We werent sure how big this thing was because as I stated it was dark out there and it was just a light and we couldn't see the whole thing, anyway after a minute the light got a bit brighter and from underneath three laser type lights popped on and started scanning very quickly the house the trees, us etc. The lights were straight beams about 6inchis acroos that were very strong and as I said in a laser type beam, it scanned everything in a very deliberate fasion this went on for mayby 15 seconds then the lights went out and the saucer lights also got very weak and we heard about 6 very loud splashes in the lake, I imagined that beings were jumping into the water (like frog men) and would be comming up over the hill any second, we all got very scared at the thought of this and ran back in the house to the upstaires, where the family had some extra beds for company. The upstairs was unfinnished, the farmhouse was over 100 years old and didn'y have a ceiling just the roof then a few wooden cross beams or rafters. this was a summer getaway and was not insulated upstairs. On the center beam going accross the ceiling there was an old ceramic light fixture with a bulb and a string to turn it on and off, there was an open window with a screen on it on one wall. We were all very frightened so told every one to pair up and take one of the three beds. This put us two to a bed all staring at the window. I said mayby it will just go away, we sat there for maybe 2 minutes which seemed like forever, then suddenly it got very bright above the house it seemed as if the sun were shinning we could see dust particles and light comming through cracks and nailholes and it was like daytime outside the window, then suddenly two little balls of light the size of say handballs came through the screen without making a hole! These things were circling around each other at a very fast rate, they zoomed around us and the room and went to the hanging light bulb fixture on the ceiling beam they seemed drawn to it for 5 seconds or so then thew swooshed back out the screen as fast as they had come. Two seconds later it was dark again. We all sat there virtually paralized! Soon I guess our senses came back and we could hear in the distance the sound of a car comming down the dirt road, the sound got closer and closer we heard the car pull into the long driveway and a car door slam (we realized it was my friend whos farm we were at that we had split up from earlier in the evening finally returning home) I ran to the window and saw it was our friend, I then shouted to him to stay there!! We all ran outside to save him! As we ran up the driveway to warn him we must have seemed histerical, trying to explain we looked around, the sky was clear , the night sounds back, the old trusty dog was back and it seemed like every thing was back to normal. The local town paper reported several people seeing funny lights and passed them off as meteors. NO WAY The next thing is I looked at my watch and noticed it was about 12:15 am, this started around 10:pm it didn't seem possible that 2 hours could have passed. . . maybe 21-30 minutes.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I was 5 years old at the time, family of 4 told they would remember nothing. I managed to break free of the (mind) control just before they left. Over the years there has been return visits by more than one type of being. One did not want for there activitys known by the other. At 10 years of age I was made to forget. When my son was 5 years later they returned and wanted to know about any activities with other aliens. They imployed mind control on both myself and my son, both of us broke from there control just before leaving the house with them, I was unable to move, but was able to tell my son to fight them, he kicked and punched two of the aliens near him. When hit they did not respond in any way? They seemed like puppets being controlled remotely, arms and legs of at least 6 (small greys) aliens move together (in sync) . When hit they went blank (stopped moving) . At this point I no longer felt fear, and they again had control of me. My son also remembers this encounter, only about 2 or 3 minutes. After that I only broke out 2 other times for very short periods of time. One: as they took me into there craft (a joke looked shabby) . two: laying down inside being interrogated. When 10 years old on the day I was told I would forget, I wrote what I knew down on paper, put it in jar, buried it behind our home and started a fire on top of it. Then I went a got the cattle for my dad too milk. This is were they said I would think of them for the last time. Coming back I was surprised by men in the woods putting out the fire that I started. At first I couldn't even remember that I set the fire. Years after I remembered I had started the fire and had buried something. I have looked but would need to dig up a space of around 30 sq feet.<br>

I was on the way home from work, and saw what i thought might be a meteor. but it was the wrong color (yellow) , and moving too slowly, and in the wrong direction (straight down, as opposed to horizontally) . It was a little larger than the other stars, and bright yellow, it was the movement and color that caught my eye. It dropped to a point in front of me, and about 45 deg from the horizon, stopped, then apparently divided into 4 sections (as it was just a point of light, i say apparently) , then each section made a bit of an s-curve away from each other, and departed in 4 different directions, roughly 90 deg from each other. At the time i thought it interesting, and didn't mention it to anyone. Could this be a ufo sighting? please resopnd via e-mail.<br>

The neighbors horses were running and rearing. I awoke everyone in the house so that they could see it. I was sure glad that it was still there. My family acted so srange. They were mad for being awoken. Everyone got extemely tired and went back to bed. I stayed up and watched it for as long as I could. I fell asleep at the window. I woke up before daylight and it was gone. Years later as an adult it haunts me. I saw the neighbor lady one time while taking the kids to visit my mom. I risked humiliation by telling her that I saw it. She lit up like a switch and told me that I was not crazy. [NUFORC Note: Time and date are approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> From 4:35 AM to 4:45 AM on 6/24/99, Minneapolis, MN 55454, on Washington Avenue ("7 Corners") , I saw in the north sky a bright white light like a small star moving very slowy from west to east very high in the sky. It passed in front of (underneath) a high white cloud and was clearly bright and visible even with the white cloud as background. It passed into the cloud and was not visible for less than a minute, then came out of the cloud and continued. About 7 minutes after I first started watching the light, it stopped in the sky, and stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes. While I was looking at it, it suddenly vanished - suddenly it just wasn't there any more. I looked all over the area of the sky but couldn't see a trace of it. Then I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it, but no one else was at the bus stop with me. At 4:30 AM on Thursday, 6/24/99 I was waiting for my bus at what is known as "7 Corners" on Washington Ave. in Minneapolis. I was sitting on the bus stop bench on the south side of the street, facing north. My bus wasn't due for about 15 minutes and I didn't have anything to read so I was just relaxing and looking around. It was early rush hour and traffic was pretty heavy. The sky was bright and blue with a few scattered high fluffy white clouds. I was sitting in the shade and wearing sunglasses, so I was looking around very comfortably. I was looking north (towards the Holiday Inn at 1500 Washington Ave.) , and at 4:35 AM I was enjoying the lovely sky and watching a couple of high clouds when I noticed a light moving very slowly from west to east across the north sky. It was very high up and I immediately thought "oh, a satellite" like I've seen on clear nights away from the city. It looked very much like a satellite, but a little bigger, like a small star - as bright, white, and clear as a star on a clear night. Then I realized it was broad daylight, and I wondered if it's possible to see a satellite (so bright and clear!) in the daylight. I watched it carefully, curious to make out what it was - but it was too far away - just a light like a moving star. As I watched it I looked at with and without my sunglasses, and it was clearly visible both ways. I'd been watching it cross the sky slowly from west to east for about 2 or 3 minutes when it came to a cloud. I expected to lose sight of it, but was surprised to be able to clearly see it with the cloud in the background. Even though it was a white light on a white cloud, it was bright enough to see clearly. Then it passed into the middle of the cloud and I lost sight of it for about 45 seconds. It came out of the cloud again and I continued to watch it move slowly east. Two or 3 minutes later it stopped. I wondered if it was changing direction and kept watching closely, but it just stayed still for at least 2 minutes. While it was! just sitting there in the sky, a bus passed in front of me, blocking it from view. I expected to lose sight of it, but after the bus passed by I could see the light clearly, still sitting in the same spot. About 1 minute later it vanished. I was looking at it, and then it was just not there anymore. I looked all over to see where it had gone, but I couldn't see a trace of it. I looked around to see if anybody else had seen it, but there was no one else at the bus stop. My bus came and as I rode, I kept watching the north sky for a couple more minutes but couldn't see it anywhere. I would really like to know if anyone else saw it and if anyone knows what it was!<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This seemingly craft has been hanging around here all summer! But tonight it came closer and we could see three lights in the shape of a triangle. It circled our house for awhile. It seemed to hide on the horizon and when I went outside to let the dog in from the backyard it came up towards me. I didn't hear a sound the whole time. We live right by the main international airport and we also live by the military base. Is this a new aircraft they are trying? It hovers! It sits in one place for a while (3 minutes, 15 minutes, hours. . . then with no warning it flys. It flys like an airplane, but I get the sense that it, or they can see me because it reacts to me when I go out of doors! Very strange! Have seen similar triangular lights following jet contrails in the sky throughout the summer! I pulled my husband out twice to look because I didn't want to think I was seeing something that could be explained away as a regular aircraft. The oddest thing about this experience was that there was no sound at all the whole time!<br>

They seemed to take turns in chasing each other. I thought at first it was a reflection from the plane but as the plane was flying I was having to look back to see them as the plane was flying away from them. They were much too fast and turning too quickly to be any kind of aircraft.<br>

It was gone behind my house before I could stand up to see where it went. I remember thinking, "Shit, that thing is moving fast!" I thought it might be a shooting star, but it was very bright, moved incredibly fast, and did not have a tail. It did not look like any other shooting stars I have ever seen.

(a farm family, 5 miles away from the nearest town) We watched the object continue slowly upward out the north window of our house. It then speed up and to the right before stopping. After sitting still for a minute or so, the main object got lighter as a small red object seperated and slowly moved to the east of the main object. Shortly after, another small red object moved off to the west, again making the main object lighter. The remaining part of the main object then moved off to the west. The final three objects looked the same, each having 2 points of red light. They moved slowly out of site. The events took 5 to 7 minutes to transpire.<br>

The center blocked out stars as it moved from West/NW to South/SEMY wife and I have a weekend cabin 18 miles from Detroit Lakes, MN. It is isolated from all city lights as it is located in the Minnesota lakes country. On Oct. 8th, 1999 at 11:15PM My wife and I were outside in the backyard looking for satelites and shooting stars. The sky was very clear. I first thought I saw a satelite, but noticed there were 3 lights moving in a triangle. I showed it to my wife to make sure she saw the same thing. They were moving at the speed and brightness of a satelite. It was fairly large and moving at a steady speed. The center of the three lights would block out background stars, as it moved from West/Northwest to South/Southeast. It is very quiet in the woods as we have no close neighbors. There was no sound at all, we can hear commercial airliners at very high altitudes when it is that still and quiet. After about 2 to 3 minutes the lights disappered. [NUFORC NOTE: These satellites may be U. S. Navy satellites, flying in formation. The same type of phenomenon was reported to us during August and September 1996, and Mr. Terence Dickinson, astronomy journalist for the Toronto (Canada) Star newspaper, apparently was able to identify their origin. ]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw 4 craft floating in the sky in and near the constellation Ursa Major. They remained there for quite some time and then sped off. I saw 4 craft at around 11:15 AM last night floating in the sky around the Big Dipper. They floated about rather slowly in circular patterns and one sped off almost immediately after I first saw them. The other three remained for nearly five hours and didn't really do much except float around. They remained in motion constantly (not much motion, but it was noticeable) all the time I watched. The craft themselves appeared to be rectangular or oval in shape and didn't appear to have three dimensions at all (i. e. , flat or something?) . They were primarily yellow, green and red in color, with two yellow bands (apparently glowing) on their "top" and "bottom, " running all the way across, from "front" to "back" on all four of them. In between the two yellow bands was a section of alternating red and green lights that appeared to either move or change colors in a regular pattern. I am a 19 year old student with an interest in the sciences (primarily physics and astronomy) . I don't really know what other information about me you want -- I'm not a "wacko" or mentally unstable or anything. Also: this isn't the first time I have seen these craft, either. I see them usually a few times a year, but never this many and never for this long, so I decided this was noteworthy. Thank you for your time.<br>

I noticed what at first I thought was a satalite moving across the sky. However, the object was not traveling in a straight line, and the intensity was growing brighter. Next the object stopped, this really got my attention. This did not behave like any conventional aircraft. I instructed my wife to not lose sight of the object as I ran to the car to get my binoculars. I returned and quickly regained view of object which had the appearence of a bright star. You would have to be looking for this as it was not easily noticeable. To my amazement the object began to move again, this time in a different direction. The object stopped again. Very shortly later it began to move again. Only this time it appeared to be moving out to space as it began to get dimmer and dimmer. I watched it dissapear with my binoculars. It did not dissapear over the horizen, it dissapeared out in to space until it was no longer visable. I was very impressed, much more then my wife.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A triangular craft w/3 lg orange lights silently flew overhead going west to east. It then sped up and away. My brother and I were changing a shifter in his car when our dog started going nuts. The dog ran up and down the driveway barking wildly, as he did only when someone was coming up the driveway. I ran out (we had the car parked over the old cellar steps) to see who was coming up the driveway, and saw that the dog was looking up. I looked up to see what he (the dog) was barking at and saw this grey triangular outline with orange lights against the clouds. The triangle was moving slowly going west to east. It had glowing orange lights in each angle of the triangle. I measured the size by holding my arm out and judging the lights to be about the size of a large pea at an arms length (that would be one of the three lights) . The object was perfectly silent. On the farm at 5:00 in the middle of summer it is pretty quiet. There was no wind at all. It was very still and perfectly quiet. Absolutely no sound came from the object. It moved at what seemed to be a very slow steady speed as it went directly overhead, with the dog going nuts the whole time. I called to my brother to get out there to see it but he was putting something together on the shifter and didn't come right away. As the object passed over our farm and went over the feild. it began to speed up and raise in altitude. This change was very obvious, even to me. It really sped up and it cruised up right off into the clouds. At about this time, my brother came out and asked what I wanted. I said "man you missed it". The dog ran out into the feild and went probably about 1/2 mile before he gave up and came back. Just directly West of our driveway was our neighbors runway. He was a crop duster and when he landed, he flew at pretty low altitude right over our house. Our dog was very used to that and could care less when it happened. This was very different. This is absolutely true. I have never reported this to anyone other than close freinds.<br>

I followed the light until it dissapeared over the horizon. I did not tell others until after it was gone, what I had seen, Because I was unsure of what I had seen. Within two minutes I explianed to my wife what I saw and she told me she had read about a meteor shower in the newspaper that morning. I did not see any sign of it hitting the ground. I am a computer specialist with a B. A. degree in Earth Science.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  1/5/2000<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I observed 2 rather small, dimly-lit long, triangular shaped objects flying in formation heading north at a rater low altitude at somewhere between 500 to 800 mph. At 8:35pm on the night of October 5th 1999, a friend and myself had just put his kids to bed and had stepped outside for a cigarette. It was an exceptionally clear evening and we were marveling at all of the stars out that night, when I asked him if he had ever seen one of those hundreds of satellites we have orbiting our planet. He responded that he hadn't, and so I told him that I could probably spot one for him within 10 or 15 minutes, and began scanning the skies for one. We were in a quiet neigborhood, but the neighbors porch-lights were making it difficult to see good, so I walked north between the two houses where the night-sky became more "observable". I was looking straight above me, when out the corner of my eye I saw a really fast moving blur to which I began to blurt out to my frind, "Look!, a shooting star". . . . But I only got out the words "Look! a shoo. . . . . . . " when My eyes were able to focus on the object. This was NO shooting star, NO aircraft man has ever built, and NO weather related phenomena! I could very CLEARLY see a long, thinly shaped triangle with only the edges lit up in a pale whitish outline. I had only focused on it for maybe a second or two when I noticed a 2nd one behind it a ways and to the right of the first one. They were flying precisely at the same speed and kept the distance between them so steady that they could have been flying as ONE! (unlike our known aircraft that fly in formation. . . . . they always seem to deviate a little from one another as they fly overhead) There were no blinking lights at all, only the complete outline of the triangles were dimly lit and the light seemed to gently fade from the outside edges inward, where the center of the craft appeared almost translucent. . . . . . sky-black with just a hint of reflected "ground-light" of whitish-green. It is very hard to determine the altitude of anything in the night sky, but to the best of my knowledge, they seemed to be flying rather low, maybe at an altitude of between 1, 000 and 3, 000 ft. Agai! n, in a night sky, size is difficult to determine also, and once again, I believe they seemed to be rather small craft, somewhere between 8 to 15 ft. in length, and maybe 5 to 9 ft. at their widest point, which would have been at the aft end of the triangular shapes. At this relatively low altitude, one would think that you would be able to hear some kind of sound, even if it was the sound of air rushing around them, as they flew at a very high rate of speed, . . . . . but there was NO sound whatsoever! I would have to guess they were traveling at a rate of maybe 500 to 800 mph, heading north in a straight line. At this speed and altitude, and given their rather dimly-lit appearance, I only observed them for maybe 5 seconds and they were out of sight. During this time of observaton, I was calling out to my friend and pointing towards them, asking if he was seeing what I was, and wondering why I wasn't hearing a response. Turns out, unfortunately, that one of his kids had called out to him, and he had turned and gone inside the house and didn't even hear me talking to him, much less SEE anything! I am a 50 yr. old aircraft mechanic of 32 years, living in Minnesota for the pat 20 yrs. I often fly comercially and recreationally, even though I do not posess a pilots license. I have always been interested in astronomy and enjoy observing our night skies, and believe me. . . . . . I will be observing our skies even more now, after witnessing this account, even though I don't really believe I will ever see anything so compelling as what I saw on that night in early October, 1999.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  3/12/2000<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  45 secs<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A bright light was apparently chased by several military jets. In the fall of 1957, shortly before the Sputnik satellite went up, I was in front of our house in St. Paul when I heard the roar of F-89s. The F-89 was an all-weather, 2-seater, twin engine fighter interceptor based at the main airport. With its very loud J-35 jet engines, they never or rarely ever flew at low altitudes over the metro area. It wasn't unusual to hear them take off, but it sounded as if the noise was lasting longer than usual. It was about 7:00pm, and already dark (before the Daylight Savings Time era) . (I couldn't positively identify the planes, but there was nothing else located there which made that much noise. The military areas of the airport also hosted F-80s, T-33s, C-47s, C-119s, Navy Phantoms, P2V Neptune sub hunters, helicopters, and miscellaneous others - none of which made such a horrendous racket. Commercial jets were not yet using the MSP airport except for 1 French twin engine jet which came and went, one day, as part of a sales mission.) After a while, I looked up and saw a row of red-hot exhaust pipes (or exhaust) and navigation lights all westbound, coming from the east at perhaps 5, 000 feet. It looked like a string of firey brands. They were making one heck of a racket, and I took them for the F-89's. Then I noticed a bright light in the sky - brighter than Venus in the western sky, except this light was in the wrong place to be Venus: it was south-southwest from me at an angle of almost 45 degrees, and hanging nearly over the airport. At first I thought it must be some kind of expensive, well-done prank. Then I thought it might be a helicopter with intensely bright lights. Finally, I noticed that the planes appeared to be headed straight for the object. The object remained in place as if it had all day to make up its mind if it were going to move or not. Finally, it DID begin to move - slowly at first - towards the southwest. The jets adjusted course to the southwest. Then the object picked up more and more speed, and finally turned off its brilliant white light, and sped away. It was still barely visible for a few moments after it switched off its light, and had a dull, glowing orange appearance, and had some small white lights around the main body. The jets followed in that direction, and eventually disappeared. All the noise finally stopped. I ran into the house and checked all the TV channels expecting to see a report on the object chased by the F-89's, but there were no reports. Nothing. Just your typical Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke, etc. Then I finally sat down to read the evening paper. On the front page was a small article which said: "Mystery Object Sighted Over RAF Base. A mystery object was sighted today over one of Britain's RAF bases, but when pursued, it doused its light and sped away. " I cut out the article and posted it on the bulletin board in our high school science class, explaining that I might have seen the same object.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  4/16/2000<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  30 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A bright light was seen in the sky that remained stationary. We lost track of it and then noticed a similar light in the northern sky. The light then faded away. It was an overcast day with no sky visible, just clouds. My friend and I were driving north on 2nd Ave S in Waite Park, MN when I noticed bright white light in the western sky to my friend. I commented on it and asked my friend 'what in the hell that was'. He thought it might have been an airplane, but I thought it was too bright. I took my eye off the object when we neared an intersection. I lost track of the light and dismissed it as mildly unusual. As we cleared the intersection, still headed north bound we both noticed an identical light in the northern sky. It was easy to follow, because we were driving in that direction. We watched the light for approximately 5 seconds when it seemingly lost its illumination slowly. It seemed to take a couple of seconds for the light to disappear. When it did there was no visual evidence of anything else in the sky, no aircraft, no nothing. By the way the light dissapated I thought it might be some sort of flare, but there was no ascent or descent of the light, rather it seemed to just disappear. It seemed possible that it may have been an aircraft, but the light was too bright and didn't seem to move and with the cloud cover being so great or distance of vision would have noticed a movement in an aircraft. The light never blinked, but seemed to be greatly illuminated. There were no towers or tall buildings in that area. In both cases the object appeared to be around 30 degrees ascension. I would have dismissed one strange light, but two in totally different areas of the sky in such short a length of time didn't make any sense to me or my friend. The bright white light was not huge in diameter. It seemed bigger than an airplane light. It was hard to gauge the distance, but like I mentioned earlier, it was overcast so it couldn't of been really far away. My witness and myself are in or mid 20's, don't do drugs, are sane individuals who witnessed something unusual. Any feedback on other simmilar sightings, or some sort of explanation would be great!<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  10-15 min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Small Cylinder seen in absolutely clear sky in morning. Heading north on Hwy 35w. No other objects in sky whatsoever. I and a friend were car pooling to our job from Edina to Roseville, Mn. Heading north on Hwy 35w. I noticed it first and was unsure of what I was seeing. I wached it for about 3-4 minutes w/o saying anything so that I could be sure. The sky was completely clear. The weather was crisp and slightly cold. It was low in the sky (say about the size of a pen point at first sighting and as we drew closer by about 10 miles about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length) . It was a very dark color. . . Gray bordering on black. At first it had definite edges. It reflected light at the edges. It stayed in one spot, seemingly motionless. I mentioned to my friend after a few minutes who is a skeptic and asked him, "What the h*ll is that?". He didn't know either. By the time we were as close to it as we were going to get it had dissipated into a cylinder shaped "cloud" or "mist" and was losing shape slowly. My father being a pilot I grew up around airports, airplanes and airshows and have always kept an eye to the sky. I have never seen anything like it. If it was a "cloud", why would one tiny, dark cloud form in a sky barren of any other weather formations? My friend was a little bothered by it and chalked it up to weather. I'm not so sure.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  2 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A dull-orange craft sped southbound at low altitude and high speed toward the general direction of the airport. It was October of 1958, and I had been out collecting for my paper route. (In those days, paper boys collected the bill from customers monthly, in person. I usually quit collecting for the evening around 9:00pm.) Rather than going straight into the house when I got home, I decided to get on my bike and amble somewhere. I started traveling down the alley at a slow pace - going nowhere in particular - and I saw the glow from the lights of the college football field, and decided to head over there and check the score of the game. I gazed upward and noticed that the night was filled with stars; it was absolutely clear and pristine. What a knock-your-socks-off beautiful night! I looked forward again, down the pitch black alley, and I suddenly saw a strange, dull-orange craft streak across the sky, over the football field, heading southbound, parallel to Snelling Avenue. It appeared like 2 bat-wings cut out of an orange paper plate, with 3 sides in total (front, back of left wing, back of right wing) , and all sides smooth and rounded, except the tips which had normal points. Its altitude was perhaps 300 feet. Viewing time was perhaps 2 seconds. I could easily tell: It wasn't from "around here". I slammed on the brakes of my bike, and just stood there in the dark stillness of the night, realizing that I had just seen my second UFO, and that I couldn't prove it to a single soul. . . There had been no other witnesses that I know of. The stars kept shining, and the crowd watching the game would occasionally cheer, and the traffic kept moving up and down Snelling as the people went about their business, scurrying to and fro. . . Years later, around 1978 or so, I was watching a documentary movie on TV called "Flying Saucers Are Real" or something like that, when I saw an account of a UFO encounter by an Army helicopter. This happened in Ohio, when a Lt. Col. Coyne and his crew were effortlessly pulled up several thousand feet by a large ship. An artist had made colored drawings, based on Coyne's testimony (he went public with it) . It was an enormous, gray, metallic hulk of hi-tech engineering, and it had a dark red design on the nose which I recognized. The design was a kind of 4-pronged "splat", or jelly-fish, or thick cross-hairs, which if viewed from the side, appeared to be a kind of bat wing, or unusual flying wing (not like the Northrup flying wings) . I suddenly realized that what I'd seen back in October of 1958 was POSSIBLY the nose art of a much larger craft. What appeared to me like a large, orange craft, had possibly just been the tip of the iceberg of a MUCH larger, huge, gray, silent piece of engineered metal. . . Either way, it was big, fast and silent.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  3/12/2000<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Flash<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  2.5 hours<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A strobe light flashed for 2 1/2 hours over a neighbor's house. It was in late September, 1992. The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street in Golden Valley, when I saw a flash in a cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices) . I remarked out loud to myself, "He's too low!". He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St. Paul airport that I'd seen any planes take. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I'd seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It came from the same cloud I'd seen earlier! (It was a very large, white cloud, and unmistakable) . I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating in the south, going around in a circle, and striking something with each pass. When the beam made contact, something flashed in the cloud. I had NEVER seen anything like this before! Why I didn't try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I'll never know. I simply stood there and thought, "Isn't that interesting. . . . " - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o'clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and came out at perhaps 11:00pm. The clouds had now drifted away, but the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight! Even though the clouds were gone, when it flashed, there seemed to be a variable haze around the flash. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. It was late and 3 of my neighbors had young children at that time, so I didn't feel comfortable calling them at 10:00 or 11:00pm or later, to say, "Come out and look at this strobe light which flashes every 30 seconds. . . ". I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type) , and he had never heard of anything like it either. I was able to triangulate its location using a city map left over from the Street Light Project in our neighborhood, since I had 2 sightings of the object from 2 different angles. This thing was located approximately over the street or over a neighbor's house in front of my house! Frankly, I was flabbergasted - even though the triangulation was simple, and could really have been done in my head if I'd been thinking. Since that episode, I've purchased a videocamera and a 500, 000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight. Maybe next time (if there IS a next time) , I won't be so timid and mush-brained! Next time, I will videotape it, put a searchlight on it, use the binoculars, and call a neighbor for corroboration.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Egg<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 5-6 silver, egg-shaped craft desending one by one at early sunrise on Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis. I was looking across Lake Calhoun from a window on the top floor of the Calhoun Beach Club. It was still pretty dark since the sun was just starting to rise. I saw something reflecting the sunlight to the southwest, and at first I thought it was an airplane since it was in the sky and the sun hadn't risen high enough to touch the tops of buildings or treetops. The window in which I looked from was open and it was very quiet out side, and I didn't hear a sound coming from it. As I looked I realised it could'nt be a plane because it was too small; or a hellicopter because it made no noise. It was like a big silver egg the size of a small house, and it was wobbling back and forth and up and down slowly above some houses about one quarter of the way around the lake to the left of my view. it then calmed down and slowly started to desend. It seemed to drop in front of the houses but behind the trees before going out of sight. Then, there were more flying to the same area above the trees. First one, then another, then two at once. All were moveing in the same odd way, then slowly dropping down behind the trees and out of sight one at a time. I tried to wake up my friend who was in the bedroom and I brought him out to look, but he was mad that I woke him up and wouldn't listen. He just went back to bed. I didn't want to miss this experience though, so I went back to the window to see. In all, I probably saw 5-6 craft that night. I don't tell many people about what happend, since I recieved alot of flack about it in the past, although I wish I had written down the date and time. That was the last thing on my mind. If there is anyone else in that area of Minneapolis who has seen these craft, plese contact me. I am a sky-watcher now.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  3/12/2000<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Cigar<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  3 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A cigar-shaped UFO glided down towards the earth at a 45 degree angle, but was lost in the ground clutter. It was February, 1960 when my friend LB and I had stopped at a local dairy store on Grand Avenue, bought our candy and chatted with the owner, and left when it closed at 10:00pm. We walked over to the vocational school next to our old grade school, and stood talking about aviation and rockets and anything interesting. There had been an F-84 parked in front of the vocational school for a few years. The school had removed the jet engine and taken it inside to be used in training jet engine mechanics. The plane remained out front as an advertisement for the school. Eventually, someone must have gotten nervous about the possibility that a kid might hurt himself on it, so it was towed away. So that's where LB and I liked to stand and talk: it was near the F-84 - or at least, where it now USED to be. . . It was now around 10:15pm. LB and I had been talking and trying to keep warm for about 15 minutes. The conversation felt like it was winding down, which was fine with me: it must have been around 20 degrees outside. Suddenly, while LB was saying something, I saw an unbelievable sight. It's fantastic - but I swear I saw it. A huge, cigar-shaped, wingless, engineless, noiseless lighted craft appeared from behind something - I think it was an apartment house - and quietly and swiftly glided down an imaginary slope as if it were on invisible railroad tracks. Each end was tapered and blunted - like the lit end of a fresh cigar. It was silvery in color, and had 8 to 10 round portholes with white light coming out of them. I did not see anyone or anything inside the ship. It was roughly in front of me and to my left - behind LB - and seemed very close: perhaps less than a block away. I was absolutely stunned. It was huge, it was bright, it was close, and it was moving closer. I thought it was going to land or crash. I was nearly speechless and momentarily afraid to move. My left arm shot out past LB's shoulder and I yelled, "LOOK!!!". LB has always been noted for his quick reactions, but for some unknown reason he reacted slowly on this occasion. He started to turn to his left (the wrong way) , then changed his mind and turned slowly to his right (towards where I was pointing) . By the time he was fully turned, the ship had disappeared behind ground clutter - houses, trees, bushes, etc. I yelled, "It should reappear over there!", pointing and running towards where I thought it might reappear. But it never emerged. It was apparently gone forever. While I was trembling and out of breath, LB was calm, collected, and slightly puzzled and bemused. Did LB - the world's greatest skeptic - believe me? Certainly not. He didn't think I was lying - he knew I wouldn't lie to him, but he thought that perhaps I'd seen an optical illusion caused by the newly installed mercury street light, a hundred or more feet away. But, as to practicality, I've seen billions and billions of mercury street lights, yard lights and playground lights, and not once have I thought I saw a silvery, cigar-shaped UFO come gliding out of the night in their vicinity - EXCEPT for that one time. Science, to be science, must be repeatable. LB's theory is not repeatable, nor can it be science. I saw what I saw - so far, once and only once in my lifetime.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I had been driving home from work and I seen lights rotating. I stopped and backed up to get a better look. While backing up the UFO quickly reversed with me. I shifted into drive and the UFO followed me for another 100 yards. Then it began to retreat as I hurried home. The UFO had multiple lights originating on the larger part of the teardrop, and had a number between 2-4 lights on the narrow part of the craft. Many lights (6-7) originated from the larger part of the teardrop shaped craft. While only 2-4 came from the narrow tip. It was extremely fast in the way it followed my reverse. It had been hovering about 100 feet from the roadside over trees. The lights were like chasing lights it would start from the front from where I could see and move to the left. Then it would skip an area and continue along the back until it came around to the front again. It seemed to have a dome shaped area on top of it on the larger end, and the bottom appeared to be flat.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> We had seen a Bright light in the sky just NW of Waseca Mn, We had noticed a very bright light in the NW part of the sky, after we had droped a friend off at there farmhouse we thought the light might hav moved when we reached the end of the drivway it had not moved we sat at the end of the driveway for about 20min to watch the light, my friend and I where looking at it he said he saw it "swaying slightly" when I was looking at it I saw it change colors white, red, blue, changing patterns at randome always starting with white and ending with white. We saw the light drop down below a line of tree's we decided to follow chase drove down the road about 3/4 of a mile we where heading west we noticed on our right side through the tree's we saw the craft because of the time and darkness we only saw the what we belived to be the back of the craft, it was covered with lights that where pulsing not flashing like a strobe, going dim bright the lights seemed to be white in color, we where the only car on the road but it was a rural road, it the craft was moving in a westerly direction and then seemed to speed up (I noticed my speedomiter was reading 75 mph) and it was pulling away fast as it pulled away faster it was nolonger able to distinguish induviual lights and it looked again looked like a VERY bright light heading towards the towns of Janesville mn and Mankto mn at that time we stoped the chase after aprox 8 miles later the next day I had been talking to some people who said that they too had "seen a bright light in the sky" NW of waseca but did know what it was.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  30 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Me and my friend witness a bright blue light moving rapidly across the sky. It moved across 60 degrees of the sky approximately, then disappeared. On the above date and time, me and my friend were taking a walk along an unlit street near where I live. My friend pointed and told me to look over my left shoulder, in the east. I saw a bright light about the size of a dime at arms length, the light was a blueish white color, it was moving fairly quickly across the sky, but there was plenty of time for me to turn my head and see it for about 10 or 20 seconds, the light moved from the northeast to the southeast in an arcing path, which led me to believe it was far away. Before the object reached the horizon it disappeared. We heard no noise. I do not believe this was a shooting star because it was way to big, it was constant, and it lasted too long.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Oval<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> my girfriend and i saw an opaque outline of an oval elongated object with lights foreward, midship and aft dissappear within an instant with no sound of any kind. my girfriend and i were returning home at about sunset when we heard the loud noise coming from a propeller plane overhead. we stopped on an open outside porch waiting to see the plane clear our roof line so we could determine if it was in trouble. the plane cleared our roof line at less than 1000 ft so i thought it was either in trouble or may be trailing a lighted sign for us to see. neither seems to be the case but as we looked at the plane going from east to west we noticed south from our house an opaque shape. the object was about 60 feet long by 30 plus feet high narrower and the ends than the middle with lights fore, aft and midship. what we really mnoticed was the absence of lights coming from an adjacent street or the four floors of our hospital we normally see or the lights from a 10 story apartment bldg our vision was being blocked by something. we stared at the object and felt we were being watched but neither of us felt afraid. we could not grasp what our eyes were seeing it just would not register. it is as if you were looking at a puzzle to solve and need a lot of time to solve it after 3 to 5 minutes of us staring at it and looking back at the noisy plane trying to make sense of anything. we kept returning to the object again and again as if each time we refocused it would make sense. within an instant, this does not adequatly describe the spped. within a millesecond all we could see was a trail of the three lights we noticed stretching for over a mile in the sky. at that momemnt we knew we had come accross something out of anything our mind could accept. there no sound when it left, no noise from the leaves on the trees and bushes which wee near. no noise at all except from that noisy plane which had turned from east to west to west to east from the south. the other uneplainable was when we first started looking at the object there was a beautiful sunset and when it left the sunset was gone and it was dark. strange yet was the noisy plane was alwys in ear shot with us it never left us. my girlfriend and me wrote each other notes about waht we saw without dicussing it in detail that night. our notes comapre exactly with the primary emphasis on the speed and no noise. while lokking at the object we kept ying to each " what is this" " what are we seeing" each time we would both say i don't now. the next day we thought we would contact our local airport to see if we could track down the pilot of the noisy plane but decided not to draw attention to ourselves. however, later the next day while listening to our radio while washing our cars we heard a live broadcast of a sherrif chasinfg a ufo in another county. never heard another word after this. i would appreciate any kind of response either affirming this report or explaining it away. thanks<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Flash<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  2.5 hours<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A flashing bright, white light hovered over my neighborhood for over 2 hours. It was in late September, 1992. The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street when I saw a bright, white flash apparently emanating from a large cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices) . I think I remarked out loud, "He's too low!!". He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St. Paul airport. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I'd seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It appeared to come from inside the same cloud as before, although it might have been below it and in front of it, creating its own haze. Since I had sighted it from 2 different angles, I was able to mentally triangulate its location, and later used a city map left over from a Street Light Project to do the same with a ruler. This thing was located approximately over a neighbor's house or front yard across the street, not much higher than the tops of the trees - perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 times the height of the local elm trees. I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating from the south, going around in a circle. Whenever the searchlight beam aligned with the object, there would be a flash apparently in the cloud. The searchlight beam was far too high to hit the object and cause a reflection. The closest advertising searchlights (used by car dealers, etc.) would have been about a mile away since the area is entirely residential up to that point. At that distance, a searchlight beam would have been hundreds of feet high by the time it intersected my neighborhood. Why I didn't try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I'll never know. I simply stood there and thought, "Isn't that interesting. . . . " - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o'clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and when I came out at perhaps 11:00pm, the clouds had drifted away. But the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight!! The flash seemed to be enveloped in a haze when it occurred, but there was no visible haze in the air prior to the flash. There was also no "object" visible. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type) , and he had never heard of anything like it either. Since that episode, I've purchased a videocamera and a 500, 000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight of my own! Maybe next time (if there IS a next time) , I'll tape it!<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I ran across your web site and will relate my experience, I was driving to the post office with my monthly mail and this would usually be on the 2nd of the month in midsummer of 1999. I was driving west on Minnehaha ave on the east side of St. Paul and suddenly straight down the middle of the road about 25 to 30 degrees up and about a half mile away was this bright aluminum colored object. I watched it for the length of time it took me to drive a city block or so, when I had to take my eyes off of it because I was meeting another car coming towards me, this was only a couple of seconds and when I looked up to look at it again, it was gone. The object was a bright aluminum color with a domed shaped top and a flat bottom. It was about twice as high as the diameter and was in the shape of a cylinder. The sides were not smooth, there were vertical lines running from bottom to top that seemed to be there to give the structure strength. Size, about 40-50 feet high and 20-25 feet in diameter.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Ball lightning phenomOn my girlfriends birthday so I'm sure of the date. I originally thought that the object was a crashing aircraft that may hit me judging from it's descent path so I slammed on my brakes and killed my engine. (Foolish, I know) Object displayed no engine sound but did may have made a slight electrical crackling sound. It descended over a small lake in front of me, I was driving a suzuki samuri (Jeep) so I was able to observe it without glass in my line of sight. Object displayed lighting effects on surrounding trees similar to lightning but in a steady stream. Object continued to approach in my general direction untill it was about midway over the lake and in my estimate about 55 feet over the water. I held my arm strait out with fist to estimate size and at its closest (largest) it was covered by 1/2 with my closed hand. Object definately made a wooshing sound (similar to a flag in high wind) apon leaving and exited at a tremendous speed. I do not believe object was a craft but may have been an example of "Ball Lightning" Though I have read everything I could about the subject science does not seam to understand it. I believe that it was repelled by its proximity to the water, And I would like to know if this has been reported before. Object approached at an aproximate 40 degree angle and left at an aproximate 45. I can not be certain whether object retreated from me or dissipated so quickly that it appeared to retreat. Object was white in color similar to a strobe light or lightning flash with some orange.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Light over minneapolisI was driving home from work at 9 AM I peripherly saw a light so I looked up and what I saw was a round light about a mile away similar to a shooting star that had entered earths atmosphere, but it did not break up, it stayed the same. It went down to the ground very fast. I estimate the altitude at about 5000 feet above ground level. It must have been going over a thousand miles per hour. I thought maybe it was a firework, being the july fourth weekend. However, I did not see any fireworks in the area before or after the sighting. To me, this was a ufo. It is possible that this is explainable, and not out of this world, but it traveled faster than anything manmade (airplane, etc.)<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The rate of speed and no soundI just happen to step out last night to see what the weather was like, so as if we should open up the house. I know it was over cast and I could hear a commercial air liner in the distance. As I looked up I saw a bright flash, similar to a strobe light on an aircraft , what caught my attention , was the time and distance between flashes. No plane I've ever seen could travel that fast between flashes, and what was even more strange, there was no sound, absouletly none. Like I said there was a distant sound of a jet , and that was still heard after this object was long gone. It moved from the southeast toward the northwest, like from Winona MN to Minneapolis MN. The total time I observed this object, couldn't have been morre than 15 secs. I know for sure I saw 3 flashes, then due to my location where I was standing, with trees and the house, buy the time I changed my stand for another view, it was gone. It was overcast, and I'm not sure what the ceiling was, but it's my guess it had to be less then 3000' and it definitely was under the overcast.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright yellowins green extrmely fast cirular object leaving a light trail as it traveled upward out of sightThe object seen was a circular object seen in the eastern skies. IT was a bright yellowinsh green color. Its motion was faster then any of us had ever seen before, the object travel back and forth and an extrodinary speed. At this point a spot light of great magnitude could have been the result but as we continued to watch this object in the sky it began to move faster, it mad 2 or 3 quick moments upward, then a great burst of speed it took off upward into the sky. It had a light trail and left what seemed to be a vapor trail. By our understanding, the only possible way somethign is able to leave a light trail is if it is traveling the speed of light or beyond, but not positive about that fact. Me as well as the other witnesses have pnndered the sighting and an ufo is the only reasonable thing that we ahve agreed on.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> We were camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area on Basswood Lake near Ely, Minnesota. That particular evening we fished until 11:00pm and returned to camp to build a fire. My little brother had went to sleep in the tent while myself and our other couterpart went to the point to observe the stars. We admired the scenery for a while when we noticed a star that appeared to be descending from the sky. It was a blue diamond shaped object that seemed to be falling from the sky. We became aprehensive when the object began to descent twoard us. As the object became closer I was contemplating my escape, which would be impossible through the enourmous amout of dense forest and underbush however, my main concern was my little brother asleep in the tent 100 feet behind us. We said if the object made it to the island 350 yards infront of us we were going to make a break for it. All of a sudden the object make a complete 90 degree turn and headed directly north at a speed that I can not even estimate. Immediately after we seen this phenomenon we decided to turn in for the night. To this day my counterpart and I still have the same exact recollection of that particular evening. I was wondering if any of the other campers on Basswood at that time had observed the same experience. I know that the object flew direclty over another capsite on the adjourinig point beore heading north to Canada. I am reluctant to submit my personal information for fear of riducule and to protect my professional reputatuion. This was second of my sighings while camping as a teenager near Clinton Lake, Lawrence Kansas in the late 80's a myself and a friend observed an object that would split into several smaller objects and would all of a sudden reapperar from all directions to form one object for a multi hour duration.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  4.5 to 5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw 3 satellite-like objects move from Big Dipper to SSE part of sky in varying formation over about 5 minutes. Sighting Date/Time: August 5, 2000, maybe 11:45-12:10PM Sighting Location: Sighting occurred while on the beach of the Minnesota river, approx 3 miles E-NE of Le Sueur, MN Sighting Description: We were fishing on the bank of the Minnesota River. We had all been watching for satellites and had even had 2 in perpendicular orbits pass real close to one another (2" at arms-length I'd estimate) and there was about 5 of us seeing it. We all thought that was cool. August also sees an increase in meteoric activity, which we all took in. Skies were mostly clear, humid, 70F, 1/2? moon in the West. I had been left on the shore to watch the catfish lines while my friends went back to town to get another 4X4 truck. I sat, watching satellites go by, and the frequent falling stars, when I looked North to the lowest part of the spoon in the Big Dipper constellation. I watched a light become bright as it moved in what would become a S-SE direction. I assumed, that the increase in light intensity was due to the sun's position below the horizon, and the satellite entering the light from the long-set Sun. (We know that as satellites move into the Earth's shadow, the light fades and they disappear. And I grew up in the country with my dad's 8" reflector Celestron with the Earth-clock tripod, so I know my way around the stars well enough to hold the evening's conversation.) Anyway, as I watched the "satellite" move, I noticed that it was a slower speed than any of the (at least 6) satellites I had observed in that evening, and suddenly I saw another appear behind it, maybe 1/2" at arms-length at perhaps 4 o'clock as looking at a clock. I thought that this was a treat, since seeing two satellites in such proximity is rare, (if not totally regulated "illegal" by some NASA trajectory-assignment committee) . From the time I saw the first, until the second appeared, was possibly 20 seconds. At this point, they may have been 3/4 of the distance through an arc between the horizon and a vertical axis going up through my body. As soon as I saw the second, I had two reference points moving in the sky, and was immediately aware that the speed of one was erratic at best. Using the stars in the background, I was then able to verify that they traveled less a trajectory, but rather in a meandering direction, neither holding a constant speed at this point. The second never passed the first. Then, as they were at a point I would describe as 11 O'clock, I saw the third. I felt a rush of disappointment that everyone had left. I watched the three lights, and I hate to try and judge their altitude, but I would put them as "orbit". If you were to hold a 30/60/90 triangle up in the air, with the right-angle facing to your right, that is a good representation of the "formation" they tried to hold, and the hypotenuse of the triangle would be no larger than an inch at arms-length. They all seemed to "inch-worm" across the sky, all wavering slightly in direction, still traveling at what must have been an ungodly speed, with conservative accelerations to what seemed to be trying to preserve the formation. At this point, I had been watching them for probably 2 minutes, had taken off my glasses, looked away, shook my head, opened a 7Up, looked back and they were all still there. I shouted at them, waved, screamed at them that their formation looked shitty, and began to realize that the third, the dimmest of the three could not keep control. The second seemed to act as a "chase-plane", like the Tigers that follow the Shuttle's entry. Sometimes, the second would slow to alongside the third, making equilateral triangle, sometimes drop behind, but not for long. It seemed intent on trying to hold its own position in the formation. I hate to say it, but it seemed like none of them were keeping control. I watched them for what I would estimate as 4. 5-5 minutes, as they crossed the arc of the sky. It actually became boring, as I wanted to see some of those eye-blinking accelerations I have heard of. But they continued to stumble their way across the sky at from my vantage seemed a languid, haphazardly jaunt. They faded out of light in the S-SE, as would a satellite re-entering the Earth's shadow. That's one of the reasons I say their altitude was orbit-level.<br>

A BRIGHT light, such as landing lights on a commerical jet approaching at a distance of several miles, plus red and green flashing lights. Stayed in one location for quite a time, and then moved higher and lower a bit (jerking movements up, down and to the south, and then over about 2 hours gradually moved to the southwest and higher and eventually it became nearer, and then dawn came and we could no longer view it. There is no commerical airport within over 75 miles of here - and we NEVER see any landing lights here -- also, we have never seen landing lights with the interposed flashing red and green lights.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> close encounter of the 5th kind (interaction with being from ufo) this report is being submitted in response to the ufo sighting reported here for ely, minnesota, on 6/8/00, in the boundary waters canoe area. i also saw a similar ufo back in june of 1984. the location . i was on a canoe trip and it was about 7:00pm. i had just finished cleaning up after dinner and was getting ready to do some evening fishing from the shoreline. i had just reached the shore when i noticed a blue-ish object descending at about a 45deg angle from about a mile away. the speed was similar to a formula one racing car at speed (200+ mph) and the altitude when i first noticed it was maybe 1 mile. (i used to sky-dive, road-race cars and motorcycles, and pilot airplanes, so i am a good judge of speed and distance.) the object passed in front of me (over the lake) at a distance of maybe 100 yards and an altitude of maybe 200 feet. it wa slowing continually during the descent. there was no sound. when it was at its closest, i could see through the glow and the object was shaped similarly to a diamond in a woman's engagement ring. (round when viewed from the top; near flat on top and expanding to a wider profile then tapering to a point in the side view) the color was varied from the blue of a royal crown cola can through to the color emitted by a blacklight. it disappeared behind the treeline maybe 100 yards down the shoreline. i stood there stunned for a couple of minutes and was getting ready to walk down the shoreline to see if i could see anything more when i noticed the movement of something coming through the woods. all i will say here about what happened over the next hour is that i communicated through telepathy (i didn't initiate the conversation and just had to think what i wanted to say.) with a blond-nordic. i did not go to the craft and didn't not see it except when it passed in front of me while descending and when it left. (it ascended in reverse of the way it descended.) there was no "physical examination". i wa sober and was not tired. i am not subject to hallucinations. i have a measured i. q. that qualified me for membership in "intertel". when i was in the military (1968-1971) , i was a sergeant and worked as a fire distribution systems crewchief in aadcp's for nike-hercules missile defense syetems and had several ufo sightings on our radar systems both in the united states and korea. these were also seen by the members of my crews. my father and i also saw a cigar-shaped ufo over kansas in the summer of 1964 as we were flying one of the family planes from our home in iowa to the family ranch in oklahoma. my father also had a sighting in 1962 when he was driving from iowa to the family cabin in minnesota. he told me that he spotted something that landed in a field next to the road he was on. he said it was about 1/4 mile away from his car to the spot where it touched down. my father had a pilot's license from 1955 to when he passed away in 1973. he also built his own airplanes and was a groundcrew crewchief in the army air corps in morocco during the war.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A V shaped craft with amber colored lights that was a big as a football field heading west towards Anoka, Minnesota on August 18, 1996. The thing was as big as a football field. It was V shaped. The lights were amber colored and what appeared to be dimmed. The first thing I thought was "How tricky of them. They are trying to blend in with the street lights. " It had approx. fifteen sets of lights on each side except the first light which was a single one. It was moving directly west. It was so low that by the time I ran a half of a block I was directly behind it and it was getting blocked by the trees . I really wanted to see if I could see the stars through the middle or not but to see if it was solid but it was passing through the trees. I thought I may have. Even though I didn't get to see it for very long, it was no doubt amazing and HUGE! It's funny, but right before I saw it I had thought to myself "It would be a good night to see a U. F. O. " A couple of minutes later I saw it. About a year later I heard some other people had seen a U. F. O. directly east of where I was and the same description. The area I saw this in is a populated suburb of Minneapolis and was moving directly into the city of Anoka. I wish I had known of your reporting network back then. Even though it was 3:18 in the morning I had not been drinking. I had been dropping a friend off at home. The craft was silent. I found that amazing!<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Circle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  20minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Circular object follows car, 4 witnesses. A single bright circular object was seen hovering over a friend's house, whom of which we were picking up to go to dinner on Valentine's Night. This object followed the car as we left, and proceeded to follow us through more than 8 miles along a gravel road. Along the way we didn't encounter any other vehicles. The object made no noise except for a slight humm, and stayed along the right hand side of the car, just above the treeline. There were 4 witnesses in the car, who all claimed to have seen the same thing. As we turned onto a highway, the UFO followed us from behind, and a huge spotlight came down, covering a large feild on one side of the road, and the highway behind us. It was following closely, and seemed to be catching up to us, and another car came over a hill from the other way, and the object seemed almost to disappear from view, it didn't exactly disappear, but it moved much more quickly than any manmade craft is able to. We checked as soon as we reached our destination and it seems that we didn't lose any time. I saw the craft numerous times after, always hovering near the house at night after dark, and two other witnesses who were in the car claim to have seen it other times afterwards. It was a different shape when it would hover near my house, it would change shapes to the pattern of the moon. If there was a half moon, it too would be a half circle, and if it was a sliver moon, it would be a sliver too, but it changed colors from white, to yellow, to orange, and even red. It would hover very closely, and would wake me up out of a sound sleep. I haven't seen it since August of 1996, and the last time, I was with two other witnesses who saw it zip across the sky. I can count over 10 witnesses in the year of 1996 who have all seen the same object that year in the same area.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A flattened out "V", made up of many pinpoints of light glided silently, smoothly, but quickly over-headI saw something out of the corner of my eye. I first thought it was the "V" formation of a flock of birds. I cupped my ear to listen, but it made absolutely no sound. It glided smoothly but quickly from the North towards a South-southeasterly direction. It spanned the portion of sky from Hercules to Capricornus (where I lost it behind the trees) in about 5 seconds. It was shaped like a flattened out "V". At arms length it was about 3" across and about 1" long. It's shape was made up of many pinpoints of white lights, not brilliant, about as bright as the average star. It was a perfectly clear night, the moon had not risen yet. I was outside just gazing at how spectacular the milky way looked when I saw it. My background: 37 year old male, I own a hardware store, I have a college degree in marketing and management, I am an avid starwatcher, I own a telescope, I do not believe in extraterrestrial life but I am miffed by what I just saw.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Sattelite objects moving at random across the sky , at speeds never seen before. Well it was seasons opener for fishing, a friend and myself were up along the Boundry Waters. It was a clear night you could see the stars great and we were laying on bedrock looking up at them. We talk of sattelite's something I had never seen or at least recognized. Later I saw what just seemed to me another star but all of a sudden it moved from north to the southern part of the sky so fast it was like a blink of an eye. Then it happen again only at an angle from which it had come from and then another did. At this time I tapped my friend and told him to look and pointed to were one had stoped and now three were moving at random moving across the sky so fast you could hardly keep up with them and then take off again in another direction. Sometimes in this movement across the sky they would make a right angle without hessitation, or delay. At this point I asked if he saw them also and he did, and about all he could say is that they did'nt move like any sattelite he had ever seen? What were they? We don't know, they resembled a star or sattelite, but moved so fast across such a distance and at random making angled manovers that I believe that it was'nt man made machinery. Nor were they falling stars those I have seen. Oh and I forgot all 3 moved off in a southern direction and just dissappered. [NUFORC Note: Approximate date. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> a point of light which flew zig-zags, loops and back and forth over an area of minnesotas north woods. it was nearly midnight. standing on a dock in a bay of lake vermillion i was star-gazing when i saw a distant light to the north a few degrees above the distant treeline. my immedite feeling was fear, the light was zig-zagging at about the rate an airplane might fly and it looked like it was lost, searching for a landmark in the darkness and so i feared for the plane's safety. as i watched the plane turned around and headed back to where i first saw it, but this time without zig-zagging. it then zig-zagged in an ascending way, flew what appeared to be a few degrees off of heading in my direction and gradually did a series of 3 loops. this was followed by a long, straight flight back in the same direction as the first zig-zag, and a straight flight back to near where it did loops. by now i was so fascinated i turned to look in the boat for my binoculars and when i turned back, the light was gone. there was no strobe, just a constant point of white light. it kept a steady speed. there was no sound. i looked at maps the following day and there is very little development in this section of northwoods. my rational mind says it was a pilot out for a midnight joyride. most planes here are seaplanes. what do you think. please answer.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Perfect semi circle vapor trail left as soundless UFO makes a turn-around overhead. On a clear Fall nite away from city lights, we saw a triangular shaped object approach us from the East traveling at a high rate of speed at about 11 oclock from the horizon. When it was almost directly overhead at about 5000 ft. (estimated) , it stopped dead in its tracks. We could see that the bottom of the object was silvery and kind of ossilated slowly from green to red to maroon across this silvery "underbody" of the object. . . at the three points of the triangular object where reddish orange lights that sometimes turned to a greenish color. After sitting motionless and soundless for about a half a minute, it made a slow 180 degree turn leaving a vapor trail. After making the slow and perfect turn, the object again sat motionless for a few seconds , and then took of straight and level at an icredible speed "in a flash" it reached a point about 15 miles east of us just above the horizon. Again the object stopped dead for about 10 seconds , then when straight up at incredible speed until it went out of sight. After this had all taken place, we noticed that the vapor trail was still disapating directly overhead in the atmosphere where the object had made the 180 degree turn around. This vapor trail seemed identical to that which you see when a high altitute aircraft leaves a vapor trail. This trail widened, and distorted over a period of about 3 minutes or so. Our observation was that the original vapor trail formed an absolutely perfect 180 Degree semi circle. . No vapor trail was caused by the craft when it was excelerating away from us or toward us. . . Only during the perfect turn. . . During all of this there was never any sound coming from the object. . [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  1/14/2001<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  1hr55min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Myself, a friend, two 9-yr old children watched a pulsating craft hover over the St. Louis River in Cloquet, just at the edge of town. I lived on a hill, giving an excellent view of the river and the craft from about 1/4 mile away. My friend and I had just returned from a coffee and pie outing at the local Perkins. We walked around to the back of the house and entered through the sliding glass door. The two children were in an almost hysterical state, shouting about the &quot;tornado&quot; which had passed over our house at a very low level. I tried to calm them down, and told them to draw me a picture of what they had seen (in separate rooms) . They drew virtually identical pictures of an upside-down &quot;ice cream cone&quot; with spinning marks and colored lights. They estimated that it barely cleard the top of my 1-story rambler. It continued to the river and either landed or hovered just above the opposite bank. (north of our house. Evidently it had come from the south &amp; traveled north. As we spoke, the kids pointed to where the object still was, on or near the river bank. I saw only a red (sometimes light green) pulsating light on or near the river bank. We watched it for 1 hour and 55 minutes exactly. During this time, it kept getting brighter; then dimmer. As it brightened, it seemed to become larger. I watched it thru binoculars, but could not make out a shape behind the light. My friend, the kids, and the 15 year old babysitter, watched and talked. Toward the end of the sighting, it did some spectacular things; the babysitter had gone home, but my friend stayed and watched with us. During the time we watched, we all tried to come up with some type of explanation for what it could be; we all concluded that it could not be human made; it was just too bizarre looking. There was no road or path it could have taken to get where it was. It was basically a swamp. We went there the following day to see if it had left any evidence of itself; it had not. We had to go on foot, climbing over fallen tree! s, etc. Anyway, just after 11:30, it suddenly turned an intense white, shot to the center of the river, and dispensed a laser-like dirty-white light onto the river. This lasted about 5 minutes or so. Then it suddenly turned that intense white again and took off up to the top of the opposite river bank; a distance of approx. 1/4 mile. So now it was a full 1/2 mile away. It stopped above the only other house in the area; a new, large multi-level home. The object shined a spotlight-type light that lit up the whole house and the yard; it looked like a helicopter search light, but much larger and brighter. The house lights had previously been off, but when this light show happened, all the house lights came on. I don&#39;t know if they actually saw this thing; and I haven&#39;t called them or discussed it with them. The owner is the county court administrator, and currently the mayor of Cloquet. I was just too embarrassed to ask a county official if he had seen the ufo. I was also too embarrassed to make a report right away. The next day I did call the local police to see if anyone else had made a report; none had. After about 2-4 minutes of scoping out this new house, the ufo suddenly brightened and shot off over the top of the hill and out of sight. I told the kids to go to bed; that they&#39;d never see anything like that during their lives. I barely got out that statement when Zoom!! Back it came, shined its blinding whit light DIRECTLY AT US for several seconds before shooting off to the north and out of sight. The movements of this &quot;thing&quot; were completely unbelievable. It moved so fast that it reminded me of a child playing a flashlight on a wall in the dark. Nothing moves that fast. It&#39;s impossible!! During the sighting, the kids flicked on the floodlights to see if it would respond. It did. The kids turned the lights (6 of them) on and off three times. The object responded by brightening three times. I had the feeling it could hear what we were saying and thinking, because of the ways it seemed to r! espond t o us. The weather was completely clear, no moon visible. No wind at all. About 5 minutes after it left, however, a heavy fog came rolling down the river west to east, and completely obscured the view.<br>

When it was almost directly overhead, it began to change into an orange color and then back to the white. When it changed color it did so gradually, and started in the center, and then worked it's way to the thin pieces that were attached to the circle. The thin pieces then began to flash orange and white. Even though it was very close, it was silent.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> flaring white lightWe were sitting outside when a white light, which was at that moment stationary, gradually flared very bright and large. It was perfectly silent and seemed far away even when it was at its largest. Then it reduced its size and emanation and began moving--it must have been very fast because it seemed like it was moving outward into space. It grew smaller and disappeared in a very small distance from where it had been stationary. Exactly 2 weeks later and at just about the same time we saw it again, exactly as we'd seen it the first time. [NUFORC Note: Sighting is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite. PD]<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  2 secs<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> At approx 2100 hrs. local I was southbound on US Highway 75 approx 8 miles north of Crookston, MN. I was heading almost due south. I noticed a shooting star, but this was not run of the mill, I drive truck on a 12 hour night shift 1700 - 0500 and see lots of shooting stars and i usually check for active times (showers) on the internet. The one I saw this night was different in all respects. . . size, brilliance, colors and proximity in the sky. I had visual contact for 1. 5 seconds or so. It was a brilliant white ball with a blue and tuquoise type of halo around the core following back to the tail. The tail was impressive. It was a bluish and turquoise color but what was unique, it had two tails of smimilar thickness and length. It was at about 50 degrees above my visible horizon and pased very quickly from east to west then faded like a regular run of the mill falling star. It seemed to be closer to the earth with more of an arc in it's flight trajectory. Size about a dime at arms lentgh. What really struck me was it's beauty as it passed. When we got to our destination I asked the driver in the lead truck if he had seen it, He got a bit enthusiastic about it and remarked on the brillinace and the many colors and stated it was kinda pretty wans't it. The reason I decided to post this is i was listening to KOA in Denver and callers were calling in reporting an almost identical event this date some three days after my sighting. I do not blieve it was a UFO in the extraterrestrial sense but a metrorite or deorbiting satellite. I won't forget this one soon.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> small airplane like, light, all of a sudden turn hugh and then speed off like a shooting star. It appeared to be an airplane. It looked like a star/ airplane lights- just the main ones, not the collored lights. I saw it in the sky to my left going east on hwy110. It got really bright as if it was coming my direction. All of a sudden it "blew up" to approximately 10-20 times the size. A second later it speed off to the right (going south) really fast. It was really high in the sky, I think. It at first looked like a comet, but I would have heard of it, they don't come that close to earth, and when it speed of it apeared to be a shooting star. I think it had a greenish tint to it when it moved, not when it "exploded" though. It all happened sort of fast, but I can not explain it. I have saw another ufo a year or so ago, but I did not report it. But I would really like to know if any one else saw it/ what it is.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  20 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> While picking up hay bales at night, I saw a triangular shaped object speed through the night sky. We had bales of hay to pick up on the ground, my father and I, and it was suppose to rain the following day so we went out at night with a tractor and wagon to pick them up. While there on a cloudless night a triangular shaped object sped across the sky from horizon to horizon at incredible speed. There was no sonic boom, no vapor trail we could see; no noise at all. We couldn't see the object itself, only three bright lights of different colors, maybe green and blue, which defined the shape as a very large triangle. There had been reports of an expected meteor shower that night, and at first we wondered if that is what we were seeing. But it flew to low to be meteors and there was no streaking affect like you usually see with those. Also, the color of the lights didn't change. We were speechless for we knew we had witnessed something highly unusual. For many years we talked about it. My father died in 1995. He had been in the military and was quite knowledgeable about planes. He was absolutely sure it was no terrestial aircraft, partly because of the color pattern he was. I am not quite sure of the year. It might have been a year or two sooner. I know I wasn't in high school yet. But I wanted to leave a record of this on file so at least someone would know it happened. The most important aspect of the sighting was the speed and size of the object. As far as I know, nothing can fly this fast through the atmospere without burning up. That's what I remember the most. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> During a latenight party a group of twenty witnessed a peculiar gathering of a fleet of pyramid shaped craft at midnight. Last month I was staying up late with some friends. I was having a latenight party at my house. We were in the middle of watching a movie, and we had the speakers cranked up high, when I began to hear a loud whumping noise, like the noise of a helicoptor. Startled, I jumped up and asked my brother to turn off the television. Startled himself at my anxious expression, he did. I heard clearly then, as well as the nineteen others piled in my living room, the noise outside. We scrambled out as fast as we could to see a small triangular craft above my house (small in comparison to large ones I've read about) . The craft was about the size of my house and in the shape of a triangular pyramid, but at that moment I could only see the bottom of it. I yelled at my brother to go get a camera (I had to yell because the noise soon became very loud) when the noise of the craft was accompanied by many more. We saw out of the sky a whole fleet of these craft come down by my house. There were probably twenty to twenty five ships in all. They stayed for a moment, got into some formation, and began to retreat back to the stars. I remember the noise that they made was deafening. There were no lights on the crafts until they got in formation. Then thin beams, like lasers, connected all the ships. They traveled off smoothly. We were so stunned we didn't tell anybody for weeks (who would believe us anyway?) . I live in a rural area and what few neighbors I did have were either out of town and didn't see the ships or they were at my party. My parents were on a week-long getaway and they couldn't testify either. Much of the group that were there won't talk about it now or just plain deny that it happened. But I know it happened, and I'm afraid. [NUFORC Note: We do not know whether the witness means the morning, or midnight, of 23OC00. We will attempt to clarify this point. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Dark object seen in early morning sky , vanishes. I was driving about 30 mph on a parkway on the very western edge of north Minneapolis. I was driving south, the moon was still visible at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the southwest and the sun had not yet come above the horizon but it was light out. A few degrees below the moon I saw a cigar shape, nearly black in color, with no lights. It seemed to be moving towards the west, it was hard to judge because I was in a moving car. As I drove I lost sight of it several times because of curves in the road, trees, and having to look at the road. In the first instance of regaining sight of it, it seemed to have a more triangular shape but still no lights. It was moving very slowly, if at all, and seemed very high in the sky. As I passed a tree it vanished. I stopped for a minute or so, to try to find it again, I did not see it anywhere in the sky. It had acctually vanished in a split second. There were no planes or helicopters that I could see, either.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A stationary red light accerated incredibly fast and changed to orange color and traveled away at a high rate of speedMy wife and I were driving North on U. S. Highway 53 about one mile from Cotton, MN, when we noticed an unfamiliar stationary red light near a radio communications tower which is about one quarter mile from the highway. We slowed down and then stopped along side the highway about one half mile after initally spotting the light to get a better look. The light was a steady red color like the top light on the communications tower except there were fainter secondary lights. The unknown light was somewhat further from the highway and appeared to be about twice as big. Upon stopping and watching for a few seconds the object accelerated incredibly fast to the South at very high rate of speed changing from a steady red to a blinking orange light with dimmer secondary lights of red and white. The object traveled a distance of two or three miles in a matter of a few seconds and shortly after disappeared from sight.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangular UFO in EARLY 1980&#39;s. . . Dear Mr. Davenport, . . . At your request as heard on the ART BELL radio program on 2/5/01, I am sending you MY UFO story. . . IT IS TRUE. . . I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but I AM POSITIVE it was in the EARLY 1980&#39;S. . . My best friend and I, in our early 20&#39;s at the time, decided to go &quot;Back-Roading&quot; on a clear Summer, weekday night around 10:30 PM. . . We were out driving the country roads surrounding Red Wing, MN. , traveling East in the vicinity of Whiterock, MN. when I, (The Passenger) , saw an unusually bright light, approximately 500-1000 Ft. Up &amp; 1-2 Miles North of us, that seemed to be moving South VERY slowly. . . We pulled off to the side of the road, turned OFF the engine, and got out of the car to get a better look. . . The &quot;Object &quot; was now almost directly above us and STATIONARY &amp; the bright light was now gone. . . We listened, but could hear NO SOUND at all coming from it. . . It appeared to be TRIANGULAR and very dark, If not Black. . . (Please Read On) . . . I took some small binoculars out of the glove box and looked at the object closer. . . I SAW a definite TRIANGULAR shape, but slightly angled inwards at the back, like the back end of an arrowhead. . . I also saw 5 LIGHTS on the Bottom of the object. . . Each a DIFFERENT COLOR, arranged in a CIRCLE, with the lights placed at points as the points of a star shape would be within a circle. . . The lights did NOT blink or fade On &amp; Off. . . I don&#39;t know what this thing was, but I DO know what it WAS&#39;NT. . . A Plane OR a Helicopter. . . It just stayed there in the sky STATIONARY for approximately 5 MINUTES, and then SLOWLY moved Northwest. . . We got back in the car and followed it at about 10-20 MPH. . . to 40-50 MPH. . . Then to 80-90 MPH. . . It still outpaced us moving off Northwest untill within 30 seconds or so, it could not be seen. . . We slowed down &amp; went back home feeling Thrilled, Spooked, &amp; Thoroughly Mystified. . . We told only our close friends &amp; family about the sighting, fearing ridicule, and went on with life having no answers on the subject. . . Within a week we were busy trying to convince ourselves it HAD to be a plane or a helicopter, and we were starting to believe our excuses. . . A week after that, on the FRONT PAGE of our local newspaper, the Red Wing REPUBLICAN EAGLE, were sketches of the very object we had seen 2 weeks before. . . Apparently several eyewitnesses had seen this object floating at tree top level at various spots in an around Red Wing, MN. where we live. . . Needless to say, that ended our excuses. . . But, to this day I am sill left without answers. . . As I said, this sighting happened in the EARLY 1980&#39;s, and with a little help from our local newspaper, mabey you could get the exact date. . . Or they might still have the newspaper archived. . . Also, mabey ART BELL would be interested in this TRUE Story. . . ?? Feel free to forward it to him if you like. . . Thanks for listening &amp; the IMPORTANT job you do!!<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> BRASS UPSIDE DOWN CUP AND SAUCER. GREEN AND WHITE LIGHTS. ANIMATED OBJECTS MOVING ABOUT. BUSINESS -LIKE. THIS WAS 1/2 HOUR FROM CANADIAN BORDER. VISITING DAUGHTER. WATCHING TV. GRANDDAUGHTER NOTICED BRIGHT LIGHT. 1:00 AM -20 BELOW. WENT OUT ONTO DECK, SON-IN-LAW IS AIR CONTROLLER, AND AT AIRPORT, SO MY DAUGHTER DECIDED TO GET OUT THE HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPE. FREEZING COLD, SO OUR HANDS KEPT SHAKING. ALL THREE OF US TRIED IN VAIN TO GET IT TO FOCUS (COULD NOT GET TRIPOD ASSEMBLED) TOO COLD. WE ALL TOOK TURNS. SUDDENLY I WAS ABLE TO FOCUS IT FOR PROBABLY TEN SECONDS OR SO, JUST INSTANTLY LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT I SAW. MY KNEES WERE SHAKING IN DISBELIEF. BRIEFLY, I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE, AN "ALL BRASS" UPSIDE DOWN CUP AND SAUCER, WITH THE CUP-PART BEING THE TOP OF THIS THING. ALL OBLONGED-SHAPED WINDOWS, ALL UNIFORM IN SIZE. A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN SIDE OF OBJECTS (BEINGS) ALL SAME SIZE SCURRYING RAPIDLY IN MOVEMENT. VERY BRIGHT INSIDE. THEY WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. THE 'UPSIDE DOWN" CUP AND SAUCER WAS, WHAT LOOKED LIKE, ALL BRASS, WITH BRIGHT GREEN AND WHITE LIGHTS REVOLVING AROUND IT. THIS WAS ONLY FOR A BRIEF TEN SECONDS OR SO, SO INSTANTLY IN MY MIND, I KNEW I HAD TO ABSORB AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. MY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THESE "OBJECTS" ANIMATED SCURRYING AROUND BY THESE CREATURES?. . . HAD SOMETHING TO ACCOMPLISH. THEY LOOKED MORE ANIMATED THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN, AND FRANKLY, ANYTHING I WOULD CARE TO SEE AGAIN. MY KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS AFTERWARD. IT WAS EXTREMELY SHOCKING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, IN ABSOLTE AWE OF WHAT I WAS SEEING. WE COULD NOT HOLD THE TELESCOPIC LENS STILL, SO IT WAS ONLY A BRIEF INTERLUDE, ALSO, IT WAS BITTER COLD. I KNOW WHAT I SAW, AND I SAW IT. I AM A MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTIONIST, OF SOUND MIND, MY DAUGHTER IS A SURGICAL NURSE AND OF COURSE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT. MY SON-IN-LAW BEING AN AIR CONTROLLER, ALSO HAS ASTROLOGY AS HIS HOBBY, AS HE, ALSO, HAS REPORTED SIGHTING AT THE TOWER AND RADIOED TO CANADA IF THEY HAVE ANY UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT COMING INTO AIRPORT FOR A LAND, ONLY TO HAVE THEM! SAY, NO . . . . WE HAVE NONE. THE TELESCOPE THE THREE OF US WERE STRUGGLING WITH THAT BELOW ZERO BITTER COLD NIGHT, WAS OF THE BEST SOPHISTICATION. I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TELL SOMEONE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT THIS, OTHER THAN US THREE. WE TALK OF IT OFTEN, AND JUST BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER, AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A GO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTSIDE OF THIS. A RICH, HIGHLY POLISHED-LOOKING BRASS. AMAZING. I THINK EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON IN THIS WORLD, AND I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE BY GOD ABOVE, THAT I SEE THIS. LIKE I SAID, WHEN WE WENT INSIDE, MY KNEES SHOOK AND MY HANDS TREMBLED FOR A GOOD COUPLE OF HOURS. IT WAS AMAZING, AND MAGNIFICENT. I SAID TO MYSELF, HOW GLAD I WAS THAT IT WAS STAYING UP THERE WE WATCHED THIS OBJECT FOR A DOOD HOUR AFTER THAT, COULD NOT GET TELESCOPE TO FOCUS AGAIN, NATURALLY. . . . . THEN, WHEN IT DEPARTED, IT SEEMED THAT THE LIGHTS JUST, SIMPLY, FADED, THEN DIMMEND, THEN NONOTHING. VERY AWESOME, I HAVE TO ADMIT. THE LITTLE "BEINGS" I. E. , CREATURES, WHAT EVER THEY WERE/ARE, WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE AND MY INSTANT IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY ARENT'T VERY BIG. THE WINDOWS WERE MORE OF AN OBLONG SHAPE, AS OPPOSSED TO A PERFECT, CHUNKY-LOOKING SQUARE. I HOPE I HAVE BEEN OF HELP. THANK YOU FOR THIS WEB SITE. I FEEL NOW, I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE, BUT IT REALLY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SUDDENLY SAY TO SOMEONE, OH, BY THE WAY, I SAW THIS OBJECT UP IN THE SKY, ETC. . . . . . . . . . THEY WOULD BE GOING. . . HO-HUM. . . . YEAH, RIGHT. T THANK YOU. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. We suspect witness has in mind astronomy, not astrology. PD]<br>

They didn't have any kind of remote starter mechanism either. I got in the car to try and figure out what was wrong and about 30 seconds later my friend's told me to get out of the truck NOW. I got out because they actually sounded serious. I looked up and saw three bright lights about 150 yards up. It was dark out so I'm not sure it was that high. It didn't make a sound AT ALL. The ovalish shaped object didn't do anything to us. It was dead quiet and the small breeze seemed to stop on its own. It hovered above us not doing anything for about 45 seconds to a minute. Then it just took off. The truck started right up too. We booked out of there like nothing else.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> two triangular crafts emitting a blue-silver light that "danced" in the sky before zooming eastward. I had just been dropped off by a freind after going to perkins after a concert, and i was hanging out outside because the moon was really bright and pretty. we have chairs out by our detatched garage, and they face east. I sat out for a few minutes, but decided to go in because of the cold MN temperatures. On my way back into the house, i noticed a brightness coming from behind me. I thought it may have been my neighbor's motion-activated floodlights, but when i turned around, the lights were off. The neighbor to the east's horses were also riled up. i coudl hear them running around and making noise. When i brought my eyes to the sky, i saw two triangular shaped glowing objects. there was definately light coming from them, but not from any specific source. It was more as if the craft itself emitted the glow. They zoomed southward across the sky, encircling each other, then zoomed away further into the east. They were not so much a color as they were a light. But if there is any color they'd be, i'd say a silver, blueish color. i can't say for sure how big they were, seeing as they were far away. Definately bigger than any car or bus, though, i'd say. And maybe it was because i was so fixated on them, but for some reason, when i saw them, the cold air seemed to dissappear.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 7 UFOs flying in a train formation seen in Northfield MN, 1991I have created a Flash animation of this experience: http://www. [URL deleted] In 1991 I was a senior at St. Olaf college in Northfield, MN. The following was witnessed by me, and at least 4 of my friends. The event occured in April or perhaps May of 1991. I was dark but it hadn't been dark very long. I'd guess it was 9:00. A group of us were in my friends apartment (Lincoln Parkway apartments) when one of my friends called us out to the second story balcony of the apartment. "hey guys check this out. . are these UFO's or something?" We went out of the desk and there were several lights about 40-45 degrees above the horizon (from our perspective) . . These lights were moving fairly slowly in our general direction. . as them moved closes they seemed to be following each other, one after the other. . I would call it a "string" of lights. . there were 7 or maybe 8 of them. I'm almost certain that these lights were moving independantly of each other and were not part of a single, huge object. The lights were a deep, amber red. I'm fairly certain the red lights were on continually and were bright. In addition, each "craft" also had what I remember to be several strobes blinking in a repeating, irregular, odd pattern not like the once every 3 second strobes of an airplane. the repeating strobe pattern (of maybe seven individual blinks) that each craft had repeated I would guess every second or so. I got the impression that these lights were fairly close to us. . and the size of each was maybe the size of a small plane. (20 feet diameter each?) I didn't notice any sounds from these lights. I actually got the cordless phone and called my roomate (who was in my apartment in the next building) and told him to go out on the balcony and look at what we were seeing. . I asked him what he thought they were and he said "I don't know, a train??" which was obviously not the case because trains don't fly, and these things were definitely in the air. But the lights were "train like" with one following the other blinking their weird lights. The distance between these lights in this string was not far. They seems to be much closer together than what I would think to be a safe distance. A couple years later I noticed a formation of helicopters flying, one after the other, and I took note that the distance between the helicopters was much farther apart than the lights that we say. Actually, I do remember that the noise of a train going by on nearby track was audible at the time. this may have also been what caused my friend to give "train" as an explaination. If there were any sound of the craft, the train noise may have gotten in the way of us hearing anything) . But had it been 6 Cesnas that close, I'm certain I would have heard the engines. Still watching the lights, I called the police on the phone I was holding. the woman who answered said "Oh, you know what those are? they're ultralight aircraft". This I doubted. I had seen ultralight aircraft in the area before. But never to my knowledge at night, and never flying in formation. The crazy blinking pattern of these lights was unlike anything I had seen on any airplane before. Seeing one of these things would have been curious, but It's possible that I may have just dismissed it as a plane that had odd lights but I doubt it. These lights were weird, and there were 6 or seven of them! Interestingly, the police-woman I was talking to told me that in a neary by town (Fairbault) there had been a newspaper story of some UFO sightings a week or so previous to the night I was talking to her. (more about this later) . The lights continued closer and closer to us and seemed to get lower. Slowly, the lights drifted past us to our left and from our perspective they disappeared along the tree line. After the initial string of lights disappeard to our left, 3-5 minutes past and then we looked up and saw another single craft appear in the some location in the sky that the initial group appeared. It moves slowly along, following the path that the other lights took. I seem to remember this one being slightly different. I believe it was smaller, but perhaps it wasn't. It had similar red lights and blinking strobes. The entire sighting lasted about 8 minutes. I later regretted not getting out of the building and going out in the field past the trees to see if I could continue to see the lights, but to be honest, I was scared. The next day I called the Fairbault newspaper and asked about the article that had been printed. The reporter verified that he had in fact written an article that discussed a couple of sightings in that area. I believe he mentioned that someone had seen a strange light shining a beam down or something like that. He also mentioned that a local farmer farmer had apparantly also had a sighting around the same time as us. This farmer had had sightings in years past and even had experienced cattle mutilations. The reported took my name and we talked about him possibly writing a new story talking about our sightings, but I didn't pursue it and neither did he so nothing ever happened. I also called the FAA and not surprisingly they weren't helpful. The 1997 "Phoenix Lights" reminded me somewhat of what we saw, how the lights appeared in a row. But the lights in that video seemed white, not red, and didn't appear to be moving. The lights we saw were much closer to each other (and to us) than the lights in the Phoenix videos that were widely shown. I know this report lacks certain important information (exact time, date) but I've done the best I can. What I do know is that these were definitely, without question, intelligently controlled craft, not balls of light way off in the distance. These lights were close and sharp and had it been daylight, I'm certain I could describe the shape of these craft, but it was just dark enough that we could only see the lights of the craft, not the shape of the crafts they were attached to. If these craft were man made, they were unlike anything any of the five of us ever recall seeing before or since. This string of lights was moving roughly in an east to west path.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> "Chrome" ball over the cliffs of St. PaulI was watching a band playing at the Taste of Minnesota at the State Capitol. I like to watch people, so I started watching the crowd. I noticed what I thought was a water tower or the top of a very tall parking lot light sitting over the cliffs to the east. The cliffs were about 2-3 miles away. The object sat just above the horizon of the cliffs. It looked like it was made of shiny metal, like chrome. As I said, I thought it was a water tower or light, but I couldn't see any support pole of any kind. It was a bright, clear, and sunny day. I continued to stare at the object waiting for my eyes to resolve the support pole. After about 35-40 seconds, I looked back at the band (I was tired of looking at what I thought was a water tower) . After about 5 more seconds, I looked back at the cliffs, but it was gone. I never shifted my feet and the area of the sky I could see was very small (about 5 degrees side to side, and about 2 degrees top to bottom) because of the trees framing the top. I had to be looking at the same area of the sky. I moved my upper body back and forth, and up and down to find the object again, but it was not there. I walked around to the other side of crowd so I could see more of the sky, but could not find a water tower or light. The object had simply disapeared.<br>

The lights seemed to be racing eachother, but in a hurry to get to a destination. We watched them move quickly then pause then quickly again and then they disappeared. Approximately 5 minutes later, we saw three lights holding formation of a triangle, but clearly they were three seperate lights moving with the same speed and manuverability as the two we saw beforehand. We aren't sure that there were only three, but they seemed to be the same so we assume there was one light (vessel) the other two needed to get. . .

The images each speak for themselves, except for the last image. It shows something quite different on "Night Shot" IR light, that spans IR light for about 10 feet, that is of course invisable to the human eye. Check out the last IR image because it says alot, and this image preceeded a beautiful low flying light that unknown to me at the time and just noticed was captured on my 8m/m Sony camcorder. I have not yet put this sequence of video freeze images on my tiny site. Of course, If there was a particular picture that you were curious about, ie: if it was faked or hoaxed etc. and I totally understand, and have no problem with loaning out some of the 8m/m original film cassettes if you were interested to study. I have so much crazy stuff in my video archive. Thankyou in advance for checking it out. [NUFORC Note: We have visited the site and viewed the photos posted there. The objects appear to be anomalous and unidentifiable to us. However, we do not have any specific reason to believe that they definitely are bona fide UFO's. One photo has the appearance of being that of a white dove or pigeon with its wings extended and tail spread, as if it could be landing, but that is only an impression. We are not aware of other dramatic reports from this area for this date. PD]<br>

[name deleted] was trucking along hwy 59 south in minnesota near the town of mohomen? he was not sure how to spell the name of the town, (mohomen) . it was about 01:35 to 01:45 when he observed a streak of light going across the ground then up into the tree line. (looked like it was going to crash into the trees.) then it hovered over the trees about 150 -200 feet away. the object appeared to be observing him, [name deleted] rolled down his window of his rig (truck) and stuck his head out, he was watching it and there was no noise whatsoever. he was amazed of what he was seeing. he looked directly at it when it just suddenly shot straight up into the sky. he was still watching it when it just dissapeard instantly like turning off a light switch. the entire ordeal took about a minute to a minute and a half. He discribed the object as follows. . . . . . . . a black smooth surface object about 35-50 feet in diameter, in the centre of the object it looked like there was 4 to 6 feet of glass and it was light up with a pulsating gold light. the very top of the object was a red light on a pole, the light was 3 to 4 feet wide on the top of the pole. on the very bottom of the object it was chrome in colour. I have been best friends with this man that has wittnessed this sighting and i personally believe his story. he is a man in his late 50's and does not drink or take drugs. [NUFORC Note: Mahnomen, MN, is located in the White Earth Indian Reservation, in Mahnomen County, midway between Grand Forks, ND, Fargo, ND, and Bemidji, MN. I have visited Mahnomen on several occasions, and I know the airport that the report alludes to. PD][NUFORC Note #2: We have spoken with the witness, and we found his description of his sighting to be quite interesting. The witness sounds to be credible, and he seems quite serious in his description of the alleged events He reported the alleged sighting to a law enforcement organization approximately two weeks after the event, and he photographed the site. We have spoken to the deputy sheriff, who confirms his conversation with the witness. PD][ADDENDUM--TEXT OF WITNESS REPORT MAILED TO NUFORC]"The night of March 28, 2001, at about 0ne forty five in the morning, I was southbound on hwy. 59, south of Mahnomen, MN, and I observed a flying saucer come off the ground and into the air. I couldn't believe what I was watching. It took about one, or one and a half, minutes to take off. It took off like turning a lite off and on. The other amazing thing about this is I returned to this same area on April 10, 2001, about 13 days later. I reported this encounter with the local sheriff's department. I got permission from him to go out and take some photographs. I took about 12 to 14 snap shots of the area. I was annoyed when none of the pictures turned out. Today is of great concern about the area, as I think the area should be checked by professional people to make sure (the) area is safe, as this is a large farm area. I wrote this on April 24, 2001, at 1500 hrs. , and I still have concerns about the area. Yours Truly Mr. (name deleted] P. S. --I don't have a problem taking a lie detector test about this.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> About two weeks ago my wife and I (living in Stillwater, MN) were driving to our new apartment. In fact it was the first night we were to stay here. Anyway, driving east I look out the passenger side window right beside me while my wife was driving and looking forward. I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing. As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask "What is that?" We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this. To say the least this was the weirdest thing either of us have ever experienced. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates a date of 03AP01, but subsequent investigation report suggests a date of 01AP01. We have amended the date here, until we receive confirmation.

The sky was still black when we saw a white light, brighter than an aircraft and about as bright as some of the night stars moving very fast from west to east. It moved in a horizontal line and did not appear to be a meteor etc. , which I have seen bounce across the atmosphere as it moved across the horiz. It moved much faster than we were going (575 kts) and was much higher than an aircraft could fly. I was only visual on it for about 1 min. at the most and the Co-Pilot said he saw it a bit before I noticed it. What brought my attention to it was another airline pilot pointing it out to the Air Traffic control center and asking if they had any high altitude fast movers? They said NO. I called and told the other airline pilot and center that we aslo had the object in sight. That is it.

Reports from commercial airliner crews are more precious to us than 3 oz. gold nuggets lying in a stream bed. . . What FAA facility was handling your flight at the time of the sighting, please? I would like to request the audio from the FAA through a Freedom of Information request, and it helps to be able to direct it tothe appropriate Center. I suspect it may have been Minneapolis Center, but confirmation of thatwould be helpful. Also, can you share what your call sign was at the time? That helps the FAA do the search, and go right to the radio communication with certainty that they have the right audio cuts. We will not release the name of your company, of course, in our written material.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> blueish/orange football size object over fishing spot- no soundI was fishing with my two brothers in Minn/Canada Boundary Waters. We have been to this camping site numerous times. The sky was very clear and weather was ideal. I was up late watching the fire and putting it out. I saw another group of people camping across the lake at another site. They were loud making some noise for the 4th of July. My brothers and I went to bed and they asked if I put out the fire. I comfirmed but was worried about embers. I walked outside and saw a blueish /orange football size light in the air. I looked at it for a minute and it started moving toward our island. I woke and called out my brothers. One came out side and watched the object move with me. I thought the other campsite my be shooting off some fireworks- at this time, the other campers, were quiet. The object moved closer and erraticly- not like a roman candle. The object moved toward us 100yards and my brother and I were getting scared. We were yelling look at that and asking each other what it could be. Then it moved real close and we moved inside the tent. My oldest brother called (who remained inside the tent) called us idiots who needed to go to bed. Well my other brother and I peaked out the front and the blueish/orange football size object move along the side of the island and down to the lake side. I got up and my brothers followed me. I went toward the side of the lake the object moved and saw nothing. Weird!!! In the lake ? Still do not know to date what that could have been. I am a scientist today and would not believe it unless I have saw it for myself.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two white lights, one infront of the other flying at the same ROS from West to East on 7/22/01 between 3 -3:30 am. no sound, no strobes. This set of lights where traveling in an East/NorthEast Direction Between 3and 3:30 am. Sunday morning. The brite white lights were situated one infront of the other. I first thought that maybe they were satellites. But they seemed much closer and larger in size than a a typical satelite. They were a continuous white light, no strobes or colors. However, there did seem to be a beam of light out infront of the leading light. This also was just a white beam. It was very still and quiet outside at the time of this sighting and I could not hear any sound that indicated any type of aircraft. Theonly way I can tell you distance between the two lights is if you were to see the lights, hold our hand streight out at arms length away and fill the space between the lights using your fingers. It was about two fingers to fill that gap. If that tells ya anything whatsoever?The one charactoristic that it did have equal to that of a satellite is that as it moved Eastword, the intensity of the light changed. As if to say it wasnt reflecting as much light as it was when it was overhead. Could this have been the space shuttle and station? My back was to the south, and I was looking north as it passed from west to east.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Twelve star-like objects viewed in random patterns over St. Paul, MinnesotaI have been spotting Chemtrails, the last three years. In my line of work, I am able to watch the entire metro skies from the roof of the heating plant , where I'm employed. At 0330 this morning, I began looking for high altitute aircraft and weather patterns. My first observation was what looked like a satellite. It was moving slowly from Northwest to Southeast. I watched it's straight line path until it was out of sight . I then turned around to view west again and I saw a bright star-like object, traveling from west to east . It was to my north and as bright as Saturn. It was not an airplane. It had no flashing lights. It appeared lower and larger than the satellite I had just seen, but higher than the hazy cloud patterns present. I was so amazed at this object and was semi- scared by it's appearance. Suddenly there was another object right behind the first. As if they were flying in formation. Both objects were on the same course and speed. The first object was brighter than the second and I watched them disappear in the eastern sky. I have been in the military during Viet Nam and spent my entire life around airplanes. Never have I seen such craft. I sat down and was in semi-shock trying to measure what I had just seen. Then I noticed another satellite object coming towards me from the north. I watched it, until it vanished overhead. (no cloulds near) After straining to see where it might have gone, a small red flash appeared. I'm thinking to myself now and wondering just what is going on. . . I radioed down to my work partner, to get upstairs and see the show that was going on. He arrived in two minutes and I explained my observations. He also has seen these on occasion and the couple he has observed didn't always move in a straight line but eratic patterns. We both began watching now and within two minutes I noticed another bright satellite object moving towards us from the west. I pointed it out to him and he caught sight of it, also. Then this object faded from a very bright light to nothing, r! ight abo ve us. Within less than an a hour, 12 objects were seen until cloud cover and the brightening sunrise took over.<br>

I was in a canoe with two others. We saw everything. The other canoers saw nothing. Strange. . . We were on a summer canoe trip in the Boundary Water Wilderness Area of Northern Minnesota. We got up around 3 am that day to paddle in the moonlight. We left at 3:30 AM. About half an hour in, I and my two canoe mates (3 to a canoe) saw something in the north sky. Actually it started being visible (or maybe we just saw it for the first time) when it was very close the the big dipper. It was a blinking light in the sky. Moving at a steady pace for the first few moments. For the 1st few moments we just brushed it off as an airplane (it looked alot like an airplane would at night) but it was kind of strange--Since when do airplanes fly over Ely, Minnesota? It is the middle of nowhere! OK, maybe we could pass this off as an aiplane taking an alternate route to get to San Fransisco or somewhere. But this was before the spectactle that turned my friend into a believer in UFO&#39;s and the like. The whole sighting lasted oh no more than 2 minutes and it looked just like a plane going thru the sky for about a minute of the two, blinking and moving steadily. But then all of a sudden it lit up (it stopped blinking and got visibly brighter) , and then went extremely fast and went out of sight. We were all awestruck<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> large boeing 747 followed by two smaller craft. I was helping a friend of mine built a shed, we were talking when four airplanes flew low over our heads. Once they passed I noticed a Boeing 747 higher in the sky traveling east to west. What was strange was the two smaller planes following the large 747. At first I thought the smaller planes were escorts (like maybe it was the President's plane with two fighter escorts) But the smaller planes were both on the left side of the 747. They were dark in color but surrounded by a translucent cirle. by Then the 747 started to turn south and the two smaller planes did an ariel loop-de-loop and ended up behind the 747. Then the two smaller planes sped off so fast I couldn't tell in what direction they traveled. I kept asking my friend if he could see the two small planes. We both concluded that the two smaller planes had vanished. We could still see the 747.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangular shaped ufo which darted quickly across the sky near duluth MN, but then remained stationary for a half hour. . . . . Myself and a friend were heading home from the barnum fair towards our hometown 20 miles south west of duluth when we noticed a bright light in the east/southeastern sky. My friend thought it was venus, but it seemed so large and bright, and it seemed to be lower than most stars and the only star in the direction! I thought it was the north star but realized we were facing east. As we were about to dismiss the object as a star or planet, it suddenly darted left (straight north) for about 3 seconds but seemed to cover a lot of ground in that short time. We lost sight of it but then turned left as it was the road towards home anyways. We passed some pines that blocked our view but then came to an open field and saw the bright object again. It was hovering but then moved upwards quickly and the light totally went out, then came back on again about 10 seconds later. The odd thing was it was a clear sky, every star was visible, so i figured it couldnt be a plane going through clouds, and the light seemed to large to just be a plane. We watched the object for another 10 miles, and decided to go just go home cause it was now higher in the sky. However when i got on my road i could still see the strange object, i tried to video tape it casue i had my camera in the car but the battery died about 3 seconds into taping it, so we went in my home got my dad and drove back west down my road. we stopped the vehicle got out and stared north northeast where the object was. It now was a brilliant blue and red, the lights would flicker much like that of a plane, but it hovered in the same spot for 30 more minutes!!! Plus i spotted a plane in the south western sky moving east, and it became clear the object was definately no plane. The strangest thing about it was that it also had 3 white lights, which if connected would make a triangle. but the triangle seemed to appear, then go away then come back once every 20 seconds or so. . we watched it until 11:15 and then decided to return home. This is the! strange st thing ive ever seen and i hope to see it again. [NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite credible and convincing. We questioned the fact that the witnesses had watched the object of interest for an estimated 1 hour, but he was adamant, and convincing, in his assertion that the object actually did what is described above.

PD] 01 April, 2001, Close Sighting of Large Triangular Object and Other Objects 1 of 2Date of Sighting: 01 April, 2001Date of report: 01 Dec. 2001. Investigator: Dean DeHarpporte, Minnesota MUFON Field Investigator. Time of Sighting: Final stages of dusk, nearly dark (~7:05 PM, 25 minutes after sunset) Weather conditions: Clear, light wind, temperature near 40 F. Sighting Duration: Witness 1, ~1 minute, Witness 2, ~1 minuteSighting Location: -2 miles north of Stillwater, Minnesota on highway 96, intersection with Highway 5. Type of Report: Witness 1, Close sighting of triangular object. Simultaneously, witness 2 saw several distant lights. Local Evaluation: Witness 1 UFO, CE1 Unexplained. Witness 2 possible CE1, probably airplane lights. Sighting background: The witnesses, a married couple, called the UFO reporting center on the night of the sighting and witness data was relayed to this investigator in October, 2001. The investigator interviewed the witnesses on 14 November, 2001 for one hour, He did not visit the site of the sighting due to lack of enthusiasm to do so by the witnesses. Each of the 2 witnesses observed different UFOs. It is possible, but not likely, that they were related, since they were several miles apart and their appearance differed radically. Witness Description:Witness 1. Male, age middle 30s. Occupation: works at assembly plant in Stillwater. He was strongly impressed by the sighting and talked about “nothing else” that night with witness 2, his wife. However, he was not traumatized. He has not spoken about the sighting except for a few people close to him until the interview with the investigator. No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. Witness was in good health with good eyesight. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before his sighting. Witness 2. Female, age early-middle 30s, wife of Witness 1. Works in local area. Witness is apparently in good physical condition. Eyesight, hearing are good. Witness was excited about the sighting (even 6 months later) but did not describe any symptoms of trauma. No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before her sighting. She has done some reading after the sighting. Sighting Account. The witnesses were driving east on Rt. 96 near the intersection with highway 5 in a rural area 1-2 miles north of Stillwater, MN (~22 miles east of St. Paul.) The landscape is gently rolling comprised of crop fields and wooded areas. It was nearly dark, but some light remained in the sky, which was clear. Witness 1, Object description. . Sitting on the passenger side of the car the witnesses were traveling in, witness 1 noticed a lighted, triangular object to his right. The object appeared to be about 250 ft on a side. The witness reported the triangle was equalateral, though his (inexact) drawing shows it as isosceles. It was not possible to discern a texture to the surface of the object. A bright white light was at each apex of the triangle underneath the craft. The lights were not bright enough to illuminate the ground beneath the craft. There was also a red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle, less bright than the white lights, which blinked about once per second. There were no other lights on the object and no windows, orifices or other surface features were visible. The color of the object was black, but not the same color as the stealth aircraft. The object produced no sound, although the witness did not get out of the car. No other witnesses are known to have observed the object. Position, movement and duration. The nearest surface of the object was approximately at a 60 degree angle from the ground when the craft was at its lowest altitude. When first seen the object was about 400 ft above ground but moved down “quite rapidly” to about 150 ft and hovered for several seconds, then rose up to about 400 ft. There was no apparent lateral motion of the object. The car was moving about 45 mph but slowed to 10-15 mph immediately upon sighting of the object. The object was last seen to the rear of the car and disappeared when the car got too far away for the witness to see it. The duration of the sighting was about 1 minute. Witness 2, the driver, did not see the object because she was concentrating on driving. Drawing of object. When he came home the witness made drawing of the object (Fig. 1) which looked substantially the same as the drawing he made during the investigation. The original drawing was lost. After the sighting, he read some UFO literature, including accounts of the triangular objects seen in Belgium in the early 90s. as shown in Figure 1. 2 of 2Figure 1. Object viewed from below at its lowest altitude. Sighting evaluation: CE1. The object described is similar to the description of many triangular objects seen worldwide for the past 20 years. There is no conventional explanation apart from the possibility that the craft was an advanced military aircraft. However, current known technology is not consistent with a craft capable of hovering and moving rapidly vertically upward and downward without engine noise. Witness 2 Object description. Witness 2 observed two white lights, separated by the width of her thumb at arms length directly in front of her (toward the east) . The lights were estimated to be 15 miles away (though she emphasized the uncertainty of this estimate) , and were seen at the same time as witness 1 observed the triangular object to his right. Witness 1 also observed the two lights, but not closely, since he was occupied with observing the triangular object to his right. Witness 2 estimated the size of the lights to be about 1/8th the diameter of the moon and the brightness as brighter than a streetlight. Based on the inverse square law, this would mean the lights were more than 225 times the intrinsic brightness of a streetlight. As far as she could tell the object was not illuminating the ground. No other witnesses are known to have observed the lights. Position, movement, and duration. Witness 2 estimated that the object was about 20 degrees above the ground. This would make the altitude of the lights about 6 miles (~31, 000 ft) . The lights appeared motionless for about 1 minute, then moved downward rapidly until they disappeared below the tree-lined horizon about 3 seconds after they began their descent. The calculated speed of movement was 7200 mph. The lights disappeared at about the same time as witness 1 lost sight of the triangular object. The witnesses observed airplanes in the vicinity but witness 2 was adamant that the lights she saw were not conventional aircraft. The nearest airport is 9 miles to the southwest, 135 degrees to the right of (behind) the direction where the objects were sighted. There are no airports within at least 40 miles to the east of the sighting location. Additional lights. During the time the 2 lights were hovering, they emitted 2 smaller lights which circled downward and back up and joined with the primary light a few seconds after they appeared. The witness had no estimate of the speed of these lights and said they were not quite as bright as the primary lights. Sighting Evaluation: Probably conventional aircraft. If the object size was 1/8th the apparent diameter of the moon and 15 miles away, it would have been a very large object, indeed. At 225 times the brightness of a streetlight, it would also have been exceedingly bright. The downward speed of 7200 mph is also extraordinary. The lack of other witnesses or press coverage of such a remarkable object as well as the inexperience of the witness and the well known difficulty in judging distances of lights in the sky causes the investigator to believe that the lights were probably much closer than estimated and thus much smaller and less bright. Despite the lack of an airport in the direction of the sighting, the presence of a major airport, MSP, 30 miles west of the sighting causes the investigator to believe that the lights could very possibly have been attached to aircraft. However, there is not enough information to make an unambiguous judgment.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 5 Bronze colored, elliptical shaped objects in (&lt;) formation, travelling really fast from NW to SE on clear night. I saw 5 figures in a formation soar by last night. They were bronze in color, and elliptical in shape. Their sides came to a point, rather than just rounded. All looked to be the same size. The formation they were flying was similar to a Less Than sign (&lt;) . They were traveling from N. W. to S. E. , and being a pilot myself, I would guestemate around 40, 000 feet. The sky was clear. I watched them from about a 60 degree sky position from my right side, to about a 30 degree sky position on my left side. They flew virtually overhead. I saw no other lights, nothing flashing, just the steady bronze color. I heard no sounds from them, but at that altitude you probably wouldn&#39;t. There were no trailing streams of light coming from them. I know the Leonid Meteor shower has been going on, but with meteor showers, the light goes extremely fast, has a trail of light, and is generally really bright. These lights could not be meteors. There is not a great amount of military aircraft around here. The objects I saw were traveling quite fast. Probably 3 times as fast as an airliner in cruise. I&#39;m not sure how fast our military aircraft can go, but it was impressive whatever it was.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Minneapolis-two flashes of robin egg blue lightening behind clouds, leaving sky lit a little lighter in that area for 45 minutes after. While driving on 394W at 10:05pm, I saw what looked like robin egg blue lightening flash twice behind the clouds, lighting them up in the western sky. That area in the sky stayed lit for 45 minutes after. (this latter difference in sky color may have not too been noticable to anyone not looking for it) The lit part of the sky was a lighter color than the surrounding sky, with a tinge of blue. This happened during a heavy snow storm so it could have been lightening, but I've never seen bright blue lightening before, and that doesn't explain why that part of the sky stayed a little bit lit for at least 45 minutes later. . . the lit sky has returned to normal at last peek (11:15pm)<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  12/26/2001<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Rectangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  8 Minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 5/18/01 Minnesota sighting of unusual object which ejected at least 3 others before splitting in two and disappearing. My sister and I had just finished watching the Blues/Avalanche NHL playoff game on TV (which ended abruptly in overtime) and as I was frustrated that my team lost, I immediately proceeded to get ready to drive my sister home to St. Paul. She went outside ahead of me, while I grabbed a quick glass of water for the road. It was about 2134 CST on May 18, 2001. A few seconds later she yelled for me to hurry and take a look at something which was moving slowly almost directly overhead in the sky (which was clear) . I stepped out of the doorway and looked up. What we saw for the next 6 minutes is as follows: A large object almost directly overhead, slightly east of our position, which was at a point just west of Interstate 35W and just south of US Highway 10 in Mounds View, Minnesota, USA. As I have been trained in this area, I estimated this object to be at an altitude of somewhere between 8000 to 10000 feet. The object first appeared as an oddly shaped rectangle though roundish on the bottom, with a deep-orange seemingly pulsating or shimmering underbelly, similar to a liquid metal appearance, with what appeared to be brighter orange highlites (which appeared as possibly tubular openings) in the front end which I viewed just prior to it passing overhead, which then hid those frontal features. It also appeared to have a halo, or jellyfish type of bubble on the top of the object well above the shimmering orange bottom. It was moving very slowly from the east to the west/northwest, and made no sound, and no other lights of any kind were visible, though its general shape seemed to ebb as its orange underside was unstable as it was pulsating slowly. As this was something that I have never witnessed before, it seemed significant enough for me to dash inside to grab my video camera, and I was fortunate enough to tape nearly two minutes of this object. After taping this object for nearly a minute, I was surprised to see that another object seemed to be released from the main object and zip away from it fairly quickly, with this splitting visible in the frames prior to my nervous jerking of the camera to get a better angle as it was moving behind trees. Within seconds, the object released an additional two (possibly three) objects which are clearly visible on the tape. These objects seemed to fall in a downward motion though they could have been moving into the distance. One object is shown to fall off vertically behind trees while it suddenly reappears a second later moving horizontally and completely disappearing a few seconds later. This also is clearly visible. During this second release of smaller objects, there was no apparent change in the main object's structure, though it seemed with the naked eye to dim slightly after the release. About thirty seconds later, the main object then split into two major sections and the sped off in opposite trajectories from each other though in a seemingly downward motion in relation to the camera's angle, which was pointed upward at an approximate 45 degree angle in relation to the ground. The objects then disappeared from view behind trees. I have estimated that in relation to the camera's angular position, that this object split apart in the vicinity of Coon Rapids, Anoka, or Champlin, Minnesota, or in that general region, to the northwest of Mounds View. There were at least three witnesses from our location: myself, my twenty-year old sister, and my forty-nine year old then roommate, who only saw the object briefly. I yelled for another individual who had been entering his vehicle a half-block away to look, but the person either didn't understand or didn't fully hear me trying to get his attention. My personal credentials include military service in the United States Army as an MOS 16T10 (Patriot Missile) . As this is an Air Defense position, I was specifically trained to spot and identify all known types of aircraft and other flying objects (balloons, missiles, drones, military flares, meteorological phenomona, etc.) . Despite my background, I have no experience with the object I witnessed this particular evening. I can personally attest to the facts presented herein, and can faithfully presume that it was not an aircraft, nor a "shooting star" (meteorite) , nor a military flare, and certainly not a weather balloon (the wind was blowing from the west to east at about 10-15 mph yet the object was moving east to west/northwest -into the wind) . Additionally, the sun had already set, yet the object was luminescent or emitting its own light on the side not facing the sunset. At the same time that this object was sighted, I did notice a high-flying commercial jetliner that was flying from west to east at an approximate altitude of 36, 000 feet, and was visible from its exhaust contrail. In terms of its possible size, I would judge this object as it first appeared overhead to be the size of between a 747-400 and a C-5A military transport aircraft. The object certainly was well below the altitude of the high-flying commercial jet which was moving in the opposite direction. To describe its size in a simple form, if you basically stretched both arms over your head and put two thumbs (and possibly another half of one thumb) next to each other, that's the size it appeared at its closest point. I wanted to share this story with your investigators and the general public because I felt that it was significant enough to warrant further investigation to determine what the object could possibly have been, and as to whether there were other witnesses (which I have noticed that there was another sighting in the St. Paul, Minnesota suburb of Hastings about 2 hours previous to mine with a similar description) and if there have been other similar sightings with similar object behavioral characteristics. There has been some local investigation by the Minnesota MUFON network field investigator, and he is apparently still putting the finishing touches on his report. I am highly interested in knowing if your organization has connections to those who may have experience with video tapes, and who would be interested in examining the tape to determine the light source evident on it, and possibly enhancing the tape to show more detail. Thank you for your efforts regarding this. In closing, I would also like to share that within a few days of this sighting, I made attempts to get local media coverage of this sighting. Copies of the tape were made in the studios of KARE 11 (NBC affiliate) , WCCO 4 (CBS affiliate) , and KSTP 5 (ABC affiliate) . None of the organizations returned any information regarding the sighting for a possible story, which I find highly unusual. I also contacted the local air traffic control center, which is a major regional center located in Farmington, Minnesota. They told me to contact the control tower at MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul International) . I spoke to a supervisor (whose name I'll give if needed) there regarding possible radar tapes from that evening to see if an object was sighted, but was told a few days later that nothing unusual was on those tapes. I am also interested in what local television weather radar, NWS radar, and NOAA weather radar scans show for that specific time period on 18 May 01. Thank you once again.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Aurora type of craft seenThis is a bit late in reporting, but two men told me about a siting, that I am relaying to you. March 5, 2001, Duluth, Minnesota. 9:30 to 10 AM A large triangular craft, reported to be about 4 times the size of a stealth jet was seen while two men were driving north on Hwy. 53, thru the northern suburb of Hermantown, Minn. , next to Duluth. It was dark, but the color seemed to be a greyish, silvery color with a light on each corner and one in the center. The two men were traveling in a car, watching it. It had crossed the highway from the leftside, moving to the right. It was moving very slowly, almost hanging over the highway for a while. One of the men thought that it should be moving faster and be out of site when compared to commercial planes. It was fairly low in the sky, a little higher than treetop level, he thought about a block high. They pulled the car over to the side and stopped to listen. There was no sound coming from it. It continued drifting slowly until it went past a bunch of trees and then it suddenly either took off extremely fast or just disappeared. It was angling in the direction of the Duluth Air Force Base which has been officially closed for quite some time. (Although there is some activity, I think Air National Guard stuff happening there. There have been some fighter jet activity around there, since the Sept. ll attack.) The craft was triangluar shaped, except in the back it wasn't a straight line , like a true trianglar, but was indented some.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Observed was a black boomerang/triangle shaped going east at approximately 500 miles an hour with no lights on at all. On Thursday, November 15, 2001 at exactly 2100 my friend and I were standing on the balcony of the third and uppermost floor of his apartment building. I was smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars (The ground visibility was a little hazy, sky visibility was completely clear.) when I saw an object flying east almost directly overhead. It was shaped like a triangle, more so like a boomerang (my friend said like a giant glider.) It seemed to be about the same size across as a jetliner (without knowing exact altitude.) It was completely matte-black, not reflective at all, with no lights or beacons on it at all. It was darker than the night sky which was lit by streetlamps. It also made no sound at all, completely quiet. Its' rate of speed was comparable to a plane on landing approach, I believe. It flew over our heads at a 120 degree angle. The downtown St. Paul airport is approximately 3 miles away from our location. There were no planes in the direct area where I saw the object. When I first saw the craft I immediately stopped the inane conversation I was having with my friend and pointed out the object. He saw it immediately and we both watched it fly out of sight over the building. We were both completely flabbergasted. The whole event lasted between 8 and 10 seconds. My friend is a [deleted]l engineer and I am a [deleted] officer. We both went to college at the University of Wisconsin. We are in our mid-twenties. He is married, I am not.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> V-shaped pattern of faint reddish lightsMy two children and I had gone outside around 4 am to watch the meteor shower, and I would say it was about 20 minutes later that my 7 year old son pointed out a V-shaped pattern of faint reddish lights overhead, moving at about the speed one would expect to see a plane flying. While I believe I did hear what sounded like a plane engine very distantly, we are also near an Interstate highway, and the tractor-trailer engines have fooled me before, sounding very much like jet engines or small planes as they accelerate, and there was moderate freeway traffic at this time. At any rate, this pattern of lights seemed to be flying quite high, and unlike plane lights, these lights did not flicker or blink, but remained constant. I watched this pattern for about 2-3 minutes while it made frequent direction changes, very tight, smooth turns and I eventually lost track of it. [NUFORC Note: Date should be November 18.

<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 5 mi sighting of a soundless chevron craft with six lights as bright as those on a baseball field . While driving east on 10th street , I observed some very bright white lights high up in the sky. They appeared to be moving west toward the direction I was going. I at first thought it was a big commercial jet or military plane headed to the mpls. airport or the U. S. Airforce reserve base located next to the Mpls. airport. Then while observing these lights I could no longer tell if they were moving or hovering. There also appeared to be a smaller craft to the north of this big craft. I rolled down my drivers side window and guessed it may have been a helicopter but no sound could be heard. When my attention refocused on the other craft it appeared to be hovering over a grove of trees on manning. I could easily distinguish three bright ligets on either side of a chevron or perhaps a triangular shape. I could not tell which as I believe I was looking at it dead on. I than rolled down the passenger side window and slowed downto about 20 miles per hr expecting to hear some sound. I heard nothing. The six bright lights completely lit up the tops of the trees. They became baseball field bright. I stopped at the corner of manning and 10th street (its a four way stop) and noticed that two guys were working on a telephone line. (a Quest truck was parked there) Looking to my right I still could see the tree line lit up. I turned left to head home to Stillwater and looked at my rear view mirrior and coule still see the tree line lit up. I checked with the Washington County police Dept to see if anyone else had reported anything, but was told no. I also called Lake Elmo Airport and no reports were taken either. I'm pretty neutral about the ufo thing as I'm Catholic and pretty conservative on my view of such matters. I'm not scared about this but would like hear if others have seen something like this.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> object with trail behind it slowly moves across sky to north and then abruptly shoots off in its continuing direction to the north. I was driving south on a poorly lit sidestreet in St. Peter, giving me a good view of the clear night sky. I looked up to the south sky, and I saw what I had believed to be a meteor. I saw an orange light, but was unable to make out any definite shape. There was a trail behind it, much like you would see behind a comet. I knew it was not a meteor, because it was moving slowly from south to north. After about 5-10 seconds of this &quot;phenomenon&quot; moving slowly across the sky, it shot off in it&#39;s continuing direction towards the north. There was no sound emitted by the craft, nor any ensuing sonic boom. I got out of my car to get a better look, but by that time it was gone. I also noticed two airplanes passing by the area where the event had occurred. I have no knowledge as to what kind of aircraft they were, or whom they belonged to. I talked to several other people in the general vicinity whom had viewed the same event. We speculated what it may have been, and came up with a few things- possibly a fighter jet? A satellite re-entering the atmosphere? An experimental aircraft? We had exhausted the possiblilites, and then gave caution to the idea that it may very well have been an UFO.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Massive craft seen for an hourVisiting friends with mother at cabin on Hoodoo point - Lake Vermillion. Around midnight, took the 2 passenger paddle boat out about 50 feet from shore. Lots of stars. Saw what appeared to be several shooting stars, but they traveled too fast and to the right in the sky. Looked over, and down extremely low in the sky, so large and visible was a massive craft. Craft was stationary or "hovering". No sound. Craft's size was visible when it suddenly shot off a "beam" of white light which appeared around the craft like a halo. Top of craft had circling green and red lights, which appeared to go on and off in random type of pattern, but were circling around the top of the craft. Watched the craft for nearly an hour and a half, in shock for what we had seen. White halo light around craft came again, showing the massive size of craft, and the underside of craft and the details of make of ship. When craft suddenly "beemed" itself - suddenly it had moved to a spot to the right of where it had been, but without "moving" and went back, we paddled back to shore, and informed guests at cabin who went outside and also witnessed craft. Called the airforce base in Duluth then, who informed us we were the sixth caller that evening regarding the siting. [NUFORC Note: Witness describes self as a highly-trained professional.

<b>DURATION:</b>  1.5 hours<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> At 10 PM my wife observed a light in the southwestern sky that was odd because it was moving erratically. I joined her on the deck and saw a red and green light that were close together. I assumed it was an airplane, but it suddenly made a sharp movement to the side, then an up and movement. Now the side to side movement could resemble a very wide winged plane with the wing lights flashing alternatly. But this didn't explain the up and down movement. Also the light stayed in the same place, every so often jerking to one side or the other or up and down. I looked around and observed an identical light in the western sky with the same movements. We watched for about 1/2 hour and they stayed in the same position. My wife went to bed and I continued to read. At a little after 11 PM I went out to check and the light in the southwest was gone, but the western one was in the same position and still jerking around. I got my binoculars, hoping to see more but the light just was sharper. As I was watching two more of the same type lights appeared in the northwestern sky. These acted the same but also blinked off and then on every so often. After about another 1/2 hour these two lights suddenly moved at an extremely fast speed toward the western light and when they neared it they disappeared. Now these two lights seemed smaller or further away. When I went to bed an hour later the west light was still there. I can think of no logical explanation. All the light were red and green and seemed to be very close together.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> FORMATION OF DISKS SHOOT ACROSS THE SKY . I had just pulled into my driveway. And as I got off my van, I happened to glance up at the sky, right over my neighbors house. At that moment I saw about seven to nine lights shoot across the sky. The lights were amber in color and they weren't blinking, the lights were steady. They looked a little bigger than the brightest star. They seemed disk shaped. They were in a formation, two lines parallel to each other, but one line was one disk ahead of the other. About four or five seconds into the sighting, the last disk maneuvered its way to the front in what seemed a split second. I ran to the left side of my house as they dissapeared over my house. I caught sight of them again on the other side of my house, but only for a couple of seconds, then they disapeared behind some trees.<br>

I then noticed that the side of the tent that faced the wetlands and lake was lit up. I would like to tell everyone that it was no a light from a boat. The wetlands is inbetween my house and lake and it is about 150 yards wide and there is no way a light could have been that bright off a boat. I then saw what I truly believe to be a shadow of a torso and arm of an alien. I watched it for about thirty seconds and saw the fingers move in a manner that assured me that it was not a inatamate object being blown by the wind. I became frightened and hid in my sleeping bag. I do not know how long they were there but when I came out of my sleeping bag about an hour later the light was gone and so was the Alien.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large triangular space craft sighted above North Senior High School' football field, in North St. Paul, MN in early October 1, 1973My girlfriend and I were driving on the local highway that runs through the middle of our town, North St. Paul, MN, and were just coming near the high school's football field. Very obvious in the sky, just hovering over the football field was a large triangular spacecraft, at least as big as the field. It did not make any obvious sounds, but we were ina car on the highway, so that presents noise of its own. However, above that normal highway noise, there was nothing unusual. There were lights on each of the triangle tips. We stared in awe as we continued on the highway. Though I wanted to go to my house for a camera to take a photo, my friend was afraid to return to the spot. We did go to a nearby corner store and called police to report it. No one took us seriously at either the store or the police. We did not return to that location again that night. There were no reports in the paper about the sighting, though it seems apparent that others must have seen it also. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. One of two credible reports from same source.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Strobing Satellites ?Watching the sky on the shore of Northern Lake Superior for auroras &amp; satellites early Monday morning. Saw an early (just after sunset) bright satellite/iss…very nice. Also saw several shooting stars…very nice. As the night wore on and into the early hours of the morning, I saw a number of satellites/orbital objects. Characteristics: very very dim, some fading in and out. One object in particular caught my attention. A very dim satellite/object moving near the zenith (top) of my field of view, slowly dimming even more, then suddenly, a relatively weak strobe (bluish light, same color as object) , followed several seconds later by a very very bright strobe (astoundingly bright) , followed by perhaps another several strobes of various intervals/intensities. Object faded, and was very dim to begin with. I have seen beautiful satellites before which are apparently tumbling and reflecting the light back to me in the proper manner to give me a “light house” effect…that is a rare treat. But a strobing satellite ? Do some satellites come equipped w/ strobes ? My thinking is a military spy satellite with a given wavelength HID strobe where a high gain can be applied to that wavelength to amplify the illuminated image relatively free of noise. Another theory is just an ordinary function of satellites so a ground observer can do a quick and easy visual check to verify proper functioning of the satellite (in other words, just another cheap easy, fail safe check…why not) . My final theory is that it may be part of a function to freak out paranoid terrorists (and I DO HOPE it freaks them out!) . Any thoughts ? This is the second time I have seen this sort of thing. The first one I ever saw was just a bit after 9-11-01, and was observed over St. Paul, MN. Looked like a satellite, and then one HUGE strobe flash (brighter than the one I saw over the lake) . These objects all looked like satellites to me. Very dim, moving, tiny tiny stars, very difficult to see and follow. [NUFORC Note: We believe the first possibility to be ruled out would be tumbling boosters and space debris, which reflects sunlight in a pulsating fashion. Just a guess. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Space suit looking things and object in the woodsI was 15 at the time and I was outside by myself throwing bouncing a basketball while the rest of my family was inside the house. I had a weird feeling I was being watched. So I looked around and saw (the only way I can really describe it) is like a silver space suit type thing on the side of the house. But it was only there for one second. From where I was standing I could see both sides of the house. One second later it was on the other corner. Then back again. I don't know if there was several or if that one just moved faster than light. I wasn't afraid of them. I was scared because it was unknown to me. I started shaking and went into the house and never said a word to anyone in my family. When I walked in the front door I locked it and deadbolted it. I walked upstairs and saw my family all watching a T. V. show. I didn't say anything, because I thought they would think I was crazy. I went to the big patio door and locked that to. Then I went to take a shower. As I was in the shower, the house started to shake and I heard this loud noise. I hurried up and got out and threw my clothes on and ran into the living room. My dad was the only one there. I said "where is everyone", and he said outside watching a spaceship or something. I went running outside and my mother and brothers and sisters were watching this thing that they said had come out of our woods and shot to the sky so fast and was making this loud noise. All I could see was the dot way up in the sky. They said it shot out of the woods so fast you couldn't see what it was. At that time I told my mom my little story. I don't think she would have believed me, but she said she did because when they went to run outside they couldn't get the door open because I had locked all the locks. About a week later, my mom and dad were home alone and that same noise came back and the house started to shake and they lost electricity. Only some beams were shining down from an object in the sky which they couldn't see onto our patio.! Our hou se was on a cliff off a creek off the river. They said it hovered there for awhile with the lights than just went away. I was a paralegal for 10 years and now run a flooring business and business center with my husband. Its weird because it seems like after that happened, no one in my family, including myself, after talked about it. Its almost like you forget until years later. I have just recently in the last few years, told only a few people. And of course they just laugh at me. I do believe there are a lot of hoaxes out there, but I have to believe there is something, because I saw like silver suited, what I think were beings, and they couldn't have been from this planet, because they moved to fast in second intervals. So thats my story. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

We decided to follow it and came to a clearing, when we got to this spot they were both now in the Southeast sky. We continued to watch them and all the sudden they just started moving towards each other almost like they were going to collide with one another. They got so close to each other that we could only see one ball of light as they were passing each other. After they had passed each other, the one moving to the left all the sudden just dissappeared, it was there and then it started moving fast and then gone. The one moving the other way kept moving and all the sudden just stopped. It seemed as though it was circling a specific area and while it was doing this it would lift up and then drop and then move left or right. When we could just see the one it was changing colors from red to white to an almost glowing blue/green and it looked like it was spinning. We watched it for about 15-20 minutes and it just stayed in the same spot not moving anywhere, just lifing, decending, moving right/left and changing colors. We could not believe what we were seeing as we had never seen anything like it before. It couldn't have been a plane because planes do not look like they are going to collide and planes don't stay one spot for this long. We were in awe.<br>

Suddenly I saw 3 or 4 white dots, in a straight line, streak across the sky from west to east. The streaking white dots appeared to be at very high altitude and moving incredibly fast. Within in one to two seconds they had crossed the sky. My first impression were that they were high flying jets. It was hard to comprehend. . . to cross the sky that high that fast.

<b>APPROX LOCATION:</b>  Barnum, MN<br><br>
<b>SIGHTING:</b>  8/18/2001<br><br>
<b>REPORTED:</b>  9/13/2002<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Circle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> BRIGHT CIRCULAR UFO THAT HOVERS OVER CARLTON COUNTY MINNESOTAI was driving north east with a friend from the Barnum fair on a Sunday evening. We took the Mattawa exit from I35 and were headed due east. The road probably is about 3-5 miles long until it meets another paved road at an intersection. Anyways, we were both chatting about the fair and in a relaxed state, when I noticed due east in the sky above a large brilliant bright light. My friend assumed it was venus, but it looked so low and to big to me. I drove straight on the same road and we stared at it for about 2 miles straight. Then I stopped at the stop sign and was preparring to take a left as it is the route home, and just as I stopped the Circle began to move due north across the sky, it moved quicker than a plane, and was such a bright light. It's motion was not jerky however, it moved very quickly and fluidly to our left (north) and after 5 seconds we lost site of it due to large pines in our obstructing our view. I looked at my friend and he looked at me like did we really just see that. I then took the turn left, and drove on the road towards Finks Berry Farm, and on the way we still couldnt see the circle until we drove about a half mile on the road to where the trees end and a large open vield is present. I slowed down immediatley cause to our suprise the circle was suspended over the field and looked relativly closer and lower than previously. It remained in sight for at least 5 seconds, because once again we looked at eachother in amazement, and then back at the circle. Suddenly the brilliantly light object shut off its lights, much like a flash light, it was light the light sucked in quickly to a focal point, and I could still faintly make out the structure as it was a very stary night. We both talked later and agreed that after it's lights we're cut off we could still make the outline of a metallic object reflecting light from the heavens, we saw the body of the craft/or whatever it was, , for less than 5 seconds, and then it was gone. I didn't see it move or anything, it was! like th e lights went out, but we could still make out the outline of it, and then suddenly that just disappeared. It was the strangest thing in the world and I still am fixed on learning what the hell it was. I havent seen any strange objects in the night sky since, and I don't know if I want too. Me and my pal talked about here and there throughout the school year, and our conversation always consisted of man I'm glad you were with, and we know what we saw and we can collaborate that it was real. We also both agree that what we saw was not a shooting star, because it moved slower than that and it hovered. . . . . It was so odd, I just wish I had a camera on me, but it seems like things like this happen when we're off guard. Just some quick facts about the area where we saw the UFO. The carlton county area is a farm area, with many cows and other barn yard animals. It is an extremely rural area, with woods and some rolling hills, but mainly flat. Me and my friend also realized that the point in the sky where we first caught sight of this bright light was in a due line with the road. Interesting thing about this is that at the intersection where I stopped, the craft was roughly a quarter mile ahead of us, and before it moved it was positioned directly over a dirt road in an abandoned area. See the road is paved in all directions at the intersection except east, or in other words right in front of us. This is important I believe because there are cattle farms and an abundance of dear near the area. I'd like to say what we saw was an illusion, but damnit it just wasn't, I know what I saw and so does my pal, and for the rest of my life I will never forget that night.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  10/14/2002<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Silent delta-shaped object seen in Savage, MN against clear October night sky. Observed a delta-shaped object in clear skies. Object had 3 soft white lights at the vertices which shone downward. Approximately 40 feet in width. No other discernable lights or charactaristics. Moved in a south by southwesterly direction at approximately 150kts. Appeared to be about 1500 feet AGL. Made no sound, though it appeared close enough to be audible if it had jet enines. Left no contrails. Observed maintaining straight and level course for about 5 seconds, then rolled right to a 45 degree angle which caused the downward lights to shine brighter, as they were directed more towards the observer. After 1 second, object then rolled left back to a straight and level position. Object never appeared to change course or altitude during this rolling activity. Lost track of object due to distance and the horizon. Event took place near the intersection of Highway 13 and County Road 42 in Savage, MN while facing westward, and up at about a 30 degree angle. Background was a dark sky with a few visible stars, including Orion in the east. Highway 13 was illuminated, but obscured by a small hill in front of the observer. Slight glow seen over the crest of the hill from these lights, as well as the columns of light from Lake to the west. Object was just west of Highway 13, but certainly east of Lake, as it was observed passing in front of the beams of light from the casino. Observer is a pilot and is familliar with the air traffic around Minneapolis International Airport, about 20 miles to the northeast. This object did not conform to any recognizable aircraft lighting or flight patterns around MSP. No navigational lighting, beacon, or landing lights were observed. Object could not have been part of the air traffic pattern from MSP, as it was far too low. Also, the sudden rolling activity seemed very uncharacteristic for commercial aircraft. Lack of sound and contrails is very curious.<br>

None of us had ever witnessed 2 or more satelites moving together before, which made us all wonder if they were satelites. They seemed to be individual, and not a perfect formation. The first one in front disappeared after about 12 seconds then the next 2 disappeared a couple seconds later. [NUFORC Note: We suspect the witnesses observed the three satellites that move in formation, and which are reported to our Center frequently. They are thought to be three U. S.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large, black, foil / wing flying low over field near highway in dayimte. My fiancee and I were driving north on highway 94 north of Rogers, and south of St. Cloud, when I looked to the west (my left) and noticed something gliding over a nearby field. My fiancee was driving, and I was a passenger in the backseat with her elderly grandmother in the front. I told her to take a look, but since she was driving, she only caught a short glimpse of the object. Her grandmother was unfortunately unable to turn and look at it. My fiancee told me she had seen it, and asked if I could tell what it was, to which I replied, "not sure, but it doesn't look like any kind of plane I've ever seen. " As she continued to drive, the object was hovering slightly above the field at about 20 feet or so, then began to "sprint" in the same direction as our car was traveling (north) . It quickly caught up to our speed (about 75 mph.) , and then rose up to about 200 feet or so and stalled, then dropped to about 20 feet again, turned 180 degrees and took off in the opposite direction (south) . Once more it stopped, hovered for 2-3 seconds, then turned once more and took off at a fast pace. Finally, we were to far down the highway to see anymore. I am not an aviator or engineer of any kind, but from my distance (about 200-250 yards away) , it appeared to be approximately 20-25 feet from "wingtip" to "wingtip", and was about 4-5 feet wide in the middle. It was all black with no visible lights, and was in the shape of an air-foil or kinda folded wing; like an upside down, elongated U. It appeared to have no external propeller or engine, and no "cockpit" or apparent area for a passenger. I saw no people anywhere nearby in the field to make me think it was some sort of radio-controlled airplane; if it was, it was the largest radio controlled object I have ever seen! It was broad daylight at about 10:30 am with partly cloudy skies, and a slight wind from the west. I have included a map showing the approximate area we were, the direction we were traveling, the direstion (s) the object was traveling, and an illustration of what I saw. I hope this information is helpful, and I hope someone else saw what I saw.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Something odd scared the hell out of me and I swear to god it was realIt was late early AM I had just gotten off work and had been home for 1 hour or so. I made a snack watched a little t. v. and then proceded to bed. Upon lying in bed for awhile with my head opposite to the window, I began seeing lights reflecting/shining on the wall. They looked similar to an ambulance a fire truck or police. Some kind of emergency vehicle. I remember thinking what the heck is going on here. I did live in a very rural area at the time and I know I didn't hear any noise of sirens relating to an emergency vehicle. I remember lying there wondering what was going on. As far as I can remember I looked out the small window and saw nothing out of the ordinary. . . No emergency vehicle. So I climbed back in bed. Tried to blow it off as nothing. I tried going back to sleep wondering what the deal was. As I was lying in my bed I began to hear odd little noises. Quiet and suble. Kind of like voices, but they didn't make any sense. I heard some odd noise at the back door, but living in the country didn't think much about it. Then I felt a un-easy fealing like someone else was in the room. I looked up and I swear to god I saw a figure, not much higher than my water bed. At very most the figure was 3ft tall. It was staring directly at me. I looked at it, and remember thinking I am not seeing what I am seeing. I also remember a sense of panic. I suddenly could not move. I remember trying with all my might to move, but I couldn't. I couldn't move, couldn't speak or anything else. And I also remember be affraid for my life. I was never more affraid at that moment than I had ever been. Now I grew up out in the woods and in the country. I have seen wild animals, bear. . . deer. . . etc. Many people out of the area would be affraid of ther own shadow. . . in the great north woods so it takes alot to scare me. But I froze and can honestly say that I have never been more scared in my life. I have mentioned this story to a few others and they just think I am full of it. I did mention it to a roomate the next day that was sleeping in another room that night and he told me almost exactally the same thing that I had witnessed. A little more vague, but with substantial similarities without me going into detail with him. Additionally no alcohol, drugs or any other chemicals or stimulants were abused that night nor any time prior to that event. [name deleted][NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Lights above Eveleth Mn in mid 70'sI do not remember the exact date as asked. I was 15-16 yrs old at the time, which would make it fall of 1975 -1976. I believe it was a weekend since I was out late. I had left Sib's, a place kids hung out and bought candy at, had spent time plaing pinball, and rode my bike up Jones St. in Eveleth, MN which would be an easternly direction. A couple blocks away I had noticed a red light above the roof tops of the houses across the street which would be too the north. I cannot say how far the light was but it had to have been many miles. I realized it was moving slowly in a back and forth up and down fashion. For a while I rode back and forth on the street and finnally stopped to watch from the corner. If I remember correctly, the street corner was Jones and B Street. As I watched, a green Light emerged from the red and shot off to the east and soon after an orange light appeared and shot to the west. All I could do was sit there and watch it. About five or so minutes later, perhaps less, the lights came back. The green from the west and the orange from the east, not from where they shot to in the first place. The crafts then merged with the red light and the light shot quckly into the sky and disappeared. My experience with these things, ufo's and such, is emmence but for he most part I have kept it inside. My experiences began long before this and continue to this day even wih my moves to the Twin Cities and eventually to Pittsburgh<br>

She was washing dishes and thought I was seeing a low flying jet but I knew that jets just didn't hover and were not as huge. I watched the objet move over an island on the lake that we lived on. It paused over that land and then went off into space in a blink. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

She came inside to tell us about it, and myself and my 3 sons went outside to see if there were any more. Within 2 minutes my wife noticed an object traveling north, higher than a plane, consistent speed. Another couple minutes passed, we observed another, in almost the same path as the first. About 4 minutes later we observed another traveling south, opposite direction as the first two, but in what looked to be the same flight path. The sky became hazy and our observation ended.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw a cluster (7 min.) of tiny lights stationery in the sky like stars with shimmering lights for at least a half hour. I looked out my window as I was in bed and noticed a cluster of tiny lights in the sky. I thought at first that it was an airplane but the cluster didn't move. I watched diligently for about a half hour before falling asleep. The lights shimmered slightly and stayed in the irregular shaped formation. At 2:30 AM I awoke and checked the area in the sky. The cluster had disappeared. This was a very clear night I have seen reflections from satellites and man made objects in space but this did not appear like those. I couldn't estimate a distance but it looked like tiny stars. The shimmering lights reminded me of looking through an astronimic telescope and seeing the atmospheric shimmering effect. I am a retired Industrial Designer, of sound mind, and always interested in details. This is the only sighting I have witnessed of a supposed anomaly in space.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The date is approximate as it was long ago, but I'll never forget. I was about 12 years old riding a minibike on a gravel road when an object caught my eye moving in the sky. This is a rural area, so there are not too many aircraft to be seen. The object I saw was a tapered curved cylindrical object with a sphere on the narrow end. The object appeared to be metallic. I immediately stopped the minike and shut off the engine to observe the craft move to the west in a slow but steady manner and without making a sound. The distance and size of the object were hard to determine, but I'd guess it was at 3 to 5 thousand feet and approximately 50 feet long. I immediately rushed home approx a quarter mile and tried to locate the object with a telescope but it already disappeared. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Very bright light close to houseAn hour ago, my wife woke me up to take our oldest back to bed. She seemed quite awake and I assumed she was just getting into bed late for some reason. For some reason, something made a noise outside and my wife jumped. I asked her if she had checked all the doors before coming to bed and she had not, so I double-checked everything. When I was down in the basement (walk-out) I was checking the door to our backyard when I noticed the entire back yard was lit up. My mind ran through the various options and came up blank. The light source (which I could not directly see from my location) was somewhere on the other side of the trees but must have been very close from how bright everything was - practically daylight, with shadows being cast from ABOVE the trees. I watched for about 15 seconds, then decided to get a better angle from upstairs, which overlooks the yard and our neighbors yard as well. By the time I went up 1 story (maybe 10 seconds to go up the stairs) , the backyard was completely dark again. I ran upstairs and asked my wife if she had seen the bright light. She said yes. We were both a bit puzzled by it, and a bit freaked out. She asked me to bring our oldest BACK to our bed (when does that ever happen?) and I opened the door next to ours with the little one. Somewhat jokingly, I told her I was going to use her computer to do a Yahoo search on &quot;Chanhassen UFOs&quot; - she said &quot;DO IT!&quot;, so here I am…[NUFORC Note: We have attempted to correspond with this witness, but the e-address he provides is defective, despite the fact that he identifies himself as a software engineer.

Distance was about 1/2 mile heading north at a high rate of speed. I see commercial jets flying over every day and it was moving alot faster than I have ever seen anything else move except for military aircraft. The light was very large which made me think it was close. I could hear sounds of of crickets outside but this object emmitted no noise, NONE!!!! I told my wife to look and she commented on how fast it was moving. She thought it was probably a military jet. I said it's not making any noise?

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> craft sighted hovering over trees in rural minnesotaIt's taken me 8 years to get the courage to actually file a report, I feel rather stupid about it, but I need to talk about what I saw. In November of 1995 I left work about 8 AM I had to stop over at my parents house and decided to take a "back road" because it was quicker, the road is 7 miles of uninhabited state land, it is a winding dirt road, I had traveled it many times before and was very familiar with the road and terrain next to it. The night was overcast so there were no stars or moon visible, about 2-3 miles down the road I came around a sharp bend and saw an object hovering above the treetops straight ahead (where the road takes another sharp bend) . At first I was confused about what I was looking at, it didn't make sense what I was seeing. I stopped the car and put it in park, and rolled down my window, I heard absolutely nothing, the craft was about 50 ft down the road from me, It had 4 rows of orange or amber lights, and it had a whitish-green mist around the it, the bottom of the craft lit up the branches of the trees it was hovering over, the lights around the rim were NOT pulsating or changing colors, they remained constant and didn't seem to shine very brightly. About this time I completely freaked out! I didn't feel I had time to turn the car around so I threw the car into park and gunned it, I went straight towards the craft and hoped to hell it wouldn't start following me or shine a light on my car, (I had heard the stories) , Good God it was terrifying. When I got just about under it I had to brake to make the corner and I remember glancing up, I don't recall exactly what I saw, but I do remember a small bright "neon" green light somewhere on the bottom of the craft, I drove like a bat-out-of-hell until I got to my parents house, I could hardly walk into the house my legs where so weak, and as soon as I saw my mom I started bawling like a baby, She didn't really know what to say when I told her what happened. And to this day my family gets uncomfortable if! I bring it up. After that experience I had terrible nightmares, I'm not saying I was "abducted" but the nightmares were along that line. and I would have panic attacks when I drove at night, especially since I live in a rural area. Well I could write more, but I think this will do. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; date is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two star like objects accelerate and fade one after the other. I was standing outside in my backyard, which faces east, and was watching the sky as I usually do this time of evening. I noticed a very bright object about the size of the brightest star, which at first, was moving at an almost imperceptible speed. It was in the east, southeast part of the sky, at an angle of about 30 degrees. It accelerated north from its position, but always moving slower than a satelite, and faded out at about 5 degrees from its original position. I searched for the object for about 4 seconds when I noticed another object of the same magnitude a few degrees southwest of the first. It moved the same direction and speed as the first, and it also faded in the same manner and area as the first. Again, both objects seemed not to be moving at first, but accelerated about 5 degrees from their original positions and faded. Most satelites I watch travel well past 90 degrees at this time in the evening, and I've never seen 2 satelites travel this close to each other.

Approximately two seconds after the first flash, with their attention focused on the area of the sky where it had just occurred, they witnessed a second, similar flash. At almost the exact instant that they witnessed the second flash, they also observed a large fireball streak from east to west in the same area of the sky where they had just observed the two flashes. It was a very dramatic flash, and the fireball was moving VERY fast, according to the father's account of the incident.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Star like object in the night sky looked like it was trying to avoid a falling star?I was out on my balcony having a cigarette and looked up into the sky just to get a feel for the weather and whether or not it was going to rain. I looked over to the N/NW and saw a bright starlike object. I saw a falling star off to the right of the object and noticed that the object had made a swooping motion as if to avoid the falling star. It then continued to keep it's position in the sky where I had first witnessed it, yet constantly in motion. I began to think that I was perhaps imagining things so I went to get my wife who was already in bed asleep. She came out on the balcony and watched this phenomenon along with me. It continued to make swooping and other types of motion that I can say without a doubt was not the kind of motion you would expect at that altitude to be an aircraft of any kind. As we watched the object I and my wife witnessed multiple falling stars as well as motions from the object that simply cannot be explained as motion from either aircraft or satellite.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw a strange light show over suburban MinnesotaI was outside watching the stars, lying on the hood of my dad's car in the driveway. I was talking to my friend on the phone at the time. I saw a satillite traveling Northward across the sky. Later, I thought I was another satellite. This observation was reached by the luminousity of the object and it rate and direction of it's travel. The object appeared as one bright, white/yellow ball of light. Having lived under busy commercial air routes for my entire life, and being an amateur aircraft expert, I readily identified the object as not being commercial air traffic. The object was traveling in an Eastern direction, coming from the West. Suddenly the object stopped. It started to move again, but on a different course. The object was soon almost directly overhead. As the object was overhead, it rapidly flew in circles, zig-zag patterns, and hovered. I noticed there was a sort of hazy halo around the light, and that it left a slight hazt trail as it moved. After a few minutes of said displays, the object started moving rapidly North. Suddenly reversing directions, the object began traveling Southward. It was at this time that I noticed the object was not one white light, but three distinct lights composing one object, or very tight formation. The lights were colored green, red, and white. These are the colors used on commercial aircraft, but the did not appear in the correct configuration to be such an aircraft. As the object sped Southward toward the horizen, it stopped briefly. At this time, the object split into three different white lights in a triangle formation. As soon as the object had completed this transformation, it disappeared at incredible speed to the Southeast.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright blue light appeared across lake then shot off. It has been a few years since the event, but it still sticks out in my mind and I don't think I'll ever forget it. We were on a week long camping trip in the BWCA, when on the fourth night, we were at a beautiful campsite with great fishing from shore, and I had decided to try my luck at some night fishing. So, I left my companions at the fire and walked down a small trail and onto the rock outcroppings on the shoreline, about 150 feet from the campsite. The stars were out and were brilliant. There was no wind and the water was dead calm. I started casting for a while, and after about 15 minutes I snagged my lure on a rock in the water. I tried getting it loose, but it wasn't working so just as I reached out to cut my line, something caught my eye above the trees on the opposite shoreline (which was about 1/4 mile away) . I saw a bright bluish-white light rise up from the treeline very slowly for about 15 seconds. I just stood there looking at it in awe. If I had to guess at the size of it, I'd say it was as big as a bus, but I couldn't exactly tell the shape because of the blue glow around it. As it got further above the treeline, it stopped moving and just hovered for a few seconds. I yelled at my buddies, but they were too far away and busy talking around the fire. I kept my eyes on the light the whole time. It then started moving horizontally at about the same speed it had risen previously. It probably moved horizontally an eigth of a mile when all of the sudden, it shot off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I'd ever seen move before in my life. The object made no sound/noise at all. I just dropped my fishing rod and ran back to camp, shaking and hardly able to spit out a sentence. When I finally calmed down and told my friends the story, they just joked about it and would not believe a word of it. None of us were drinking or had any sort of drugs, unless there was something weird in the fish we ate out of that lake (just kidding) . I am not making this up. I would never lie about something like this. I wish I could find out if anyone else was camping in the BWCA at the same time and might have seen the same thing, from a different lake or somewhere nearby. A year and a half later, I saw almost the exact same thing in the winter, but not in the BWCA. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> At 11:55 pm on August 30th, ten people who were gathered around a campfire in northern Minnesota witnessed a triangular shaped craft that was subsequently chased by multiple military aircraft. The craft's 'wingspread' was an apparent two inches at arm's length. It had four white lights in a diamond shape at the front, an apparent one quarter inch in size at arm's length, and two solid red lights on each of the apparent leading edges. None of the lights blinked and all were very bright. We heard the craft coming over the trees at the water's edge before we saw it, so it was apparently flying very slowly. All were in awe upon seeing it, as it was flying much too slowly to be a 'standard' aircraft, the lights were very bright and distinct, and yet it was apparently high the sky. The sound it made was that of a very high flying commercial jet. It was flying west to east, directly toward Duluth, Mn. Prior to seeing this craft, two of the witnesses had been watching two apparent military aircraft in the distance north of the lake, flying east. After the craft passed overhead, these two military craft were seen flying very fast southeast to intercept the unindentified craft. No sound was heard from the military craft, which suggests they were at high altitude, and one of the witnesses, formerly in the military, stated that they were flying above mach speed. They covered ground VERY quickly. They then intercepted the unidentified craft several miles away and then flew next to it, while two more military aircraft appeared from the south and also flanked the craft, as it disappeared into the distance. All of the military craft were much smaller than the object, which dwarfed them. From this, it was estimated that the size of the object was approximately one thousand feet from wing tip to wing tip. Thirty minutes later, at 12:30am, several military craft were seen coming from the east, circled the area, and then joined with a group of aircraft following the exact path of the first object, and attempting to fly in the same triangular pattern, apparently in a attempt to show that the first object was only a military excercise. Again at 1:34am, two more military aircraft circled the area, this time close enough that through a binoculars they could be identified as fighter jets (the lights on these aircraft made structure visible) , and again they joined with a formation of other aircraft flying the exact path of the original object, and in a triagle formation. All witnesses thought this situation had an element of high strangeness about it. In one hour and thirty five minutes, twenty six aircraft were observed, including the original object. It is believed that twenty five of the aircraft were 'normal' military craft. The witnesses have been in this area during the summer for many, many years, and have never seen this number of aircraft, either during the day or at night, and hardly ever have seen military aircraft of any kind flying overhead. We are not on a normal commercial route and seldom see commercial craft overhead. It could be that the first two military craft flew in from Minot Air Force base in Minot North Dakota, although this is only speculation. We were able to video tape portions of the encounter, although we did not get the object on tape as it first went overhead, as we needed to send someone through the dark and into the cabin to retrieve the camera, thus the quality of the video is not very good. This was the first sighting of any kind for the vast majority of the witnesses. I'm the only person who has ever seen a UFO, having made a report to MUFON several years ago. Only one of the witnesses had been drinking alcohol, and that only beer.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Huge, stealth like craft passses over us with red and white lights, only to be followed by squadrons of fighters in its pathCraft sounded like a slow flying jet. We could hear it coming before we saw it. It was around midnight so it was dark and all you could see was the lights. There were four white lights on the rear of the craft in the shape of a diamond and two red lights on each wing, Maybe one on the end of the wing and one in the middle of the wings. None of the lights were blinking like all the other aircraft in the sky today. The lights on the wings were angled back so you could tell that the wings were swepted back like a jet. It reminded me of a Stealth only in a much much larger scale. At first I thought it was more than one plane flying in formation but the lights would'nt have made any sense, because there would have been only one plane with the four white lights on the back of it and four other planes flying with only one red light. So it came to our conclusion that it could only be one plane. Antway it continued across the lake and at that point we could see two other planes coming across the sky at a very fast rate of speed to meet up with it and fly almost like escorting it till it was out of our sight. About twenty minutes later a squadron of planes flew over us in the same exact spot and the same direction almost like they were trying to duplicate what the other had just done. Only the precision flying wasn't there, and the lights were blinking on these planes. They had red and white lights on them too. Only each plane had red and white lights on them. After a while another squadron of them flew the same way and a little while another squadron. All of these planes had both red and white lights blinking on them. Thats why I think that the first one we saw was one big craft.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Three faint blue triangles high in the sky. I'm amazed. I hope someone else saw some of this too. I arrived home at approx. 3:15 in the morning on sept. 4. as I was walking toward the house from the back alley/driveway I noticed what appeared to be a sattelite moving slowly from southeast to northwest. I didn't think much of it, other than it was quite bright, and seemed a bit low in the sky. It also was a tiny bit orange-ish in color which I thought was odd, but it was partly cloudy so I thought it may be just something to do with the atmosphere. Then I noticed the strange part. Moving at the same speed, and in the same direction, were three faint blue triangles of lights, all about a hands legnth (to the eye) apart from each other. They were each about the size of my thumb across, which seems quite large for how high they appeared to be. I immediately ran in the house and grabbed my video camera. I came back out to film the objects (which were moving very slow) but the darkness of the sky, and the lightness of the city made it impossible to see anything on my viewfinder, so I was unable to get any footage. The objects slowly moved out of veiw to the northeast. I also saw probably five to ten shooting stars, but I doubt if they were related in any way.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> golden brown triangle speeds across skywe were standing outside work after having a cigarette and talking about looking at mars through a telescope (keep in mind we werent) and then i saw this object moving through the air. it was in a triangle shape and moved across the sky at a very fast speed. there was no jittering motion just smooth like water, no noise no lights, just a reflecting or almost eluminated color of brown a golden brown the hight was from 1500 - 2200 ft above the ground. it went from the west to the east i saw it about in the middle of the sky and it only took a few seconds to race across the sky and disappear. the two other men who saw this with me are co-workers one fell just short of graduating law school and the other just short of an automotive class. all of us good honest people have no clue what it really wwas we saw. we went throught the thought of a bird or plane or weather balloon but then we slowly eliminated those by simple reason. birds honk especially geese plus it never changed shape bird dont even hold together that tight and usually change shape as they fly. plane- no lights at night planes have to fly with lights and its size and shape outruled that idea let alone no noise and how fast it was, and the wind was coming from the east ruling out a weather ballon, i dont think it would fly against the wind at that speed.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I sent this in the other day tothe national reporting site as well. . . . My brothers and I and other friends have saw ufo's in the area over the years. What started it for me was in 1967 or 68 in june I saw a large disc tree top high at about 15 mph . It was about 250ft around. and I could see the writing of some kind on the craft . I was in my dads yard and the ufo flew just over the trees across the road -my dad was under his car and dident come uot to see it when I yelled look. So I went to see if anyone nextstore saw it. Thay had there backs to it hanging cloyhs on the line. . . "However they saw me" about 9/2/03 I saw on the history channel that the cattel mutalations started in about 1967. And they say that it is lasers that make those clean cuts. And back then there was no laser or portable ones. 1967 in late june I was 8 year old-- this was after I saw the ufo--I was playing alone in the woods just behind the house for a while. Then I came to the front of the yard to see we had company--My dads sister and boys my age --they went to the treehouse--so I to went to find them --I went up the tree into the the treehouse --5 minits or so later I noticed my right leg felt funny --So I went back down to the house to my bedroom and pulled down my long leg bluejeans --with no cut in them--or no blood on them --I looked at my leg and I had a 6 inch long cut a inch and a half deep--still not bleeding--and no pain --I went to show my mom to take me to the doctor and have it sticked up--She said what happend --and I said I don't no-- But it is a laser cut made by that ufo I saw. 1968 in june agin--I was with one of my 3 brothers picking blackbarrys with the family dog. This time we where accross the road from my dads house direcly under the path of the ufo I saw the year befor. I said to my brother --I found more barrys over here so we went deeper into the woods and never seemed to find the barrrys --We thought we got lost--We got picked up by a ufo and they took us to a place and dropped us off--We think-- WE saw pine trees with snow on the branches ? --The next thing we no we found areselfs inside of a hourse fence a mile from home. --there is no way we could have walked there without crossing a tar road and 2 dirt roads. We did not cross any roads lost in the woods to get there. Thats where they dropped us off. We new right what had just happend. Also we don't remember when we lost the family dog. but the dog was at home. 1976 trapping season my same brother went to cheak our trap line in back of the house--with a friend they dident go far--on a hay feild at dusc they heard a crashing noise like branches braking--They stopped and saw a dark image of a small ufo come right out of the forest and stop at the feild --then it started to glow and they ran and got me and we all went back to the spot --we took a gun with --We dident see anything at frst so we went farther back to a tree line dividing 2 feilds--At the end of the next feild we could see a red object that flew in the night sky slowly over the trees --the light would go out--and when it came back on it was forward and down from where it was--and when the light went out agin and came back on it was back and up from where it just was--and we could see the tree tops lighting up under it --like it was taking picturs 1999 I was at my dads cabin in atkin MN with my family of 3 and we slept in a camper in the yard that stay. after we left my dad called me to say there was 3 dark rings in the grass in the most open part of the yard. He said they where not there untill we stayed over the weekend[NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Black, unlit, triangular, silent, stationary, object hovering at high altitude, July 2003 in Willmar Minnesota USA. While attending the Sonshine festival Willmar Minnesota as sundown was approaching my teenaged daughter noticed a black object flyinging in a stationary (hovering) position directly over the concert. I noticed it too and since we were at a concert I had a monocular. I used it to look closer and saw a totally black triangular object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet or more above ground. My daughter, her sister and my wife each eventually looked at the object through the monocular. My wife who is a pilot insists that it was not like any flying object she has ever seen. Each of us took turns the next day drawing a picture of what we saw. Without any help from each other we all drew the same item. There were no lights (on the object) and no reflection from the sun. The object eventually became impossible to see as the sun went down. It made no noise.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw a very bright red cirucular shaped object travel jerk through the skyWhile going outside to take a look at mars on August 28th, 2003 I watched the sky for about 10 minutes when I saw a circular red ball travel across the sky. It was not very high above the ground and I was able to watch it for about 1 and a 1/2 minutes. The night was so clear and still you could hear a mouse in the woods at 100 yards away. The milky way was as bright as it gets. This object made NO sound and kinda jerked as it moved in a straight path heading North East. The object was brighter than anything in the sky by far &amp; had a red glow with a very different look that I had never seen before. Its been 5 days now and I felt I should file a repost to see if anyone else had seen the same thing. I am 41 years old and have had my own contracting business for over 18 years. I have been married for 15 years with 2 children.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large V shaped aircfaft slowly flying overhead while other planes scramble to catch up. The craft in question came out from behind the tree line above and out in front of us heading NNE. If I was to hold my fingers out at arms length and about 2 1/2 inches apart, that would be about the size it appeared in the sky. The sound was a low rumble like you would hear from a jet liner going over, except that the sound was coming directly from the source, as opposed to trailing the aircraft, which makes me think that it wasn't very high in the sky, but yet I would estimate it at between one and two miles. It turned to the east and continued on until it was out of sight. As far as the shape, I would say it was like a B2 bomber but would have had to have been bigger. A little before we saw this my brother and nephew had noticed a couple smaller aircraft flying around to the north of the lake. As the big one turned to head east, the two screamed across the sky and met up with it a ways out. We could not hear the smaller planes so they must have been pretty high up. On a normal night we may only see one to four planes on average, and knowing how slow they move across the sky I thought that the two planes must be jet fighters because they crossed the sky quickly. Within an hour later 2 smaller planes came back from the east and we watched them thinking that it may be the same two that had caught up and escorted the big one. They had made a couple of turns, which again made me think that they were not commercial planes (again, what we normally see up there are commercial planes that fly high over head in a perfectly straight line.) Anyway then we heard planes overhead and saw four planes flying in "V" formation and trying to follow the same route as the big craft flew. The formation looked like they were trying to make it look like it was what we saw earlier, but was obviously not. After a while and seeing a few more planes jetting around the sky I went to bed, but was told that everyone that stayed up saw one more display of the "V" formation a little later. A few key points to myself are. 1) We normally will only see one to three planes per night. We sit out at the campfire every weekend looking up at the stars and counting satellites, so it's not like we don't look up. On this night we saw in excess of 20 planes, all after 11:45 AM 2) The big craft appeared to be flying too slowly for something that big. 3) The fighters that screamed across the sky to intercept or escort. A couple of questions. 1) What was this large craft? 2) Would the airforce admit to flying "training exercises" or anything else? 3) Is it possible that this large craft was below radar and the other planes were waiting for it to show itself, and we saw it as it was going up and the two smaller craft streaked toward it when they picked it up again. Lastly I would like to mention one thing that may have nothing to do with this but may be worth mentioning. About an hour earlier than the sighting of the big craft, we heard loud commotion back in the woods maybe a mile or more that sounded like many coyote's or wolves howling or fighting. This went on and off for about a half an hour or so and ended shortly before seeing the big craft. These sounds were coming directly in the area of where we saw the craft come from. Probably just a coincidence[NUFORC Note: The date of the sighting was August 30. We have amended the data above. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 3 seperate sighting of a series of 6 red lights taking on a wing formation, slow moving, engine sound (but not jet engine) This occurred at our propery outside of Brainerd, MN. At 11:30pm, 12:25am and 1:30am. There were six red lights in a wing pattern, but no tail lights, it was moving fairly slowly and looked quite large, I heard a definite engine sound, but did not sound like a typical jet aircraft. There is no airfield large enough to land such a large craft (I did not make out an actual shape or craft, just the lights, but they spanned a large area) . The same (or different) lights, traveled over the same path on the 3 seperate times indicated above - I tried to take pictures the second time, I have not yet developed the film. The exact location was at the Mississippi River, at Riverton, MN (at the location of Rabbit lake) . I did not call the hotline since it may have been planes (but it must have been a huge plane and I don't know where such a plane would land) and I don't know how to check with the local airports to see if it was in fact a plane (somebody would have been tracking it, I assume) . We have been going to this piece of property for 3 years and I have never seen similar air traffic- which is why I thought I would report it.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  1.5 hours<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Very large, slow moving, wing shaped craft was chased by 3 F15&#39;s. 4 white lights, 4 red lights. As I was fixing my rootbeer float, my dad came storming in to the cabin yelling of a UFO. I immediately ran out to see what everybody was looking at. I looked up and saw this large slow moving craft that made a low rumbling sound, like a passenger jet at 30, 000 feet. The craft had a flying wing appearance with 4 red lights on the trailing edges, 2 on each side spaced evenly across its wingspan. 4 white lights in a diamond pattern were focused near the center and were equally as bright. It was flying slow enough and/or low enough that the sound was not delayed but seemed to emanate directly from the craft. Holding my hand out above me, the craft was about 2 inches wide in the sky and was moving at a rate of 1 inch per every 2 seconds, and seemed to be accelerating. After about 30 seconds of watching it move in a straight line across the sky, 2 aircraft which appeared to be F15&#39;s were moving in on its location at very high velocity. Once both reached the craft one F15 followed off the crafts left wing, and another directly behind it. Both of these F15&#39;s had noticeable wing tip lights and a center flashing light, standard to military aircraft. In the distant we could still hear the low rumble of the craft yet no sound from screaming the F15&#39;s, which suggests they were too far away too hear, which would also imply the scale of this craft was enormous. After another minute or so, we could still see the flashing lights of the following F15&#39;s in the distant, while another F15 flew overhead at very high velocity toward the craft in the distant. From then on we saw an occasional pair of F15&#39;s which looked to be in a search pattern across the sky. Not more than a half hour later 4 military aircraft flew over head in a formation that looked similar to the craft that flew over, yet only a single white light in the center, one red light to the right, and 2 red lights way too far off to the left. All had flashing lights. They looked as though they were trying to “copy” the lights of the first craft. A! lthough, it was obvious these were F15&#39;s or similar because they were traveling at much higher velocity and the delay of sound was very long. Within a time span of an hour, 2 more F15&#39;s had circled around and met up with yet another formation of five F-15&#39;s that closer matched the look of the first craft, yet even this time it was obvious again that these were more F15&#39;s in a V-formation at high altitude, high velocity, and long delay of sound.

It was boomerang-shaped, golden, and circling the duplex my family lived in and the home next door. After watching for a while, I got out of bed to tell my dad (who was watching the late news) about the "ghost bird" flying above the house. He told me to go back to bed. When I did, it had left. However, I woke up later on in the night, and it had returned. I called it the "ghost bird" for a long time, until I found out about UFOs. I hope this helps. Thanks.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A large V shaped object in the night sky. I SEEN A v shaped object in the south eastern sky. It was 11:15 pm. It was very large. About the size of a football field or larger. It was moving very slowly. It made no sound. It had three red lights on one side and two on the other. It had a cluster of white lights in the nose. With my binoculars I could tell that the cluster was three white lights. These three white lights toghter were about the same size as one red light. These lights were not flashing like plane lights do. The one red light that was missing was bettween the two red lights on one side. It glided off to the east, till I couldn't see it any more. I seen it for about 3 minutes. All the lights moved together as if it was one huge object.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  8-10 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Opaque white beams of light that repeatedly hit a lamp, turning it on and off. . . I dont recall the exact date of this, all i know is it was in the winter of 99-00, probably between January and February 00. Its taken me awhile to come forward cuz it was a very scary experience, and many people would question my sanity. It was shortly after 11:00 pm, and i was reading up in my living room by myself. We lived on shore property of a lake at the time, and our living room was an upper story room directly overlooking our lake. My recliner was right next to our huge picture windows, and it was a great view. . . anyways, i simply saw a beam of light shoot into my house. It didnt just "appear", it seemed to grow from a point i could not tell over the lake, and expand into the room. It was about the diameter of a softball, and very opaque white in color. The most incredible thing though, is that when it reached its furthest point, it actually hit the lamp kiddy-corner from me in the room! Immediately the light turned OFF and the "lazer beam" just withdrew. I was so completely stunned that i just sat and stared-i mean this beam had passed no more than 2 feet directly in front of me and turned off one of my lights! So i tried not to freak out, and decided to stay where i was and watch. No more than a minute later the same beam shot back in, hit the lamp, and turned it on! At this point, i was beyond scared. So i got up and ran into my bathroom, crouching low to my floor so i wouldnt get hit. The bathroom was directly to the right of the lamp that was being hit, so i partially closed the door to "protect" myself and still watch. For the next 5-6 minutes the beam continued to shoot in, turn on or off the light, then recede. After those 5 or so minutes, it didnt happen again, the light just remained off. So from there i booked it downstairs to my mother's room. She was trying to sleep of course so when i frantically woke her and raved about "lazer beams", naturally she was a lil' peeved! But my mom sat up with me to look out her window (same lake view as upstairs)! for a couple minutes. We actually saw different beams of white light shooting horizontally in various directions. By the time 10-ish minutes were done, the lights were done. I (carefully) went upstairs to make sense of it all attempt sleep. I must add to this that When i went back up there, i heard a very low-decibal sounding hum, that kind of vibrated inside my ears, and it seemed to be all around and above our house. I figured i was only hearing the refridgerator, but i know how that sounds-quieter and higher piched than this new sound-plus i heard it shut off short after. The low humming continued a few more minutes, but i was so spooked i went to bed! I should also add that there were other instances when we lived on the lake that we had seen diagonal light beams, discs, and strange sattelite-type lights. I was 15 at the time, just a home-school student getting ready to go to college early, and always an honest, intelligent person. I was most definately not on any hallucinogenic drugs either! My mother can vouche for what i saw, and i'm happy to share it w/ u. But i do have a ?: has anyone else seen these? I really havent heard anything quite like what i saw, inspite of the fact that i listen to Art Bell and Whitley Strieber religiously! O- almost forgot to add that the next morning when i examined the window the glass was fine, the screen looked sorta burnt, and there was a perfect circle melted out of the weather plastic! WHY?<br>

My husband saw the light move up and down but by the time I got outside, it was somewhat stationary in the western sky. The movement was not like an airplane. No noise. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. It seemed to be pulsating with energy. We watched it fade into distance.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Disk<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> My background is with the Department of Defense Special Technical Operations. I do not wish to mention which company or location for obvious reasons but all information can be verified by numerous witnesses that my statements are true and accurate. At approximately 10:30pm in the summer of 1973 myself and two other friends had just parked my car in a large field to have a few beers and talk and just basically enjoy the pleasant summer evening. There was a full moon that night and it seemed to be bigger and brighter than I had ever seen. The moon was so bright that even though we were parked in the middle of a large field where there were no lights anywhere for perhaps a mile or more, we could see well enough to read by. While passing out our first beers to my buddies I happened to notice an object in the night sky which I estimated to be at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 ft. I thought that I had seen the object move in a triangular pattern at such a speed that I was not sure if I had actually been correct in my initial observation. Without mentioning what I thought I had seen to the other two people who were present with me, I continued to keep my eyes on the object. After about fifteen or twenty seconds it did it again. After seeing this happen a second time, I pointed the object out to the others and asked them to keep their eyes on it. They both laughed and started joking about how it was probably a flying saucer. Because none of us had ever before seen anything of the sort and didn't actually believe the stories of such reports, I suggested that it might be a new military heliocopter or something of the sort because it did not appear to have a comparable lighting arrangement to anything that I had seen before. As the three of us kept our collective eyes on the object the craft made similar movements to the first that I had witnessed by myself. After seeing the speed at which this craft moved and the sharp angles at which it changed direction in mid flight, the two others who were with me became very excited and immediately decided that it was indeed a UFO. After the three of us had witnessed seeing the same such movements of the object, I decided to move my car so that my headlights would be pointing directly at it. I did not turn the headlights on until I was sure that they were pointing directly at the object after which, I began to flash them on and off and from high to low beam in a fashion similar to the old light signaling technics used by the navy. After flashing my lights in this fashion for about fifteen seconds or so, I turned them off and waited to see what would happen. At first I did not think that anything would come of it but, after about twenty or so seconds, we all noticed that the object had stopped flashing in the mannor that it had been and that instead it now appeared as a white light which remained on and didnot flash at all. As we continued to watch this object we noticed that it now appeared to be getting bigger and within a few more seconds it became obvious that it was heading in our direction at a fair rate of speed. The object had dropped in altitude and was now comming in just over tree top level. As the object moved closer to us it turned off it's lights or light and as it came within the last quarter mile or so it passed directly in front of the full moon which showed a very precise silouette of what was indeed a saucer shaped craft. The moonlight was being refracted off of the craft and it was now very clear that the craft was polished silver in color. As we continued to observe this craft during the last one hundred yards or so of it's approach, one of my friends became so terrified by the sight that he wet his pants and began to panic. This person is a large man and usually afraid of nothing. The friend of mine who became terrified was attempting to hide himself behind the back seat of my car and screaming that we were all going to die and that they were going to take us and disect us. As I stood there and watched this craft, it came directly over our heads at approximately 100 to 120 feet at which time it stopped moving and just hovered in mid air. There was no sound emitted from the craft at all and there was no wind being generated such as would be from a turbine or rotor blades. The craft was so close and the light from the moon was so bright that I could make out certain details of the saucer which struck me as interesting such as, rivots along where the apparent metal panels or sections of the craft were fitted together. I could also see that the lights which were around the entire outer edge of the craft rectangular shaped and were raised somewhat from the rest of the saucers surface area perhaps as much as two inches. The lights or light covers appeared to be somewhat opaque or semi-transparent and appeared to be fairly thick. The closest thing that I have seen to describe this craft would be the saucer that was shown on the beginning of the old TV serial called THE INVADERS which was aired back around 1969 or 1970. The saucer continued to hover directly over head for approximately 30 seconds and then shot off towards the west so fast that all I could see was a red trail leading to where it now hovered somewhere near HWY 5 which is also in burnsville, MN. As we continued to watch the saucer dropped down below the tree line for about another 30 seconds and then lifted up to it's original altitude of about 100 to 120 feet. It then hovered for about 15 seconds in a stationary position after which it shined what appeared to be a red lazer beam aimed at an approximate 45 degree angle into space for about 2 to 3 seconds before taking off at the same extreme rate of speed previously witnessed. As it exited our atmosphere, it followed the same precise angle and direction as the red lazer that it had projected into space. About five minutes after the exit of this craft from our atmosphere, the other two friends who were with me said they saw what they described as a giant meteor or comet shooting directly in front of the moon. I did not see this other object but did make a note of the time. When I looked at my watch it was now 11:55pm. I cannot explain the missing time. Since this experience I have discovered many new technologies and have had many experiences which have opened my eyes to what actually happened that night. I cannot get into the details at this point and it would take volumes to tell it all. Also, the truth is now out there and it will soon be widely known to the rest of the world no matter what happens to me. I have given the description of this particular event simply because it is past time to bring this subject into the light of truth. Also, there is now to much that is becomming common knowledge for my past to continue to be a threat to the extent that it has for the last thirty years. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

On my way home from work early Sunday morning I noticed some bright lights just above the trees. I thought it was for a ball field but I'd never seen them there before. As I got closer I realized they were too high up to be attached to the ground but they appeared to be stationary. I was only a few blocks from home and it was hard to tell if it was moving until I stopped for a stop sign. It was hovering slowly and very low. When I reached my driveway and turned my engine off I could hear a low hum. It was right above my backyard, big black triangle shaped with three lights I watched for a few more minutes as it slowly traveled north.<br>

I only got one really good picture. I have a bunch of other shots but they are not as good. I saw bright flash in western sky. HUGE bright light. Then it ZIPS to a southeast position. Sits there. I yelled for (hubby) and then for the boys who were having band practice. The object had by then moved to a southwest position and just sat there. Multiple lights flashing and appeared to be changing in shape. I will have each of them write up a separate statement. The object then SINKS on the horizon VERY SLOWLY. As if to land? This lasted a good total of 20 minutes as of us able to view it. AND it was HUGE. Biggest I have ever seen for the distance. Hubby had to leave and the boys were a little shell shot. They just couldn't believe what they saw. I continued to watch and a JET came in or at least it sounded like one and I grabbed my camera and keys and went to my car to pursue it. By the time I got down to the lake I no longer could see it or the jet. But it was HUGE!!!! I will send their statements later. They went off to a friends' house.

<b>SIGHTING:</b>  11/2/2003<br><br>
<b>REPORTED:</b>  11/12/2003<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5-7 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw a triangular shaped craft that emmitted a beam directly at us and then followed over the top of our vehicle for a short distance. On Sunday, November 2, 2003 my husband, my fifteen year old daughter and myself were coming home from a housewarming party we had attended for a co-worker of mine who lives in St. Paul. We left her house that evening around 5:15-5:30 PM and drove our vehicle heading north on HWY 61 from the eastside of St. Paul to our destination in Forest Lake. We had so much fun at the party that I turned off the radio in my SUV so we could talk all the way home about the good time we had. There was a slight chill in the air that night, so I had the heater on blowing out heat, but the skies over us were dark but very clear. As we approached Forest Lake on HWY 61 I was driving and my husband was in the passengers seat had reached over to turn off the fan for the heater. We just started to reach town and had driven almost 26 miles now and our vehicle was quite warm on the inside. The only sound was our discussion and the sound of the tires on the road. At this time my daughter had taken out her prizes she had won from playing games at the housewarming party. She won some nice jewlery and wanted my husband and I to look at it. I turned and took a quick coutesy glance because I was driving and my husband began to examine her prizes. We could see because we had now started to come into the out skirts of Forest Lake and there were street lights that some what lit up the inside of the vehicle. I turned my gaze back to the road and off into the distance and coming from the east towards the west I saw some blinking lights. At first I thought nothing of it, it must be a plane because we have a small air field on the south edge of town. But on further examination the lights seemed to be different somehow. They were different colors and seemed to be blinking faster than a plane would, almost in a sequence or pattern. This had captured my attention and I could not take my eyes off of it. I said to my husband and daughter, "look you guys, over there up in the sky, what is it?" My husband said, "where! ?" I said, "over to the right. " "It is coming from over by the chain of lakes this way. " I slowed my speed way down as I drove because we were approaching the south end of town. I had noticed the lights blinking in the sky as I just passed the first set of stoplights on HWY 61 coming into Forest Lake. I said to my husband, "what is it?" He said, "ah, it's only a plane. " But we all continued to watch it. As we headed up to the second set of stop lights I had notice the blinking lights became closer but still far enough away up in the sky for the shape to be unreckonizable. The lights no longer were moving from east to west, but were now hovering to the right of HWY 61 above the homes behind the businesses that line HWY 61. When we reached the stop light it was red and all three of us saw the lights stop blinking but they were still lit and the object quit hovering. It proceeded from east to west so that it was above HWY 61 and then all of a sudden went in reverse and backed up very quickly, almost like it was lining itself up for something. At this point my husband looked down to push the button to make the power window go down because I had said to him, look it just went backwards! He said, "I saw that!" That is why he wanted the window down so he could hear the sound that propellers make if a helicopter is overhead. I said to my husband, "that is no plane!" I asked him again, "what is it?" He said, it is a helicopter, but I do not hear any sound. He was busy pushing the button to make his window go all the way down, my daughter was putting her prizes away and I was looking straight ahead as we sat at the red light at the intersection of 11th and HWY 61. I was in the lefthand turn lane to go west on 11th towards our home. As I pondered what this might be for that split second. All of a sudden this so called helicopter flashed a large beam of light down directly at us. It flashed me right in the face. I said to my husband and daughter in the back seat that object just flashed us. "WH! Y?" My husband who had his windown down by now said, "that is a search light, they must be looking for someone or something. " I told him, no. This was different. It was a light like a camera flash but as bright as fireworks, but only aimed directly at us in a beam. My husband at this time stuck his head out of the window to hear for the sound of a helicopter. He said, "what the heck?" "I do not hear anything!" So my daughter had pushed the button to make her window go down and stuck her head out the window too and she could not hear anything either. But the object was too far up in the sky for us to make out the shape and form. We only seen lights and at this point they were no longer blinking. My husband noticed in the car next to us was a family looking at the same object in the sky. They were not in the turn lane like us, but heading north on 61 into town He said the father was on the drivers side and mother on the passesngers side in the frontseat. They were looking straight ahead as if frightened, but there were two teenage girls in the back and they were looking out their side windows up at the object and he thought one was rolling her window down and was sticking her head out to get a better look at this thing that just flashed us. At this point I said to my husband and daughter maybe it is one of those experimental government planes and they are taking it out for a spin and trying it out, but it bothered me that they flashed this light down right in our faces. Well, at this point the stoplight finally turned green, it is a long light. We could finally go and we thought we had seen the last of this object for good. Both my husband and my daughter still had their windows down trying to hear for some sound, any type of sound. There was none. As I made the turn they started to make a rukus about something. So I turned to look in the direction they were looking and what I saw out my husbands window was this object come from the sky where we could only see it as lights and it wisked! its way down to tree level. "Oh, my God!" What is it? My husband stuck half of his body out of the rolled down window and my daughter stuck her head out the window and I peered through the front window upward driving very very slowly. What was now directly above us we could not believe our eyes! We were all seeing it very clearly. Looking upwards we could see the underneath of this object. What we seen was a large triangular craft. The top point of the triangle was in the front and pointing the same direction as the headlights on our SUV as I headed west on 11th Avneue. This tip had a light in the point, maybe a couple feet wide. The two other points forming the back (base of triangle) of the craft had also had the same lights in the tips. When it first hovered above us these lights were a light yellowish glow. Glow meaning the lights did not illuminate on us or the road beneath the craft. This triangular craft was an equal lateral triangle, all sides the same length. The craft hovered directly above us and followed us down the road a short distance. It was just above the tree tops as it followed us. The craft was as wide as the road from shoulder to shoulder and was approximately a school bus and and half large. My husband is better with measurements than I am, but I am the one filling out this report so bear with me. As the craft slowly moved along above us, I was going about 25-30 mph it changed the color of the lights underneath located in the tips of the triangle. The front one was now red and the other two, green and blue. The outside edges were glowing with a yelowishgreen light all the way around the outside perimeter of the craft and also the same thing aprox. 2-3 feet inward. The middle of the triangle was dark against the night sky, but could not see the stars through it so we knew it was solid. My husband has good eyesight and does not wear glasses he saw the underneath with half of his body stuck out of the window. My daughter her whole head was out of the window look! ing up. There was absolutely no sound! I said to my husband and daughter this is awesome, kind of like being in a movie because this is something you do not see everyday. My daughter got scared. She said, "you guys, I think this is a UFO we are seeing and it is really scarey!" I tried to assure her, but did not know what to say. I told her maybe it is just a government experiment we are seeing, knowing it could be something more. My husband said, "well all I know for sure is no one can tell me this is a weather balloon. " As the craft followed us a short distance it went a little faster ahead so it was right infront of us still at tree level. At this moment I noticed that I had this trucker without a load and just his rigg behind me right on my back bumper and he was practically running me off of the road. But I held my ground. Then the craft shot straight up directly over us and higher than the trees so it could navigate over them. Once it was up in the air it shot very quickly south over the trees and then down again. At this point we could only see the red light and it seemed to skim across Clear Lake and disappear. We could no longer see it through the trees. The trucker behind us was going hysterical all over the road. We finally turned off of 11th and the trucker drove fast and furiously down the road toward the other side of Clear Lake. We think he was either following it or trying to get away from it. When we got home we were so amazed by what we saw none of us spoke about it until the next day. When I went to work I told a co-worker who was at the housewarming party. She knew me and I felt she would not make fun of me for sharing this expeience with her. Later that evening my husband and I talked about it, asking each other what was the flash and could there possibly be any explanation for what we seen. The next morning at work I spoke with the same gal and told her we could not forget what we seen because it made such an immpression on us. That morning I got on the internet! and looked up planes to see if there were any shaped like a triangle, not really expecting to find any, but had to look none the same. Then I thought about what my daughter had said and I typed in the acronymn UFO for "unidentified flying object". My search engine brought up this site and on the home page as I scrolled down was a rough drawing of what I had seen. I grabbed my co-worked after she hung up the phone and brought her over to my computer to show her the drawing on the web page. She could not believe her eyes that it was there exactly how I decribed it. I confided in a few others as they too overheard our discussion. They know me and can vouche for my character. This is not something I would make up. I spoke with my husband at lunch that day and we were concerned about the flash we received. We wanted to find a way to get in touch with those present that night. I called one of the local newspapers and asked the gal who answered the phone if anyone called in to report something strange or unusual in the sky over Forest Lake Sunday night. She laughed and said "no". I then called the competition newspaper and was able to speak with a reporter who to print the story and wanted our names and possibly picures. He said, sounds like you seen a UFO and having our names will make it seem legitamate. This way if someone saw it they could call the newspaper and get in touch with us. I told him, not with out my husbands permission, I would call him back the next day. When I did he never answered the phone so I left a message. After talking with my husband he did not want our identity given out since we live in such a small community and we are active members in one of the larger churches in town. He did not want us to suffer harassment or to be humiliated by those not believing our story. We both however are concerned about this beam of light flashing us and are concerned about what it could do to our health. We were wondering if others who may have had similar experiences could somehow! get through to us through this website and contact us to let us know if there are any side effects or long term conditions that arise as a result to being exposed to this beam of light. At his point I want to say to the readers of my report that all three of us, my husband, my daughter and myself are church attending Christians. We live in a small, but growing community. We are respected members of our community and church and live busy lives. My husband and myself both are employed and hold responsible full-time positions and my daughter has been in classes for gifted children and currently in advanced classes. My husband and I are both educated and above average intelligence. We have no need to make a fraudulent claim and waste our time and yours reading this report. In our busy lives up until now there has not been a lot of time to spend contemplating the existence of what we have seen. This sighting has changed the way we view things and we will never be able to look at the night sky the same way. If there is a logical explanation for what we saw we want to find it. If there is not we will realize that this is probably a once in a lifetime experience. Thank-You for reading our story and if you have any experience with being flashed with a beam of light from a triangular craft we would like to know about it. Please contact the wonderful people who dedicate their time and energy to maitaining this site. Hopefully they will put you in touch with us. "The three of us"<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> moving light in sky, changed direction and disappearedSaw a bright white light in the sky approx. as big as a cigarrete butt in diameter. Moved to the northeast, approx. 5 miles, then turned and went straight into the air until it disappeared from sight into the sky. Light moved at an incredible pace, no noise, no contrail, no strobe or wing lights. I do not know how far away it was, or how far it travelled. I estimate it was 15 miles away, and travelled a total of 12 - 15? miles. The light was accelerating from the time I saw it, until it disappeared.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Blue and Red ball of light, that just floated in the sky , TELEPATHY THEORY MY OWN ENCOUNTERI saw two lights. Off to the right was a red round shape light, off to the left was a blue round shaped light about 1/2 apart. They both were about as high in the sky as your usuall water towers. The amazing event that occurd was that I wanted to see them in this area because it was a UFO hot-spot about 25-30 years ago. In that time frame, my mom and other relatives saw craft and lights on differnt ocasions. Also there is a cattle farm right next to where I saw the crafts. The most idea I want to explain is that I mostly looked at the blue one, because It moved/floated to which ever direction I mentally told it to. It was actually kinda of friendly. They stayed there untill I left the area. My family knows I am not making this [deleted] up, because they all saw unexplained events at differnt times in the same area years ago.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Silver cigar shaped object travelling low, and at great speed on US 52 in SE Minnesota. While driving in heavy traffic two days before Christmas and returning to Rochester, Mn. from Minneapolis, Mn. on US 52, I, [name deleted], and [name deleted--Witness #2] witnessed a craft travelling at unbelievable speed from W to E. , across the highway as 52 runs N. and S. It was quite low, and kept a steady speed. It was out of sight very quickly. There was no sound. It was silver and cigar shaped from a side view. I called 911 on my cell phone and it was eventually answered by the Minnesota State Troopers. The operator told me that he was inundated with calls about this craft. It was such an unsusual experience that [Witness #2] and I looked at each other with our mouths open. I have also worked with jet aircraft in the military for many years, and this was NOT a jet aircraft. It left something. . . . a pulse-like wave not in it's wake, but in front of it. Apparently, many saw this event while driving, not just on 52, but on perpendicular and parallel roads as well. The speed and shape were something I'd not witnessed before. Coupled with it's lack of ANY noise, it was clearly something new, or something I'd never seen before. There are NO major airbases in the area. Not even an airport within 60 miles.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 30 Minute Encounter with Hovering Saucer 300 Yards AwayIn 1969, I was 5 years old and my family lived on a farm in rural Minnesota approximately 2 miles Northwest from New York Mills (population 750) . My Family (Father, Mother, Older Brother 12, Myself 5, and my younger brother 2) was driving home on a rural dirt road to our farm house near dusk (i. e. somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 at night in July) . We were heading west down the dirt road that passes by our house when we saw a strange light emanating from behind our nearest neighbors house. The light was brilliant. As we drove nearer we asked each other "when did our neighbor install a spot light in their yard?" We approached our neighbors house for about a mile and kept looking at the light, but did not understand why they had installed such a bright light in their yard. The road turns North directly in front of their house. As we headed North, my brother, mother, and I kept our eyes focused on the light and we determined the light was not coming from their yard, but instead was coming from a craft/UFO hovering behind their house. After traveling North for 200 yards North, we turned west again and all of us including my father could now see the saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 feet off the ground 100 yards behind the neighbors house. The craft was a brilliant orange, metallic color and was 30-40 tall and 100-150 feet wide and it was the classical saucer shaped craft. We then turned into our driveway (North) and parked the car about 100 yards from the main road which left the craft hovering about 300 yards south from where we were parked. We all got out of the car and focused our attention on the craft. It continued to hover there 100 feet above the hill in the neighbor's farm field. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The color was a brilliant fiery orange and it looked like there were windows on the upper half of the craft. The light from the craft appeared to have similar characteristics to heat rising from a hot road. We watched the craft from outside our house for about a minute and then went in the house because I believe our parents were worried for our safety. We went in the house and watched the craft hover above that hill for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes it descended and landed behind that hill. We could no longer see the craft , but there was a brilliant halo of light coming up from behind the hill. We watched the area for another 5 minutes and the craft ascended to about 100 feet above the hill again. It continued to hover there (300 yards south of our house) for another 15 minutes, but then flew away to the south and disappeared in the forest in a swampy area south of our farm. The encounter lasted for over 30 minutes and I still remember it vividly even though I was only 5 years old. After the craft left, my parents put us to bed and went to sleep themselves. My dad slept with loaded hunting rifle on their bed. My parents never reported the incident because they thought people would think they were nuts. There were other sightings in the area around that time and the people that made reports were labeled as ODD. My parents never even talked with the neighbors about the encounter to see if they saw the craft which landed about 100 yards in back of their house. My parents still live in that same town, so even 30 years later when we visit Minnesota, we talk about the event and drive past the site.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Twilight Lights in Northfield, MNThis is the discription I wrote about 5-10 minutes after the sighting: &quot;On Monday, September 22, 2003 at 7PM I observed a UFO while on my road. It was a white light, though it may have flickered red, travelling in a straight line at a downward angle of 10°. I observed it for approximately 2-3 seconds, at which time it faded out. At 7:18 the same day I observed two more. The first was heading straight down toward the horizon, and I observed it for several minutes. It was similar in appearence as the one I sighted earlier, except that it did not fade out and definitely flickered beween white, green and red. The second I saw for approximately 3 seconds, and was similar to the earlier sighting except that it faded out, then faded in, travelling on the same trajectory before finally disappearing. &quot; My first instinct (when I saw the first object) was that it was a bit of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. But the two objects I observed later did not quite fit : the one object faded out then in, and the other changed only in it&#39;s color, and I only lost sight of it as it went beneath the horizon. These objects were little more then points of lights - nothing spectacular, but as I say, it was out of the ordinary. (I object to the use of the word craft on this form - it should say object. To call it a craft is to make the assumption that it is a manned transport of some kind, instead of being regarded as an Unknown, which is what it is.)<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> There was a large bright white steady light that I could see behind the trees. At first I thought it was an airplane, but the light nevI was driving home from work at 11:45pm and I saw a large bright light at the end of the dirt road where I lived. It was behind the trees near my driveway and at first I thought it was an airplane but the light never moved. When I pulled into the driveway, I saw that the light had moved. It was now lower in the sky and seemed to be maybe 2 miles to the east of my cabin. It didn't move or flash. Very odd place for a light to be. I had 75 acres of wetland and it adjoined state land which is also wetland for several miles, then forest. I give this description to put into prospective that I lived at the end of dead end road with no souls living to the east of me. The light was steady and was just above the treeline several miles away. I stood in the driveway and watched it for about five minutes. I went inside and let the dog out and then went to the window to look at the light again. It had moved again. It was now north a bit and when I moved my head to get a better view from a different window pane, the light disappeared from view behind an out building. I went back out into the yard to see it again, but the light was gone. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> green fireball with sparks desending slowlyIt was Dec 25th 2003 about 9:40pm very clear night out. I had just come outside with my dog Bippy she really like the snow. I was about to throw a snowball out to Bippy when a big green fireball with sparks stopped me in mid-throw. It was desending at about a 45 degree angl in the northern sky it seems to just go out right before it would have not been visible to me do treeline. At first I thought a meteor then i thought fireworks but i know it wasn't fireworks i've never seen a meteor but i have seen shooting stars and it absolutely wasn't that. It traveled slow and was very vivid with no sound. It did look like it could have been a flare from a flare gun but don't flares leave a big trail of smoke behind? This had no trail only white sparks and the fireball was very green like a green intersection light. It seemed to be farely low in the sky to my location like i could have got in my car and found it with in a few miles. I wouldn't be so curious if it wasn't for all the very similer reports I've been reading on this site. I'm sure i'll hear that other people saw this too. I do remember right after the fireball went out a plane or something high in the sky moving what seemed to me to be very fast for a plane but not unGodly fast across the sky heading in the exact direction where the fireball when out but was very far away to the point where when I notice it seconds after the fireball went out I had turned completely around and was now looking south southwest the fireball was north northeast from me. All i could really see of that was the typical light on it just like on a plane. It just seemed to be moving faster then any plane i've ever seen in that area. mind you i've always been a night sky gazer and at the time was in the backyard of where i live and have lived for the past three years. Never seen anything like that ever or even heard of anything like that before that. Thats why i was surprised to see so many similiar reports.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> luminous orange half-disk winks on then offWhile this report is unlikely to distinguish itself due to it's reatively mundane specifics, it was nevertheless my personal observation of an unknown aireal phenomenon. I should note here, before I discuss the details of the sighting, that there are several important contextual factors that should not go unmentioned. First of all, I am an amateur astonomer. Several thousand hours spent watching the sky have yieled but a single event, an anomoly if you will. The implications of this are open to debate; however, I think these particular noctunal habits strongly suggest the presence of a logical way of observing natural and unnatural (artificial) phenomena. Secondly, I have had cognitive testing performed by a praticing psychologist, and the test results indicated a very high perceptual score. Apparently this psychologist has not seen such a score over the years, save for a "few" other examples. With these factors in mind, hopefully my report will be given serious consideration. As indicated above, this event took place sometime around 1992 or '93. The month was probably July, but it may have been late June or early August as well. I recall it was a clear, moonless (new moon, moon set early, or late rising) night, well after midnight, but not yet near twilight. A light breeze could be heard in the pine and spruce trees. I was alone but with one other person, and we were sitting so that we faced, by chance, westward. My gaze, at one crucial moment, happened to be fixed on the cloudless sky some twenty degrees above the horizion. Very abruptly, as if someone had flipped on a switch, a luminous orange half-disk appeared directly in my line of sight. The half-disk moved parrallel to the horizion, from my right to my left, silent (as far as I could discern) all the while. After but a few seconds, it faded out, and I was to never see it again. I can recall other specifics related to this "object": it was of a luminous, dull orange color (my impression then , as now, is that it was self-luminous) ; it displayed sharp borders all around and seemed quite solid in its makeup ; the flat section was actually slightly concave, thus it wasn't quite a half-disk; it appeared to travel with the aformentioned side in front; it left no trail or train that I could observe; it's apparent size was about 150% of the moon near first-quarter. It is interesting to note that orange half-moons as well as disks are not unknown in UFO literature, however the precise characteristics seem to vary from sighting to sighting. [NUFORC Note: Date and time are approximate. Witness indicates date in both 1980's and 1990's, and we have requested clarification from the party as to in which decade the event occurred. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Sphere<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  about 10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two spheres, one silver, the other emerald. Great speed, seen from 1/4 mile away. I don't recall what day, or exactly what year, however it occurred in January. Whatever the year was, it was the year of comet Hyukutaki, and the date of the occurance was the night that the comet was to be most visible, for our area and weather. I was driving home from work that evening, and in casual observance I was looking to see if I could spot the comet; not realizing that the comet was to be seen in the eastern night sky, and I was travelling west on hwy. 60. As I rounded the corner by Crysteel Manufacturing, I saw a luminescent sphere the color of silver, appear from the northern horizon proceeding to the southern horizon and disappering in the distance. At first sight I thought it was the comet, yet in a split second I realized that it was something else. As I wathced; this object flew "nap of the earth", as it crossed over the expressway it appeared to be 100' above the ground, and was about the size of a quarter in perspective from my distance to it. (1/4 mile) . As it continued its flight south, it crossed over a grove of cottonwood, just grazing the tops and silohueting the branches as it passed each succesive grove of trees. The length of time that I observed this was about 6 maybe 7 seconds, and the distance that it travelled from one horizon to the other is about 6+ miles. Naturally I was in disbeleif of what I saw, even though I knew I saw "something", when about 3 seconds later the second object dropped out of the sky in a very steep angle, as if it had been waiting for the other, and proceeded in the same direction, but with greater speed; the bottom of the second object was at the same tree top height above the ground. This second object was a sphere as well, only of greater magnitude, about football field in diameter. The color of the second sphere was this amazingly emerald green. To this day, I am still amused by the fact that I saw these two objects that were purposefully flying towards some objective, and that they definetly were not some natural phenomenom that were just ambling throught the air! I also cannot get over how pristine and intense the colors of these objects were; that the colors were not necesarily a surface coloration, but rather a luminuous glow emminating from a reflective metalic surface, like the color you get from anodized metal. [NUFORC Note: We believe the comet was visible in the spring of 1997. We have amended the date above. PD]<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  approx: 5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> V Shaped Lights. Photos can be viewed at: http://www. hbccufo. com/index. php I have continued to see various assorted craft off and on for well, years. Tonights craft was particulary interesting because of the apparent shape. Which was different to me. I noticed a bright flash and went for my camera. The lights hovered in the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and then diappeared by imploding or shutting off all at once. Let me know what enhancements might show on this. Additional Information Below&quot; In describing the brilliant flash - I would say an electric white/blue, as lightening. In describing movement – It would be best to say it was like something that had been moving very fast and suddenly stopping. It had a hanging sense to it as if an unstable slight spin. The turning was slow and it gave an appearance of adjusting the actual lights. The lights appeared to have a sequencing effect. To say they went from odd positions to a more uniform alignment. After they came into &#39;straight line&#39; forming a V with an odd nose. A &#39;W&#39; type of nose. Then they just faded down and a quick white/blue flash and it was gone. I do not know what direction it came from. I can only say it &#39;materialised&#39; in the eastern sky. With the exception of maneuvering the lights it made no drastic moves. I do not know which way it went because it seemed to implode or leave in the manner in which it appeared. Flash and gone. The sky was clear. All other natural and satellite features were in normal placement. The temperature was in the 20&#39;sF. Slight breeze. To take a wild guess as to elevation of object I would say just above small craft path. The placement was toward the lake. I think it was above the lake. The lake is 7 blocks east downhill from my home. To describe structure I would call it a very interesting bit of &#39;piecework&#39;. I mean to say it was not in alignment when it first &#39;appeared&#39;. It performed some kind of structuring act. It may be best to call it W shaped. I say that because though it was V in overall shape, at least by the manipulating of the lights it also formed an indent like the W or a ^ at the V center. I did not detect any sound other then a humming sensation at the top of my head. Myself and my dog and cat were the witnesses for this that I am aware of. The cat a HUGE Orange Tom Tabby went to the west in the bit of thicket to hunt. The dog a miniature Schnauzer/Lhasa (Benji) was mildly distressed. He could hear something and wanted to go into the house. He growled for sometime but that could be because he does not like his cat to be hunting in the dark! We have sighted strange black dogs…they look like hienna&#39;s in stature, they stalk the deer trail through the west hillside. Thank you for your time. I bring this one up because its shape was new to me. I see allot of oval shaped objects and Spheres. Orbs abound! I stand contrary to ALL digital orbs being Blurfos. I have seen hundreds of orbs pass through this part of the world. They can be seen with the naked eye. They are not an aftershot. Another words they are there before a picture is even taken. I have seen &#39;cloud&#39; forms in a number of locations in this area. They appear to be intelligent and have a set purpose what that purpose is…I do not profess to know! Hope all is well or as well as can be for you and yours Brian. Thank you to the witness for the report. HBCC UFO Is following up on this report.

<b>REPORTED:</b>  2/13/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I was on a farm in northern minnesota and just happened to glance up at the sky, I saw the big dipper and noticed three star sized lights moving past the tail of the bug dipper. they were in formation with each other moving very fast and flawlessly stayed the same distance from each other, they did move apart and back close. they went from one end of the big dipper all the way to the southern horizon then looped back to the north, then continued to "swim throught" the sky like fish in a pond before dispering over the western horizon. I have been a star gazer my whole life and ive seen many satelites and shooting stars and many airplanes fly across the night sky, I worked for a major airline for five years so I am very familar with planes and how fast they move across the sky and these lights were not any airplane Know of, In fact they seemed to move three to four times as fast as a plane crusing at 40, 000 feet. It couldnt have been more than five minutes, and they crossed the entire sky twice. The lights appeared to be the same size as an average star and if I had to guess at the elevation I would say they were as high as our satelites. there were no sounds emmiting from them, and if a jet flys over here I always heere them.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  15 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two large lights above the treetops about 150 feet from our car that radiated light that affected my wife and IMy wife and I were driving home on a Fayal Township road about six miles Southeast of Eveleth, MN. We were about one-half mile from home and traveling North about 30 mph when we both noticed two large white lights slightly above the treetops near the right side (East) of the road. My wife asked me what it was. My first thought was that they were the landing lights of an airplane which had just taken off from a nearby airport. I slowed down our car and rolled down the window, but we could hear no sound of an airplane. My wife glanced at the dashboard to see if the lights were affecting the electrical system of the car and they weren't, but she noticed the time was 7:11 pm. As we drove along slowly we noticed that the lights were only about 150 feet away from our car. Then I saw a dimmer red flashing light between the large lights which appeared to be about two feet in diameter and about ten feet apart. The white lights suddenly turned bluish white and seemed to grow in size and radiate from the object and at that instant I felt overcome by the early stages of sleep paralysis. I immediately floored the gas pedal and as we got away from the lights the sleep paralysis subsided. The experience lasted about 15 seconds. When we got home we wrote down separately what we had just seen and then compared notes. My wife said the lights were stationary thoughout the experience hovering above the treetops. She did not notice any change in color of the lights, but that there was white light projected from the two large lights and lit up the treetops brightly. She saw red lights between the two large white light, but did not see them flash. My wife described feeling as beening possessed or under hypnosis during the experience. There didn't seem to be any missing time as it was 7:20 pm when we were writing our notes of the experience. The skies were clear.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  15-20min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Possible prior sighting similar to 16 Feb 2004 Amityville, NYOn this night my girlfriend and I were camping in the back 40 of a friends farm and had gone out raccoon hunting. About 01:30 we decided to call it a night and started walking back to our tent which was across a hay field from the woods we were in. As we got to the tent I turned and looked to the east and saw what I thought were aircraft wingtip strobes out about 2-3 miles. I didn't think much of it at the time so we went about getting the rifles cleaned and put away for the night. For some reason I looked back in that same direction about 5 minutes later and the lights were still there. I brought this to my girlfriends attention and had her hand me my rifle scope. I removed the red dot sight, attached the scope to the rifle, and set the bipod on the car roof to get a steady look at this strange set of lights. When I got the scope on the lights the were not in fact sitting still but moving very slightly from side to side. I thought that could be from my breathing but then remembered that I had set the bipod. I told her it must be a helicopter just hovering out there for some reason and put the rifle away. As we turned back to watch it some more, it moved about a half mile from it's original position and then started west. I told her, I guess now we'll find out what it is. Whatever it was passed about a quarter mile to the north of us in just a few seconds, and it made no sound at all, no rotor noise, no engine noise. We looked at each other and I asked if she'd heard anything and she said no. Well, we both got the willies and decided that we were definatly calling it a night and went to bed. I thought that I would share this with you because I just read the report from Amityville, NY. We weren't able to see a shape but I don't know of any aircraft military or civilian that can move that fast without any sound.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Cromwell, Minnesota. . . . Deer Hunting Opening Day. . . . Carlton County Movings LightsOn the Opening Day of Deer Hunting of fall 2003 in Minnesota. I got up at 5:00 and headed out to my deer stand with my . 308. I got up ito my deer stand which was in a woody, hilly area and noticed a star looking figure that was moving around in a busy movement. I just didn't what the heck it was, so I looked up at it with my high powered scope and it basicly looked like a star. Later, another star light popped up and then the two went slowly away from me and dissapeared just as the light day was starting to appear. I told my dad this later in the day and he thought that it was wierd. I know this for sure, for those last two weeks of hunting I watched the skies and saw many more sightings of the same kind, and I have been a little scared since the incidents. I would really like to know what these occurences are. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

When we went to the window we saw a Long skinny Rectangular shape (roughly 100 feet above us) , it was VERTICAL, roughly 15 feet in length, with several (maybe 6 or more) lights on it. The lights were all a very bright white and they were flashing and strobing. The light would start on the bottom and was strobbing and getting progressively brighter as it went up. Then it would repeat this. It made no noise. It looked like a floating rectangle. We watched it strob and flash as it flew off to the east horizon.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  4/3/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Formation<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  three minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The witness for the sighting below are referring to the sighting report which took place on March 31, 2004 and the witnesses to that case had taken a number of photos of what they saw. Also a link to the March 31, 2004 sighting is included in this new report below. My wife and I saw the exact same thing over downtown St Paul last night heading south around 8:30 PM. We believe it was a flock of geese flying at a high elevation that were catching the last rays of sunlight. Additional Information Below: We live in a high rise in downtown St Paul, Minnesota, so I believe we have a different vantage point from which to view the phenomena than someone on the ground would have. At approximately 8:30 PM on Thursday we went out on our balcony to have a cigarette. The sun had set and it was fairly dark. My wife noticed the flying &quot;V&quot; formation heading due south. The sight was identical to the picture you posted on Rense. com. or here at: http://www. hbccufo. com/modules. php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1150 She pointed it out to me and we stared at it. Our initial thought was that it was a UFO. But as we observed for about three minutes we noticed that the formation metamorphised into a sloppy looking &quot;W&quot;. Then we saw a piece of it break off and go to the other side forming a lopsided &quot;V&quot; formation again. There was a cloud formation to the southeast that was slightly illuminated on the top as well. Both the formation and the cloud to the southeast faded out simultaneously. There is a large Canadian goose population around here. Typically we can see flocks flying south near the end of the evening. Based on our observation we thought that the &quot;V&quot; was a flock of geese flying at a higher than normal elevation and they were catching the last rays of light on their underbellies. Again, we could be wrong. I have seen unexplained sights in the sky before but this was the first time I had ever seen an illuminated flying &quot;V&quot;. In this particular instance though, I think that the sight we saw probably had a natural explanation. It may very well be that what you observed portrayed different characteristics and was not the same phenomenon we observed. I wish you luck in solving the mystery.

<b>REPORTED:</b>  3/23/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  6 to 7 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A triangular, slow moving, silent, lighted with 6 lights on base with green and blue being dominate, subdued yellow and red also, On this night My fiance', her daughter and myself winessed a triangular object traveling NE over Oakdale MN. It passed directly over our vehicle as we were driving due south. We seen it initially comming towards us about 2 or 3 miles away. I said to my fiance, "look, theres a UFO". In jest at first because we are both sky-watchers. I said this because I am not used to seeing aircraft with dominate blue and green lights on it. There were 6 lights visible from the bottom of the craft. Two lights 1 blue and 1 green that were dominate. There were 3 yellow/white lights about 1/3 as bright as the green and blue lights. Also a slightly fainter red light. The red light was on the leading edge of the triangle at the apex. 2/3's of the way back to the base of the triangle were the green and blue lights nearer to the edges. At the base were the 3 yellow/white lights located centered on the base between the green and blue lights. As it came closer and then right over us it was very clear that this was not a helicopter because my best guess would be that it couldn't be more than 1200 feet in the air and there was no sound. I seemed to be going no mre than 80 miles per hour. I turned around to follow it and kept up pretty well at 50 MPH. I was in a residential area and soon had to stop. We stopped abd watched it for several minutes and seen 1 helicopter going from SE to NW seemingly going towards this object. There was also another helicopter going directly N and to our left that seemed to be headed in that direction also. It was very easy to hear and see that these were helicopters as we were stopped now with the windows down. As the object in question reached about 5 miles to our north it started to change direction to more northwesterly as opposed to NE. It made a apparently very slow turn, but as I was so far to the south of it. . . . it could have just been the distance that made it look slow. Ater that we were unable to see the object. We decided at this time to go back to our home! I am former Air force and have a better than average knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics. . . this is the first time I was stumped ;)<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  5/5/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Sphere<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Commuting home from work during an ice storm I encountered a UFO. I have this information in my word processing program. I would prefer to send you hard copy of the events. I saw them on two different occasions exactly 1 week apart at approximately 5:30 AM The first one was 15 miles away from the second one. The first one was approximately the size of a medcine ball, the second was different. It was shaped like a set of bar bells, 15&quot; spheres separated by a 12&quot; bar of glowing light. The light was a gloden glow like the filament of light bulbs. Had my car windows been open I could have reached out and touched either of them, therefore, they had to be within 2&quot; of my face. Both objects glowed like the filament of a light bulb. Both were silent. The first or perhaps both of them were highly energized. The first one occurred during an ice storm. My boss sent me home from work early due to the weather. I was a bit out of Coates, Minnesota southbound on Hwys 52 &amp; 56 when I noticed this large ball of light drifting across the field towards me. Due to the foul weather I was only driving 15 or 20 miles per hour, the UFO I would guess was going about the same speed. The road was very icy and I couldn&#39;t stop. It was so icy the car was sheathed in a coat of ice 1/4&quot; or more thick. The ice hadn&#39;t even melted directly over the center of the engine after having traveled about 15 miles from my work place. The ball came across the field, into the ditch and up onto the road. I thought it was some form of ball lightening though I had never seen that phenomena previously. It came across the shoulder and onto the pavement. I couldn&#39;t stop because of icy road conditions. Also, I thought I&#39;m in a car with four good rubber tires under me and as soon as this &quot;lightening&quot; touched the car it would dissipate. The ball came up the corner of the car and across the hood at a diagonal. It just missed the corner post on the driver&#39;s side of the car. It then went down the side of the car and continued across the highway and the field on that side. It continued on it&#39;s path from the southeast to the northeast. During it&#39;s transit, the car engine cut out cold. I don&#39;t recall if I had to restart it as the car did keep moving, I may have turned the key again to start it. Where it had come across the hood the metal was instantly dry. The right side of the hood was still encased in ice. The edge of the &#39;cut&#39; was smooth as if cut by a knife. The rest of the ice remained on the car for several hours after I arrived home, my husband commented on the dry section and remaining ice when he saw the car. Precisely one week later, same time of day, 15 miles south of the first encounter and on my own street, 1/2 mile east of my home, another UFO appeared. This was the one shaped like two basketballs with a bar between them. This one circled the car twice as if pearing in on me and checking my out. Why, I don&#39;t know, but nine months later I gave birth to my only child. The car was a 52 Chevy in almost new condition. The contact melted the component where all the wires and distribution system for the electrical system was. The annoyance from all electrical components malfunctioning repeatedly after that got to be too frustrating for us and we got another car. Two men in black did come to my door following this incident. I didn&#39;t want to get involved with them and I told them I thought it was two incidents related to ball lightening. However, I have lived a lot of years since and have never met with the same phenomena since. Unbeknownest to me, I had serious birth defects in my reproductive system. When the doctors finally found them and removed my uterus; they were amazed that I had been able to have a child at all. When this boy and I were younger we both could change traffic lights at will, switching the lights from red to green. Since then there have been changes made in traffic control technology and that is no longer possible.<br>

After the helicopter flew from view I saw a burnt orange object flying from the same direction the helicopter came from (west-northwest) and flying in the same direction (southeast) on a parallel flight path just north of the helicopter's flight path. The orange craft appeared to move at 1. 5 times the speed of the helicopter and it made no sound. It appeared diamond shape as it flew away, but from the side, as it passed, it appeared more like a flattened ball. I was impressed at its smooth flight characteristics and that it made no sound.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5-6 Seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangle shaped object traveling east to west approximately 45 degrees above northern horizon. While observing an unusually strong display of aurora borealis I noticed an object traveling from east to west approximately 45 degrees above the northern horizon. This object traveled across approximately 90 degrees of visible sky before I lost it behind ground clutter. The best description I can give would be a plastic coat hanger with the hook at the top removed, leaving a flattened triangle with rounded corners. It appeared to be either clear like acrylic with many small lights inside, or perhaps a light gray that matched the background sky color with a highly reflective surface in which case the many small lights may have been reflections of ground lights. I have been an aviation buff for most of my life and this was no aircraft I have ever seen. While the shape was reminiscient of a hanglider there was no "swooping motion" typical of "kites". Since there was no sound it couldn't have been an ultralight either, they use very noisy small engines and this was silent. The movement was straight and level so must have been powered flight. the size at arm length appeared to be about three inches wingtip to wingtip and about one inch nose to tail. While I can't say the exact distance from me I have the impression this was about the size of a small private aircraft which would give it an altitude of a few hundred feet, certainly low enough to hear engines or see someone hanging below a hanglider. Speed would be hard to estimate, but it only took five or six seconds to cross my line of sight, much faster than any private plane. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

<b>REPORTED:</b>  4/13/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  1 hour or so<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Their was a green fog. I saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material. It was a week night in September of 1976. My Daughter M had just started kindergarten. I was married to B. We were living in a little house on Seminary Dr. in St. Paul, MN. We had gone to bed about 9:30, as we usually did on week nights. It was probably several hours later when I woke with a start to find that B was not in bed with me. This would not have been unusual except that he had to work the next morning. I walked through the house stopping to check on M, who, was missing from her bed. While B being gone was not much cause for concern, he would never, on the longest day of his life, have taken a 5 year old with him. I began to panic. I ran to the back door with the intention of looking to see if our van or car were gone, when I opened it there was a green haze or fog which was quite thick. My dog ran out into the yard, I screamed for him to come back which he did. My panic turning into terror, I picked up the phone but put it back down. Who would I call, and what would I tell them? That my Daughter and Husband were missing, and my house was enveloped in a green fog? Right. I went to the kitchen sink, which was clear of dishes, and splashed my face with cold water in a vane attempt to compose myself. I got a glass of water, drank it and put the glass down on the right side of the sink. At this point I was snot nosed and sniveling. I paced the length of our small house repeatedly, stopping to look in M&#39;s room. Was I having some sort of bizarre psychotic episode, or was this just a terrible nightmare? Yes, the Granddaddy of all nightmares. With this in mind I went back to bed. I lay there in a sweat, with my eyes tightly shut,  saying to myself, between heaving sobs,  &quot;This is just a bad dream, this is just a bad dream&quot; At some point I noticed that the lights were on in my bedroom. I didn&#39;t recall turning them on. Our security light and the corner street lamp provided more than enough illumination to see most everywhere in the house. I looked down toward the end of the bed and to my horror saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material. I opened my mouth to scream. Nothing but a wheezing whimper would pass my lips. Truly frozen with fear, I was pumping adrenaline at a rate I thought might kill me. My heart wasn&#39;t beating, it was buzzing. Some time passed before I was able to move one of my feet, very slowly, out of the fetal position to push this object further away from me. I don&#39;t remember a thing after that until daylight when I awoke to find that B was in bed beside me. I raced to M&#39;s Room where she lay sleeping peacefully. As I walked back to the bedroom I glanced at the sink. There was my glass, on the right side. The light in the bedroom was off. I glanced in a mirror and noticed my face appeared sunburnt. At breakfast I could see that M and B looked sunburnt too. I recall thinking to myself that it had been cloudy and cold all week. I pushed this incident to the back of my mind in a category all it&#39;s own labeled &quot;Nightmare like no other&quot; and went on with my life. A few years later as I sat in a Dentist&#39;s waiting room (in San Diego) paging through a magazine, I noticed an article that pretty nearly described my ordeal. Intrigued, I stopped at a book store on my way home. As I looked through the books on UFO&#39;s and the like I came across some drawings of odd looking, supposed, human/alien infants. One was of a red haired baby wrapped in an oval shaped goldish colored blanket. Looking back on the events of that night, I wish that I hadn&#39;t been so fearful and that I would have closely examined that oval shaped object. Anyone out there had a similar experience? If so I would like to hear from you. Thanks, R[NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

I could just barely make out the outline against the night sky. In the center was a dimly lit round red window or light. . the object appeared to be a couple hundred feet high; perhaps 70-100 feet from tip to tip; while hovering the object made a slight circular motion. The circles became larger in diameter; it then made a spiraling maneuver and sped off like a bullet to the south over the trees in the woods behind my house. (I live on a wooded 1-acre lot in a semi-metropolitan area) . This whole time, the object made no sound. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The stars were very bright, even when you have the City lights surrounding you. Just finished up work and went outside for a cigarette. I glance up in the sky and where I'm standing I see a bright sparkle light the size as if it's a moving star going in a sparadic speed. Location to my best descrpition would be Southeast and up passing one of the planets (Can't name the bright star at that time) . What was odd about this light is when it passed this star it then went to an incredible "halt". And did not move for another 20 minutes. Too tired, went to bed. What I find weird is this pattern of this particular "light" has been going on for years. Has anyone else around the area seen these "moving lights that go then stop"?<br>

Date of Sighting: 5/19/4 Time of Sighting: about 6:45 Location of Sighting: 1/2 mile in Back of mt of house Number of witnesses: 3 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: circle Full Description of event/sighting: It was raining hard and I needed a smoke so I thought I would sit in my car. (It was still daylight out.) I was only out there about 3 minutes or so when I noticed a white, round light in the sky with what had appeared to be smoke by it, I couldn't give a size but it was smaller than half of the sun a perfect circle it was. It did not move. Not knowing what it was I ran in the house and yelled to my brother and my husband to come and look but by the time they reached the window facing that direction they could see the smoke that was still there, and no light object, and just to note the smoke seen was not coming from the ground or from any direction if was just around the object. I know what I saw was a light not a plane or anything like that it just sat in the same place. I know it was not there when I first stepped outside because it was just that noticeable. I then called non-emergency police department in Fairmont to see if maybe any one had reported seeing anything in sky she told me no and I replied I don't want to tell you what I saw because I think you would think I was crazy.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  30 min.<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It was the strangest blue light we had ever seen and then it changed and started following us all the way home. My friend and I were coming home from a casino taking the back roads home as we normally do. It was a bright night out-almost a full moon and the stars were very bright. Very clear. We were coming up a hill and at the top of the hill on the other side of a row of trees was a bright blue light. I was driving slow because the area is known for alot of deer. The light was nothing I had seen before and I asked my friend to look at it. I slowed down to almost a stop and observed it for a short time. We were talking about it being a strobe light like on a police car or something, but it was solid blue and wasn't emitting light in a fixed manner. It was almost throwing light like a laser but like ribbons of light. It didn't light up the field it was in so you couldn't see what it was attached to. We discussed it being a tractor but the light was so weird I had never seen anything like it before. Then the light started coming straight towards us at a fast rate and I freaked. I hit the gas and started down the road. I told her to keep watching it and tell me what it does. We came upon another hill so we lost sight of it for a second then she said that it must have been an airplane because it's in the sky now. I asked her what it looked like (I couldn't see it-we had an old Rambler car and I'm missing the side mirror) . She said she wasn't sure what kind of plane or what it was. Then I told her I would stop and take a look. We slowed down and I rolled my window down and I looked out and I knew immediately it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. It had two panels of light on it and they were changing colors randomly from left to right. They would be green, yellow, red, white, orange and blue. At this point I had no doubt in my mind what it was we were observing. We were a ways from the next town and no cars on the road so I drove the old Rambler as fast as it would allow. The thing in the sky followed us at a distance of maybe a mile. When we came to the next intersection and I had to turn it turned wi! th us and kept following us out the right side. It stayed a mile away from us at all times until we got to the next town. There is a lake there and it was hovering over the lake and that is the closest it got to us. We got to a major highway 4 miles down the road. I figured we would wait for a car and follow it. We waited at the stop sign but nobody came so we sat and watched for it and it appeared north of us again. I sped out for home-15 miles. My friend saw it only once in the next 4 miles. It stopped dead in the sky and headed due east and a high rate of speed. We had to go through another small town to get home yet and nobody was in sight so we kept speeding home. We never saw it again until we got home and it was coming at us about 1-2 miles out over town. The lights were doing the same thing on it the whole time it followed us. We were so freaked out we headed home and ran in the house and thought about what to do next. We went into the yard after our blood pressure came down to look for it but nothing but stars and the moon. Thank God.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 2 flashing lights in the sky, circle counter clockwise one on right goes behind moon and they moved away from each otherTwo "crafts" that looked like bright white stars stood out on the left side of the crescent moon. The lights flashed brightly every few seconds, bright as two headlights on an approaching car. This is the best way I can describe them. They were really bright, but not bright enough to light up the sky. They began to circle each other, very slowly in a clockwise direction. The lights crept away from each other across the horizon. The light that was moving to the right made me think. The shadow on the moon is cast by the earth. The flashing light did not show up on the shadow. That light must have traveled behind the moon. I'm not sure the exact date of this experience but my mom and i were putting the sprinklers away for the night so i assume it was late august or more towards early spring perhaps april or may. Everyone i talked to about this said they had never heard of anything like it. We should've reported it as soon as it happened, but we didn't and i've been trying to figure out what the lights could've been ever since. I'm curious if anyone else has ever seen ne thing like this. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> ENCOUNTERED UFO THAT APPROACHED WITHIN 50 FEET, WAS 30 FEET WIDE AND REMAINED FOR OVER 30 MINUTES. FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE OBJECT SOME 1000 FEET DISTANT UP THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF A HILL. IT CAME DOWN THE ROAD EAST TO WEST VERY SLOWLY NEAR TO THE GROUND. IT HAD 7 LARGE LIGHTS 4 BELOW, AND 3 ABOVE. THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE WITH THIN RAYS RADIATING ALL AROUND. THEY WERE VERY BRIGHT BUT ONLY CASTE A BLUE REFLECTION ON THE TREES AND ROAD. I STOOD IN THE ROAD AS IT CAME TOWARDS ME. IT STOPPED SOME 200 FEET DISTANT AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS. THERE WAS NO SOUND. I STUDIED THE OBJECT FOR SOME 10 OR 15 MINUTES AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE TOWARDS IT SLOWLY. AS I APPROACHED TO WITHIN 50 FEET IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY BACKWARDS UNTIL IT WAS IN LINE WITH MY NEIGHBORS DRIVEWAY THAT CUT A SWATH IN THE PINETREES. AS I WAS APPROACHING CLOSER IT SUDDENLY SHOT SIDEWAYS UP THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE SKY AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. THE ONLY SOUND WAS A PPPPHHHTTTT!!!! AS IT SHOT AWAY. I FELT NO BACKDRAFT OR MOVEMENT IN THE AIR. IT HAD JUST QUIT RAINING THAT EVENING AND I TOOK A FLASHLIGHT AND CHECKED THE ROAD FOR TRACKS--THERE WERE NONE. ONLY ROCKS HAD SLID FROM THE CENTER OF THE ROAD TO THE SIDES IN THE WET GRAVEL. I WENT HOME. THE NEXT MORINING I FOUND A DEAD SKUNK BY THE ROAD WITH THE HAIR STRANDS CORRECTLY IN PLACE BUT NO BODY, SKIN, OR BONES. THERE WAS A WET SPOT SURROUNDING THE REMAINS. I TOOK A PHOTO OF THIS PHENOMENON. A FEW NIGHTS LATER AT 3:00 I AWOKE TO A BEATIFUL LIGHT WITH PINK AND BLUE SWIRLS IN IT. I FOUND I HAD A TRIANGULAR BURN ON MY LEFT WRIST THAT LASTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AS A BURN AND IS STILL ON MY ARM TODAY. SOMETIMES IT GROWS FROM ONE CENTIMETER TO OVER AN INCH AS A PINK RASH. THERE ARE 3 POINTS AT THE CORNERS. THERE WERE SEVERAL RELATED EXPERIENCES THAT SUMMER WITH WITNESSES INCLUDING MY OWN SON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I WISH TO ADD MY; PUZZLEMENT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE OR NO INTEREST IN MY STORY WHICH I FEEL WAS QUITE SINGULAR--PLUS THE FACT THAT I AM AN INTERNATIONAL ARTIST WHO HAD A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME TO VISUALLY RECORD THE SIGHTING. I HAVE PAINTED A PHOTOGRAPHIC LIKENESS OF THE CRAFT WHICH NO ONE SEEMS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT. FURTHERMORE, I SEEK NO PERSONAL RECOGNITION IN THIS CASE AND AM QUITE CONTENT TO REMAIN INCOGNITO.<br>

The time of day is also uncertain, but was after midnight. I should also mention that since early childhood I would not go to sleep unless the shade in my room was pulled because I was afraid of "eyes" looking at me. I awoke due to a odd pulsating, whirring sound and noticed flickering lights on my window shade. I called to my father, who was sleeping on the couch in the living room (due to my mother not feeling well) , but all he did was mumble incomprehensibly. I was very fightened and simply covered up my head with a blanket. I don't recall if I mentioned this to my parents in the morning. [NUFORC Note: Time and date are approximate. PD]<br>

As we woke up and looked up we noticed some strange lights in the air. We yelled for my friends parents. His parent came out and we just stood and watched these strange lights in the air. They were sort of a greenish tinted light. The 12 lights were an oval shapped and did not look real big. From our view they looked about 1 centimeter. So if they were up close i would have to guess they were all about the size of a small jet. This unidentified object sat still for approximitly 2 minutes. Then in an instant, they just vanished.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two possible craft seen in the mid-afternoon sky following the MississippiI might be looking toohard but I just saw another one. It flew as gracefully as a bird, incidentally one of the reasons this may be a misidentification. The craft was in the shape of a black wing. It flew around in circles first up the Mississippi toward me, asscending some. At its closest point, I saw what seemed to be manufactured rather than somethin of God's hand. If it was a bird, it would have been close enough to make out more clearly. I could see that it was shaped as a wing, and looked further off. Then for about four minutes, I watched as it turned and moved southward away from me along the river. During the ladder half of this encounter, it was joined by a smaller object, along the treeline. Taking thermals into account, this corse makes me wonder if I did see anything this time, after all if I did, then its the second time this week. I also made a report on Tuesday<br>

It never hit the clouds, so i can say its size was smaller then the passenger airplanes (more than twice) , it was flying approximately twice the speed of the planes (constant speed) , but i didn't have any means to capture the image.

At around 3:30 pm or son on thrusday i was riding in a car and heard on AM talk radio they were talking about people looking up at something in the sky and there were some crashes from people looking and to pay attention to driving etc. well i finally stuck my head out the window and after only a few seconds spotted what appeared to be a star in the day sky. I dont know if this was a weather balloon or what but it stayed there for hours the last time i looked it was starting to get dark out and it was still there (there were no other stars yet) I took many pictures of this and can provide them to anyone who wants. it even made the local news for a while but they dont seem to be talking about it anymore. The object did seem to move very slowly in the sky over a period of many hours but i dont understand how any weather balloon could move so slowly and be visible for so long. I have no idea the altitude but i would imagine it was really high, probally 100, 000 feet and the object must have been huge. There were some reports from aircraft at 35, 000 that said it was still just a dot from up there. i observed it for periods of ten minutes at a time or so between going in my house and calling people to tell them to look etc. It did seem to change shape ever so slightly like it became elongated (such as what a weather ballon would do) it also appeared to emit small pulses of light off it. [NUFORC Note: One of several reports from the Twin Cities area. At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.

The bright light gained in intesity for a period of maybe two seconds. It appeared to be mostly white. It was almost like having a heavenly flashlight shined in your face it was so bright. And then the light dimmed until I saw only a small point of light like a satellite. The pinpoint of light then traveled southeast at about satellite speed, but then seemed to raise in elevation until it disappeared. About 15 minutes later a similar object appeared.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw something extraordinaryI was walking to work, took a shortcut through a wooded area adjacent to a cemetary. I walked down a dirt track towards the cemetary, there was a large alfalfa field to my left forming a gradual downward slope. It was still dark, just a hint of light on the horizon. I sensed, or heard something, like a strong breeze moving the trees in the woodline to my left, as I turned to the left, looking downhill, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Feeling spooked, I turned to keep walking. A dark moving shape came from my left side, rising quickly, traveling to the right. I saw it best when it was about at my ten o'clock high position. It looked like a Huey helicopter, with a similar style windscreen, towards the front, the rest of the craft reminded me most of a Star Trek shuttle craft, but it was very dark in color, and I only caught a glimpse. It hung in the air with a nose down attitude, like a helicopter taking off, then, was gone. I saw it only for in instant, it made absolutely no sound. I didn't really see it fly in any direction. It was just there for an instant, then gone. It just seemed to "flash" away, although it emitted no light. My heart was racing, though I did not feel afraid, just excited. After I walked the 2 miles to work, where at the time I was a clean up boy at a bakery, I remember telling a co-worker, I saw something really strange this morning. . .

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This item is from WCCO news in Minneapolis MnThere's an unknown object hovering in the sky over the Twin Cities, and it doesn't appear to be a bird or a plane. Meteorologist Tony Zaleski of the National Weather Service in Chanhassen says the white object appears to be higher than the white, whispy cirrus clouds, which means it's probably higher than 30, 000 feet. Although the object looked like it might be rotating, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Zaleski says that probably would rule out a satellite. Patrick Hogan at the Metropolitan Airports Commission says folks in the tower at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport thought it might be a weather balloon. But Zaleski says if that's true, the Weather Service didn't release it. The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't returned calls about the mysterious object. [NUFORC Note: One of several reports from the Twin Cities area. At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> White circular object observed 2. 5 handspans above horizon for 4+ hours by 8 people in St. Paul, MN. Some friends and I were all at a backyard barbeque and one of the guys there asked if I had seen the UFO yet. I was puzzled and he explained that on WCCO they had reported a white floating thing that hadn't moved for hours. We all went outside and watched it for a good for hours while we cooked up our food. The neighbors in the next door yard had a pair of 7x35 binoculars they were using to look at the object and let us take a look. I saw what appeared to be a pale white orb that was a bit stretched out on the top side. Like a blunted teardrop, kind of. The object appeared to be stationary but during the course of our BBQ, it appeared to have moved from 12 o'clock to about 10 o'clock at a uniform height of 2. 5 handspans (arms extended) above the horizon. A dime held at arms length completely obscured the object. I believe that even a popcorn kernel held at arm's length would have covered it. 3 of the 8 of us had about 3 beers apiece over the course of the 4 hours. As to our credibility, we are all of sound mind. I am a military veteran, one of the guys there is a Mennonite/Quaker type guy, one lady is a research biologist, and another works in a health diagnostic lab. The remainder were college students. Everyone there was of a rational mindset. In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can't quite explain. The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true. Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white "circloid" with no noticable shading. To be honest, we got bored with it after a while and ceased to pay attention to it. Prior to this we noted it had been drifting relative to the trees. Left to right, facing west. When we wondered about it's position around 2100 hours, we weren't able to find it. [NUFORC Note: We presume the date indicated above is correct, but a similar event occurred near the Twin Cities on August 19. We will contact the witness for clarification. Several news outlets reported the incident, and it remains unexplained, according to two of those media, as of September 8, 2004. PD][ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS]Peter-Yeah, it was Aug 19. . . the day everyone around here was seeing it. Sorry about that, I don't usually keep track of the date. It was all over the radio, TV. . . and then interest just disappeared. Odd, you'd think that folks would be interested in knowing what the heck was just floating stationary for such a long period of time. Most folks just dismissed it with "weather balloon". It might have been but it certainly didn't exhibit balloon like properties, chiefly that whole "not moving" thing. Let me know if you learn any more about the flying object that has, to date, been unidentified. Cheers! [name deleted][END ADDENDUM]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> White high-altitude object suspended over Twin Cities and witnessed for 12 hoursOn the 19th of August, I witnessed a round white object over the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) area around 18:00. The earliest reports I heard were 9am in the morning and it was there until dark. I personally did not hear about it until around 6pm in the evening when a small blurb was mentioned on the radio. The object drifted slowly but not very far while under my observations and exhibited no unusual characteristics that one would expect if this were a high-altitude research balloon. The meteorologists from the local TV stations said that it was above the cirrus clouds indicating an altitude greater than 30, 000. This would make the object VERY big indeed. A local person with a high-powered telescope viewing it said it did indeed look like a balloon. Perhaps that would satisfy most people's questions, but how does an untethered balloon stay in basically the same position for at LEAST 12 hours in a row? Especially in the Midwest where fronts are blowing through every few days? Perhaps it was the center of a very slow moving low pressure system? Officially, NO ONE has claimed ownership for the object and there has been NO official explaination. Here are some links to various local TV stations that covered (briefly) the event: http://wcco. com/localnews/local_story_232202348. html http://www. startribune. com/stories/462/4938203. html http://www. kstptv5. com/article/stories/s1972. html http://www. coasttocoastam. com/shows/2004/08/20. html#ufo http://www. visi. com/~rschwa/arspix/IMG_2068.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Video of object over the Minneapolis metro area on 8-19-04I first learned of the object when my brother phoned to say it was on the local news. I stepped out onto my front porch and looked toward the north up at maybe a 60 degree angle. It was very easy to see. Here is a video I took of it. . . www. kevinandtammy. net/video/ufo. asx The video causes the object to appear smaller than it did to the naked eye. To get a better apporximation, hold a pea at arms length and that would be similar in size to the object in the sky. The pea would be maybe just a bit larger. I'm an air traffic controller and I'm not aware of our center tracking any aircraft which may have been dispatched to investigate it further. Upon learning of the object and hearing that it may be a weather balloon, I phoned work to find out what the upper winds were doing. From the mid levels up to 60, 000ft the winds were steady out of the west at 60 knots. Had the object in the sky been a balloon I would think it would have drifted in the direction of the wind. This object hovered for hours with very little movement. If anything, it moved in a very slow southwestward direction.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Disk Shaped Craft Hovering over Farm[name deleted/male] sighting occurred during the summer of 1975 within a few miles of his home in Ramsey, MN (25 miles Northwest of Minneapolis.) He was 13 years old at the time and was on his way to the [deleted] Church with his two sisters around 6:30PM. As his oldest sister was driving North on Anoka County Road 5 they all noticed cars pulled over to the shoulder on each side of the road near the 167th Avenue NW intersection. Fearing an accident had occurred she slowed the vehicle down as they neared the intersection. However, to their surprise, no cars seemed to be damaged and the occupants of the parked vehicles were standing outside gazing up into the Western sky. Just about the time they passed the crossing, [witness] looked out his passenger window and saw what appeared to be a large disk shaped craft which he estimated to be around the size of 2 Rambler homes (250-300' in diameter.) It appeared to be about a half mile away near a farm and estimated about 160' in the air. He became very afraid and began screaming at his sister to turn around, get out of there and head back home. His sister obliged when they also saw the craft and turned around the vehicle. To his dismay however, they stopped the vehicle and got out to get a better look along with the 5-10 other vehicles now lining the shoulder. As they watched, the craft hovered for what seemed like 1-2 minutes and made no sound. Suddenly in an instant it moved about 2 miles South and stopped for a few more seconds before disappearing out of sight toward the Anoka area. After the object departed, [name delted] again begged his sisters to get back into the car and go home. They did and upon entering their house, told their parents the story. After calming [witness] down and discussing the object, the eldest sister called the Ramsey Police Department to see if any one had reported the sighting. The dispatcher confirmed that other callers had also reported seeing the unusual craft in the same area during the same time frame. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright object seen by thousands and reported on all local news stationsI saw a white/silver object moving from the east to the west above the cirrus clouds. It seemed to be conducting its own light, which after dark charges to yellow then red. The sun had been down for awhile when this happened so I do not think it was reflection from the sun. In my binoculars it appered as if the object may have been exibiting rotation, but it was diffuclt to observe any details. The object would move slowly, then stop suddenly and hover. I don't think the winds aloft would make a ballon behave this way. In order for all these people to see this object which was tens of thousands of feet in altitude this object must have been very large. Just in terms of what a 747 looks like flying above cirris clouds I would say this object was 4 times larger.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Strange object in Metro skyThis is a report of the same UFO sighted in the Twin Cities area on this date- thousands of people saw this- it went right over the metro. I left work in downtown St Paul around 4:30 in the afternoon. As I walked down the street I saw several people pointing up. As this is an odd occurance in the middle of the city, I felt compelled to look up. My experience is about the same as the others who reported. It was a white or metallic reflective object, circle or somewhat teardroped in shape. I don't believe it had lights of it's own, it just looked like reflected sunlight. It did not appear to be moving and was very high. It was quite small to the naked eye. Others have mentioned, and I agree, a pea held at arms length would have covered the object. Where and when I viewed it, it was very near overhead. Perhaps a handswidth or two from directly overhead. Reports of the object spanned the Twin Cities metro- sighting of this object was also reported on 8/19 and 8/20 in Wisconsin. It was a rather obvious sight since the sky was crystal blue with no (few) clouds. I did not spend more than a few minutes watching this object. I did see reports on the news that said it had been around for hours. I'm very interested to get an explaination.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright Object in skies above Minneapolis area, August 19th, 2004. This is in response to the audio program you aired on 10-12-2004 on the object above the Minneapolis area. I was listening to the program and was also emailing one of your guests, Will. He suggested I provide a description of what I saw on August 19th, 2004. I arrived home to Chaska, MN (about 5 miles from the Chanhassen Weather Center) from a business trip to Madison, WI. the last 110 miles of the trip heads pretty much East to West heading into and through the Minneapolis area. As I was unloading my vehicle my neighbor stopped by (he is retired military) and we chatted a little bit. When I asked him what I had missed the last couple of days, he pointed in the sky directly above us and said, "see that, it's been in the spot since 9:00 am this morning. I looked up in the sky and saw a very bright object, very high in the sky. I asked hime what it was, and he said nobody knows. He said reports had been on TV and radio, but nobody knew what it was. I ran in the house and grabbed my 10X binoculars and focused in on it. It was very bright, light looking into a bright light and had a sloped rectangular shape (trapezoid?) . The brightness was unusual. The light seemed to, well, move like when you look at an asphalt road and see the heat coming off the surface. As I watched it, I noticed from the middle of the object to the bottom of it, was a grey V shape. More like a rounded V, coming from the middle sides of the object and meeting at a point in the bottom of the object. I ran back in the house and grabbed my video recorder. It has a 150X digital zoom. I tried to focus on the object, but couldn't keep it steady enough as I lay on my back in my yard. I recorded it for about a minute, then reviewed what I had recorded. All you could see was a bright light in the sky, it did not focus very well. So I went back to watching it through the binoculars. The object did move a little as I watched it. If I held my hands above my head, at a distance of about 2 feet apart, that is the distance it moved by 7:30pm. My military neighbor came back over to my house to let me know, that if it was something unknown, he was guaranteed that there would be military jets flying around. I just kept watching. Around 8:30, I asked another neighbor to look at the object through the binoculars and describe what he saw. He saw it the same way as I did. His wife looked at it and agreed. Both were as curious as I was on what the object was. By 9:00pm, the object had continued to move (another 2 feet measured by holding my hands above my head) . As my neighbor and his wife watched with me, the sun began to sink into the horizon. As the sun goes down, it does turn a reddish orange. As the sun turned that color, so did the object. Leads me to believe the object was highly reflective, and reflecting light from the sun. As the sun went down, the moon was rising from the SW. The moon rose and the object stayed in the same location. Once the sun was totally below the horizon, we could no longer see the object. Even though there was still some sunlight left in the horizon. Through the whole time I watched the object, it moved, drifted in a North to South direction. I wasn't looking straight up in the air, but the object was about 75 degrees above the horizon. I checked for reports the next day if there were sightings to the South, like Iowa or Nebraska, and nothing was reported. BUT, I did see reports on August 20th that an object was noticed in the skies around Phoenix. Some of the pictures that were submitted looked very similar to what I saw. Again, submitting this based on the comments Mr Rense made from your show. [NUFORC Note: We have amended the time above to 1700 hrs. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 3 stars moving in a triangle formation near the Minnesota-Canada border?I was camping with a friend in the northern Minnesota woods. It was very dark at night, and we were very clearly able to see the stars in the sky. While watching, we saw what appeared to be 3 stars moving in a straight line across the sky. Whatever the stars were, they appeared to be very, very high in the sky. Looking up, they appeared to be less than an inch from each other, but as high as they were, they could have been a couple of miles apart. I've seen one star move before, assuming it to be a satellite or jet plane. This is the first time I've ever seen 3 move together in what appeared to be formation. There was a single star out front and 2 other stars behind it side by side, in a triangle formation. The stars continues across the sky and we watched until we lost sight. They were travelling from southwest to northeast (into Canada) [NUFORC Note: We wonder whether the witness means a duration of 30 seconds, not 30 minutes. We will correspond with him to clarify that point. If it is 30 seconds, he may have been witness to the "triplet" of satellites that are reported to our Center quite frequently, and which are thought to be U. S. Navy satellites, which orbit in formation. PD]<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  approx 2 hrs<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> White sphere viewed with naked eye and telescope in broad daylight was most likely a high altitude balloonA white sphere was reported on local radio to be moving against the wind above the city, despite relatively brisk winds from the west. I observed a very small silver sphere to the east northeast at approximately 80 degrees from the horizon. The object was moving very very slowly to the southwest. The sky was clear and visiblilty was excellent from south Minneapolis. The object reflected sunlight and was not luminous. Observation of the object under 150x magnification with a refracting astronomical telescope revealed it to be a very high altitude balloon of significant size. It was seen to slowly deform and show tension lines which shifted as it returned to its original shape. No instrument pakage was visible. Consultations with meterologists at the University of Minnesota confirmed that every observation I made was consistent with the behavior of a very high altitude balloon (+50000 feet) , where it would not be affected by lower altitude winds, explaining its anomalous behavior in seeming to move against the prevailing wind. [NUFORC Note: One of many reports of the same object. The object has yet to be identified by law enforcement, the FAA, the National Weather Service, or local media outlets. We do not know what caused the sighting. PD]<br>

So, I was just watching the bright star shaped object. Thinking that maybe it was some sort of reflection from a high flying plane. But, it wasn't changing direction or flickering. As I stared at it trying to get my roomate to look at it. I noticed that it seemed to be going into the atmosphere. It was getting dimmer and dimmer. Until it disappeared. But, it wasn't like the "light source" was dimming. It was like it was being enveloped by the atmosphere.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  10/10/2004<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Oval<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 2 objects circled eachother for 5-8 minutes, only until they were directly overhead did we get to see the oval shape, and silver color. My daughter and I were out on our deck. She is studying cloud formation, and weather prediction, so we routinely watch the skies daily, and nightly. The sky was clear, although it was a bit hazy, as the sun did not hurt our eyes to look up. I pointed at 2 objects in the sky, and she soon located them as well. They were very high up, as I am not good with distance, I would say higher than I have ever seen a bird, but yet when I saw them I said "look at how high those birds are". She had said that they don't look like birds, as they were shining. We did not hear any engine sound, and observed that these objects were flying in circles around eachother in perfect sync, slowly. After watching for about 5-8 minutes, these 2 objects left their circular pattern, and one turned away flying straight North, which as we watched went directly above our heads, and the other followed within 30 seconds of the other, again staying in perfect sync, and distance of one another. Once these objects were directly above us, we could see a different angle of them, and noticed that their southeast corner or side was shining as the sun was shining on them. It was at first thought to be white, then we noticed it was a silver color when the sun hit them. I have seen very few birds fly that high, and this was even beyond that. We live over a direct path of airplane flight, and during this time not a single airplane was in the area. We also live in a flight area of what I believe to be Military airspace, as the Military base is not far from here. I can just about guarntee that this was an unidentified flying object. UFO's do exsist, I just can't say for sure that this is what it was at the distance we saw it at, but I also cannot find any other explanation. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

Tonight is the 7th of September and I havn't seen a UFO with this much complexity and mistique ever. From my friend's house in Lakeville along cedar we saw four green solid lights in the horizon about 3 miles away (about.) These sperical orbs rotated counter-clockwise for about 8-10mins and changed course spontanoiusly. They rotated clockwise for a short time and eventually stopped rotation and retained at square and stationary decent twords the ground. As it decended the orbs sowed their roation and sunk twords earth. The total specticale was only about fifteen minuted till we decided to hop in our cars and follow the cellestial visit - about five minutes later by the time we reached the main road the UFO sank faster then we could trace it so it so as far as we know it just dissapeared. These sperical green-lighted orbs seemed inquizative and changed its roation at an unrecognizable frequincy whilst my companions could only watch in awe at the most fucked up sight we've ever seen. By the way i have a friend who recorded the whole of this sighting on a video recording cell phone. . [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The round object above the Metrodome. It was the day of the last yankee vs. twins game at the metrodome is when my uncle cought my attention to the sky. What appeared to be right above us (between a 85-75 degree angle from where we were standing) was a white, sort of round object in the sky. Ifigured it was a weather ballon or a star, but it was just an hour before the game started in broad day light. We had brought binoculors and i look to see what it was, it was tremendously high, much higher than the plane that past by, so it was up there, then i thought it was a sattle light, but ive seen satlites in the sky, but only when it was really dark, this was large enough to see during the day. A few other people saw it also, i let them look throught the binoculors also, they didnt know what it was. But it just was in one spot for the longest time, then after a while, it was move, but very slowly. As i keeped looking into the binoculars, just wonerding what it was, it appeared to be round, it was hard to tell it it was moving in any way, but i noticed a dark spot in the middle, my uncle descibed it as a donut shaped object, and it was clearly shinny in the binoculars reflecting the suns light or something. The last i saw of it was when we went into the dome, it moved from the place from where we first saw it to a good distance if you put your pointer finger sidways torwards the sky, it moved the length of your pointer finger (mine is around 3 inches) . It was amazing to see, then my unckle told me about this site and that other people witnessed it!! So i hope my information was helpful.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> side by side reddish very fast tip to tip flying surfboards in Minnesota. My family were sitting out in the front yard around 9:00-9:30 Sept 18th. A very clear night. We were looking at stars and talking about meteors and other things in the night sky. My 6 year old daughter asked if I had ever seen any UFOs. I said with all the sky watching I&#39;ve done over the years I never had. I do think they exist. I&#39;m an aviation buff. I do a lot of amature astronomy &amp; sky watching. Meteor showers, Planets, Northern lights, Helicoptors, military aircraft. I&#39;ve seen some pretty spectacular meteors. Even one that hit the earth. I know aircraft &amp; stuff in the sky. About 2 minutes after I said I&#39;d never seen a UFO my wife said &quot;is that one?&quot; I thought she was kidding. The kids got pretty excited. I looked up to the west. What I say sent a chill up my spine. 2 dark red oval or surf board shaped objects traveling side by side. They looked like two sets of eliptical wings like a WW 2 Spitfire but no fuselage. It looked like they had some kind of internal glow or lighting. A rust red or dark orange. I thought it looked like they had some kind of geometric pattern on the bottom that mimiced the eliptical shape of craft. Maybe a light or window. My 9 year old daughter thought on of them tilted a bit and she could see the top and it had some kind of structure like a box on the top. They seemed to be in formation. Traveling very fast straight east. No sound at all. We get a of approaching air traffic for Mpls, St Paul Int airport. Pretty high up here. I know they were not any They apeared to get get kind of close and then make a sharp 30 degree turn. No slow down what so ever. They made about 3 or 4 of these quick course changes and were headed straight north. With in 3 or 4 seconds they were compleatly gone. The whole event lasted maybe 10 or 12 seconds. We all compared our notes and had seen the exact same thing. I&#39;ve seen a lot of stuff in the sky and knew what I was seeing but I&#39;ve never seen any thing like this. They manuvered like no aircraft I&#39;ver ever seen and were incredably fast. It was pretty amazing. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> One very luminated bright light just hovering in the sky, than it would slowly fade, see a haze than re-appear. We were out at our farm house on the weekend of Sept. 17-19, 2004 like we do just about every other weekend. Friday night the stars were just beautiful and bright, as usual on a clear night. Saturday night we went outside and sat on the deck looking up at the stars then we went inside to get ready for bed. My husband got up at around 3AM and went down to the kitchen and a few minutes later he was hollering at me to rush downstairs because there was something in the sky that wasn't there before, EVER. (My husband grew up on this farm so he is very familiar with all the surroundings) . I rushed downstairs into the kitchen and looked out our bay window, there in the sky, it seemed so close, a very bright luminating light. I looked down at my watch and it read exactly 3:15AM. It just stayed suspended in the sky getting brighter than it would slowly fade to where you could not see it all, but you could see a cloud or some sort of haze as to where it was, than all of sudden it would re-appear, stay very, very bright for about 15-20 min. than fade away and than you could see the haze for about 3 minutes than it would re-appear. The same process over and over again. Than off to the east my husband tells me to look left there is another one. However, this showed multi-colors and was further away but it would fade and come back like the other. Oh, also when we stood there very quietly there was this humming sound in the air like being at a power plant. Another thing was, that our dogs would not go outside, but the dogs at the nearby farms were barking just a bit different than normal. We went outside, got on the roof, walked down the driveway just watching both of them, mainly the more luminated one because it seemed so darn close. We watched the whole time until they even left. The sun started to come up all the stars slowly started to disappear as they normally do, but these two lights stayed until 7 AM. They slowing lifted into the sky, it took them approx. 1 hour to where they were completly out of our view. The whole time we just kept saying "I do not believe this, I can not believe this. " But once daylight hit and all the other stars left we knew we have seen something. We told eachother that we wouldn't tell anybody because they would think we were nuts, but we told 2 people and they said "Oh, you were probably still sleepy and didn't know what you saw. " But we knew what we saw so I had to find a website to tell to somebody. [NUFORC Note: We suspect the witnesses were observing celestial bodies. PD]<br>

Crossing the back yard I had happend to look to the southern part of the sky. That night the "Northern Lights" were visible in the sky. As I looked to the South part of the sky, I noticed 2 bright red lights flickering in the distance. They seemed to be only a few blocks away, could have been miles, but they seemed close. I pointed it out to my friend, and we watched it for a while. He said it was a plane, but I said it's moving way to slow, maybe it's a helicopter. But there were no other lights on it. Just two red lights that would blink or flash one after the other. My friend told me to stop talking about it, because he had to drive 40 miles alone back to his home.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 Minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> In october 1997 my dad and I seen 3 lights in the shape of a triangle tumbling over each other in Bemidji Minnesota. My dad and I were heading up north to go hunting. We were just outside city limits of Bemidji Minnesota traveling north on Hwy 89. We noticed a weird set of lights over a field, but since we only make it up that way about twice a year, we figured it may be a new radio tower or some form of tower that had been errected since we last passed through. As we got closer to where the "tower" should have been our conversation changed from "hunting" to what that could be in the sky. we came to a point where we were directly across from it. It was a clear night and there was no structure reaching to the sky, just 3 lights hovering above the ground. The lights were in the form of a triangle, and were all white. The reminded me of club lights, because they were tumbling. They never left the shape of a triangle, but they were tumbling, as if spinning from top to bottom. Like if you were to take a popcan and make it tumble top to bottom, from end to end. What was really cool about that is that when the lights would tumble they were as if there was a. . . that's it, a better description would be a light house. There would be a beam of light that would shine out and then it would be more soft, then beam of light. It's been a while I can't recall if they all tumbled in unisyn, or if they tumbled independent of each other. The craft itself you could not see, but you could see that there were 3 distinct points on it. It was like a triangle, or a flying pryamid. We had pulled over to the side of the road, and watched this thing for about 10 minutes. Two cars passed us by and we waved to them and pointed to the sky in the direction of the object. The cars hit their break lights as they passed, but continued on their way. After 10 minutes the object slowly started to move to the south, then in a blink of an eye it was like a distant star. It just took off. It was amazing. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD]<br>

It was a bright green round object that started falling down then swooped up and flew away at unbelievable speeds. The funny thing is that me and a friend saw the same type of thing about 8-10 years ago. . . It almost looks like a green ball of a roman candle but much clearer and moving in different dirrections.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 3 glowing dual colored lights above southern Minnesota townThis was typed about 20-30 min after the sighting. The city is located in a river valley. Slightly above the far side of the valley, I looked out my window, and say two very bright lights, one slightly, though directly above above the other. After watching, a third one appeared above and slightly to the left of the other two. Then the lowest one started to move to the left, and unfortunately it dissapeared behind some trees. I (being in the top floor of a dorm) tried to run to get a better view, but the other two "twinkled" out. At that time, it reminded me of a video I have seen that was taken from above a town it New Mexico or Colorado (I don't remember, but it was the one that many people caught on tape, and the military said that they were very bright burning flares) . I then saw where the three lights were, there appeared three red lights. As I saw these, they slowly went together and after being one red light for a short time (1-2 sec) it dissapeared.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I seen an object in the sky, thought it was a balloon, but it was too large and too high, in five minutes it barely moved. On that day I was working at a company called "Active Style" located in Minneapolis on the North East Side. Company Address is 3300 Pacific Avenue. It's near Broadway and Washington in Minneapolis, roughly 3 Miles North out of Downtown Minneapolis. I went outside to the parking lot to have a cigarette. While outside I looked up and seen something that caught my eye. At first I thought it was a balloon that may have got away from the Minnesota State Fair as that was going on in St. Paul at the time. But as I watched it for a time, it was too shiny, and too large to be a balloon that one could hold onto and hope to remain on the ground. It was way up in the sky and very glimmery. It seemed almost stationary as I was out there for 5 minutes and it barely made it about 2 inches across the sky if you were to hold up your index finger and middle finger and look to the sky. Using that as a distance to measure, if possible. I just thought it weird and went back into work.<br>

The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding. It was first spotted by my 5-year old grandson, who asked what it was. I looked up expecting to see an airplane.<br>

No more than 5 mins. had gone by when from over the house, just above the tree tops three white, brite lights forming a narrow triangle flew above my head. I could see no body attached to them. They were pointed straight ahead like car lights. If there would have been a craft attached to the lights I would have been able to see it. After all, it was so low to the ground if I would have had a rock I would have been able to hit it easily. They flew straight accross the field and over the tree line. The speed was to slow for an airplane, but fast enough where their should have been some wind sound, there wasn't even sound from an engine. I watched it most of the way accross the field. My wife and sister could not have made it out in time to see. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate. PD][NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous. PD]<br>

They were in a perfect circle around thew horizon and were quite low in the sky. My best judgment tells me they were agligned aroung a 10 to 15 mile circumfrence. I then looked through my moonroof and there was one directly above me. It appeared to follow along right above my car as I drove down the hwy. The 10 in teh circle then began to quickly dart about and then began to all quickly move outwards and then disappeared over the horizon. I looked up at the one above me and it moved straight up into the air slowly and eventually disappeared into the clouds above. The spheres themselves were perfect in shape and did not blink of flash or pulsate. Their light was solid and very bright. They stayed perfectly still while they were at rest and darted around around like no plane or helicopter I have ever seen. I rolled down my window to listen for the sound of a helicopter or plane, but there was only silence. My wife is witness to this. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Oval shaped object performs remarkable aerial feats over Hastings, MNI am a FI trainee with MUFON reporting here a sighting my sister had on the evening of January 28th of this year. My sister was driving south on Highway 61 in Hastings, MN en route to Winona when she spotted a bright, oval shaped white light southeast of her position. There were scattered clouds and the moon was fully visible. This object appeared at approximately the 3-4 o'clock position relative to the moon and my sister assumed that it was the light of an oncoming plane that she was seeing until it began to perfom some very remarkable movements. From its stationary position it rapidly decended vertically to near the horizon level and hovered. It seemed either to be wobbling or to be flashing lights, the clouds made it difficult to tell. The object then reversed direction to head directly upwards approximately 1/3 the distance it had initially decended then stopped again. After a second or two the object shot off with incredible speed to the northeast before disappearing. She had managed to reach me by cell phone during the sighting and was obviously excited and seemed certain that she had seen no ordinary aircraft. Unfortunately the object left the area before she was able to take pictures. Also of note is the fact that she saw a vehicle pulled over to the side of the road with a man and his child watching the object through binoculars. I plan to contact the local FAA to see if I can get any more information.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> stable tapered vertical light in skyLast night I got out of bed ~1:30 to fetch my girlfriend a snack (poached egg on toast; chocolate pudding) . Upon returning to our bedroom I looked out the window and saw a vertical streak of light starting just above the tree line and extending perhaps 10 - 15 degrees into the sky. The streak of light started narrow, got slightly wider and brighter in the middle and then narrowed again. It was symetric both vertically and horizontally. The light was a whitish/greening/blueish color, akin to some northern lights displays I have seen. However, it did not shimmer / wave as northern lights do. It did however slowly fade and brighten repeatedly. We both watched it for about 15 minutes before going back to sleep. The sky had a fairly uniform cloud cover. Dark spots moved accross the sky slowly, but it was not clear if these were darker clouds, or openings in the clouds exposing dark night (I suspect the latter) . Regardless, the spots passed behind the light causing no change in relative brightness. We could not judge the distance of the light. We live in Minneapolis on Seabury Ave. , which is directly on the Mississippi River. The light was about 5 degrees SE of the Prospect Park "witches hat" watertower: (http://www. pperr. org/history/thetower. html) . Checking a map to confirm the vector, I judge the light to have been somewhere along the line running through the intersection of University Ave. / Emerald St. and the centerpoint of the University of Minnesota's School of Agriculture. This light reminded my girlfriend of another odd light dispaly she saw years ago with a friend: three bars of stable verticle light each of which were truncated squarely on both the top and bottom. Go figure.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Very bright "wing span" lights too large to seem like a plane with about 5 green lights in circular pattern in back on 2 very low plaWe were approaching an intersection on state Hwy 169 and a county road next to Jordan. As we were approaching the intersection, I notice 4 very bright lights - in a pair above the treeline in the west. I didn't know what they were and my boyfriend thought they must be tower lights of somekind. I was not aware of any toweres being built there, but thought it might be a reasonable conclusion. As time went on, I thought they were moving to the east and toward us and the town. At that point, we thought they might be military planes as there is a strip in the area somewhere. But, I felt these craft were too big to be military planes. However, it was dark and so one couldn't see much but the lights. As we passed through the interestion, I continued to watch and noticed the lights on the craft. I felt they were not the usual lighting of commercial planes. I am not that familiar with military planes, but the back lights did not seem to reflect that of tail lights - but a circular set of green lights (maybe 5) . There was at least one red blinking light. We turned around to get a better look while the crafts were flying over the Hwy. We thought we would be able to get a good look because they seemed to move slowly. But, as we turned around, we were not able to see much else at a close range. They were at a low altitude like military planes, but we did not hear any loud engine sounds like I have heard in the past. I guess I didn't think that much about it because we were in a car and may not have been able to hear a noise like that. I think the biggest thing that stands out is that the "wing span" of the bright 2 lights (left and right) seemed way too wide for a plane and most of all, I have not seen green lights like that before on a plane. I have seen lots of military planes in the area and this did not seem to be like what I had seen before.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The lights followed alongside the carMy mom just introduced me to this web site yesterday and I wanted to post my experience because it was so strange. It was near the end of July in 1996, Myself (20yrs old) and 3 friends (ages 17-19) were driving from Minneapolis to Winona in the middle of the night. We wanted to be in Winona at the scenic overlook by sunrise. I had made this trip one other time before. I was driving an old 2 door Ford Escort, and my friend (who is now my husband) was in the passenger seat, and another couple were in the back seat. It was sometime between 1 am and 3 am, (not sure of exact time) it was a clear night, not very cloudy at all, we were the only car on the road and we hadn't seen another car for about 30 minutes, the other couple with us had fallen asleep in the car. All of a sudden without any warning there were 9 large, bright, flashing lights out my driverside window, now my friend on the passenger side only saw one of the lights out the windshield (in the top corner on the driverside) . The lights were in three rows of three, and the rows were staggered (will email drawing) The best way to describe the lights is like a set of stadium lights, like at a baseball field, when they turn on you can here the flash as the electricity runs to the bulbs. Thats how all 9 lights looked, and they all flashed at the same time, but not in a pattern just random. The lights lit up the other lane on the highway and the ditch. There was nothing but open field in this area, and the lights were very bright I was yelling at my friend "What is that, Do you see that" and he just staired out the windshield and was absolutely quite through this, and the two people sleeping in the back seat didn't wake up as I was yelling at my friend to answer me. Now, i'm not saying there was something wrong with him he was just shocked at what we were seeing and didn't know how to respond to me. I was driving about 60 mph when these lights appeared, and they kept pace with the car for at least 30-40 seconds, they remained out my driverside window, flashing, they didn't change color but I would say they had some color. I don't know if the lights had color or if it was my eyes messing with me, it was like stairing at the sun, you get some spects of color in your view when you look away. They were very bright white just like stadium lights. I would say the bottom row of lights were 10 feet or so above the ground, just on the other side of the ditch. I had to look up out of the window to see the top row. I asked my friend if I should stop the car, I got no response, I kept yelling what the ---- is that, I was really freaked out. I deceided to keep driving, still a speed of about 60-65 mph, and then the lights drifted just behind my window, and I looked back and they were just out the little side window in the rear for about 2-3 seconds, and then they disapeared just like that. No sound, no trails of light, nothing. It was like someone just flipped off the light switch. Then my friend looked at me and said "that was crazy" and then my other two friends woke up and we told them what happened and they didn't believe us of course. I don't know what it was that I saw, all I know is the lights were not there before, I didn't see the road lit up or anything and then WAM there they are, and the fact that they stayed with the car while I was driving! Stationary lights that are on a pole or something don't keep up with a car going 60, and they lit up the road so much I would have seen it on approach. Then to just disapear, it was crazy. The other weird thing was that my two friends in the back could sleep through me yelling. I just don't get it. We told everyone we knew about it when we got back and only a few believed us. Now, we were all older teens at the time but credible people, we weren't drinking or anything the night this happened. I tried for a long time to find a reasonable explination, but I can't. I could say that the lights themselves could have been some kind of stadium lights because they looked just like that, but I can't explain why they would have been in the middle of no where and how they would have turned on all of a sudden and then traveled alongside the car. And then GONE just like that. If someone has a suggestion of what it might have been please share it with me, I am open to hear anything that might explain it. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 3/5/05 Snowmobiling 9:30 AM on northern Mn. lake, several lights appeared above trees, blinking off and on, not moving, 45 min. Two males snowmobiling out on a northern Minnesota lake on March 5th around 9:30 AM when they spotted lights above the trees; above some cabins. Four lights in a row, 3 different lights blinking on &amp; off, and different 2 lights blinking. Lake is 1 and 1/2 miles long, 3/4 mile wide. The craft was down on one end of lake and large enough to block a television tower light which has never been out in 40 years. They went and got two more friends, one male and one female. Craft was still there when they snowmobiled back onto the lake. One of the males said that he could see that there was metal or a shape reflected as the lights blinked off and on. It stayed in the same position and did not move. They did comment that an airplane had flown over during the time they observed it. They left before the craft left because they were worried about the power on there machines going out. It was clear to all that these were lights not reflections. They have lived on this lake for many years and commented that they have never seen anything like this before.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  2/28/2005<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Sphere<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 1970&#39;s sighting of small UFO that hovered, maneuvered, split into two objects, then rejoined and flew off. This happened in 1974 or &#39;75, when I was about 15 years old. It occured on a winter weekend, in January, in my home town of Pipestone, Minnesota; a small (5000 pop.) rural town in the southwestern part of the state. I was home alone as my parents were away for the weekend. Two school friends, brothers, who lived across the street had a couple of snowmobiles, and we spent the latter part of the afternoon riding their sleds in an undeveloped area on the south edge of town, a few blocks from where we lived. Late afternoon, almost dusk, we went back home. I wandered out into the street between our houses while I was waiting for them to put their sleds away in their garage. I was just sort of looking around, and noticed a lighted object in the sky approaching from the southwest, roughly from the direction of the field in which we had been snowmobiling. It appeared to be a single object with two lights, one red and one white. I believe one of the lights was blinking, but I can&#39;t remember now which color it was. I assumed at this point that it was a small private plane, as the town had a small municipal airport and it wasn&#39;t unusual to see small single-prop planes in the area. The object continued to approach until it was directly overhead, then turned east flying directly over the street I was standing on. It moved a short distance straight east, maybe a block or two, then stopped and hovered. The object appeared to me only as two glowing globes of light, red and white, stuck together like two beads or marbles that are touching (they did appear to have dimension, i. e. the glowing lights were definitely spherical, not just point sources of light) . I saw no other structure, so I don&#39;t have a good reference for determining the size of the object - however I should note that although it was right about dusk, there was still some daylight, and had it been a small plane or helicopter I would surely have seen the structure (there were no helicopters in town anyway) . As to height, based on how it later flew away (below) , it seems the height was modest as the object disappeared below a nearby tree line before travelling very far, so I would guess it was roughly a few hundred feet - no more than 1000 - off the ground. If this is true, then the object was not very large - perhaps the size of a car or truck. Anyway, after hovering for perhaps 10 - 20 seconds, the object moved directly back along the way it had come, straight back west over the street until it was directly overhead, and then it stopped &amp; hovered again. It did not turn or maneuver like an airplane would have to, it had simply moved straight backward along its original line of flight after hovering. At this point I was almost in shock at what I was seeing, and just stood there staring at it. If one of the lights had been blinking earlier as it approached, neither one was now - both lights were glowing steadily. It hovered directly overhead for another 10-20 seconds, then the two lights separated and moved apart. One light moved north a short distance, the other moved south a short distance, and it seemed that there was a thin glowing filament connecting the two. The filament seemed to gradually fade away until I could no longer see anything connecting the lights. (I suppose the filament could have been an afterimage in my eyes created by the movement of the lights, but it didn&#39;t seem to me that the lights were so bright as to have had that effect - but maybe. . . The lights were not bright like a spotlight, more of a strong but soft glow.) The apparent separation between them was probably not much more than the apparent distance between my hands if I hold my arms straight up overhead. The lights stopped &amp; hovered in this position, separated from each other, for another 10-20 second interval, then moved back together and &quot;rejoined&quot;. After another short interval just hanging there hovering straight above me, the recombined object moved slowly away to the southeast. At no time during all of this did the object make any noise at all - it was totally silent. Once it started moving away I kind of &quot;snapped out&quot; of the almost-trance I had been in while watching it, realized that someone else should see this too, and yelled for my friends to come see. (I don&#39;t mean to imply that the object had directly affected me by using the word &quot;trance&quot;, but while watching it I was completely focused-in on what I was seeing &amp; oblivious to all else, could hardly believe what I was seeing, and it did not occur to me to call to my friends until it started moving away.) One of my friends came to see what the fuss was about, but by the time he got there the object was some distance away and all he saw was a moving light in the sky, which he took to be a small plane. The object continued to move away until it drifted below the tops of the trees on the next city block in the line of sight, and we lost sight of it - I would guess it might have been a half mile away at that point. As far as I know, no one else in town reported anything strange that day. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  2/24/2005<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Disk<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> In October 1967, 2 Disks sited heading north over Minneapolis MN. I am estimating the date and time based on where we lived at the time, and the fact that I was wearing a jacket. I was 10 years old at the time. We lived in the 9xx unit on Olson Highway, in Minneapolis MN. My mother had sent me out to find my younger brother because it was getting dark. I remember that I had a jacket on, it was cool (and dry) but not cold, late September or early October. I was gone about 1/2 hour, and by the time I returned it was almost dark, and there was no one else in our front yard area. I had just entered edge of our front lawn, and was about 30 feet from the front door of our unit/apartment. As I entered the front lawn, I do no know why, but for some reason I had weird feeling, that something was above me. As I looked up, traveling due north at a slow rate of speed, I saw two round disks. They were left of me at about 10-15 degrees from vertical and in front of me by about the same amount. I could therefore not have seen the objects out of the corner of my eye. One distinguishing characteristic was that their bottoms, which is all I saw, appeared to be on fire. This did not appear to be a form of propulsion. It was almost exactly like the appearance of the bottoms of the saucers in the movie Independence Day. However, they were much higher, with the appearance of about the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. They did not seem very high, possibly about a mile high. I'll just add that the fiery bottoms are what one might expect as a result of friction with the atmosphere if such an object entered the atmosphere at a high rate of speed. I immediately looked towards my front door and tried to yell to get the attention of someone inside, but I could not yell. I looked back up and the disks were moving at the same speed. I then ran into our apartment and tried to speak, but still could not speak, and after about 5 seconds, I headed out the back door with the family behind me. However, the two disks were no longer overhead. I still could not speak, and we went back inside our apartment. It was about another 10 seconds after I was inside before I was able to speak. I "blurted" out, "I saw a flying saucer". I was unable to speak for a total of about 2 minutes, and the only way to describe it is, it was as if my brain had a mind of its own. In my mind/brain, it was like someone had pressed a 'fast rewind' button. When I tried to speak, I could not interrupt what was going on in my brain. I had to close my eyes and concentrate real hard, and was eventually able to regain control and speak. I never saw anything like it before or since the above event. I also never (before or since) , had a problem where I was unable to speak like that. At the time, I was above average in intelligence, especially in math. Before the above event, as opposed to being someone who was fascinated with outer space, I don't recall having any interest in it at all, which changed after the above event. I have told a few friends over the years, but it is not something you can prove, so why bother. However, my mother did call the airport, who indicated they had received no other reports.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Sighting of triangle object and caveman (yeah, I know--sounds like I am out of my mind, but there were two of us) I was at the website and read the article about submitting sights that have happened in the past, well--I have a doozey!! I was 17 and it was the summer of 1975 in Minneapolis Minnesota. My 'friend-boy' (he was 22) was walking me back to my apartment where I lived with my family. We stopped to talk and were standing in the Phyllis Wheatley elementary school field that separated the school from my apartment building by about an acre. The street was about a half a block away to my right and his left, facing the apartment building. Across from the apartment building was another apartment complex. It was about a half an hour before sunset on a very clear evening. Around the perimeter of the field, there were a lot of tall trees. We were engrossed in a very good conversation when I notice to my left, something coming through the tops of the trees. It didn't make a sound but it was as big as a very large house. It was black and shaped like a very narrow triangle. It has lights on each point and a big 'spotlight' typed light in the middle. It whoosed over the very tops of the trees, so close that we both ducked, thinking it was going to hit us. I asked him if he saw what I had just seen and we both definately agreed that what we saw was shaped like nothing we had ever seen before. Now, here is where it gets very, VERY strange. Not more that one minute later, as we were engrossed in conversation about the object we had just saw, I noticed movement, this time over my right shoulder. Coming out of the bushes next to one of the apartment buildings across the street was a caveman!! I stopped in mid sentence and my friend noticed and followed my eyes. He then asked me if I saw what he was seeing. I said that yes, I see a caveman!! We both watched as the caveman parted the bushes holding what looked like a large tree branch in his left hand. He was not very tall and had on what looked like brown fur around his mid-section. The color of his skin was light beige. He didn't make a sound but stared at us as we stared at him. What broke the concentration was when I screamed. The caveman then started coming towards us--but he moved like he was under water or mechanical. I could NOT move from where I was standing because I could NOT stop staring at this very strange sight! Finally my friend grabbed my hand and said to me to stop staring and start running! I had on a pair of yellow Japanese shoes that I had to kick off because my friend was pulling me so fast. I turned to look behind us and the caveman was so close that I could see that his bared mouth bore yellow teeth. When he ran, it was in that mechanical, under water way--like he could not control his movements--but that didn't stop him from moving so fast! He looked like he was caught in the beams of a strobe light. As we reached the steps of my building, I looked back again but only saw his hand as it was ready to grab me just under my shoulder. Thank goodness the building's main entrance door was always unlocked!! We got in the building and my apartment door was unlocked as well (because my siblings were home) . I locked the apartment door behind us and we both ran to the front window to see if we could see him anywhere but all we saw were my parents who were just pulling up. We both looked at each other in puzzlement, then ran right back to the door--he snatched it open only to find an empty entryway. The caveman was gone just that quick! We both ran out to help my parents with the groceries--both talking a mile a minute about our experience. When we got back inside, my mom asked us what the thing in the sky looked like. We described it to her and my dad. My mom suddenly had to sit down and they both just stared at each other. My Mom then told us that that was the same object they saw, along with about 50 others, just the week before. They had been stopped at a light at a very busy intersection and she said everyone was jumping out of their cars pointing at it. She said they all got an excellent look at it because it was moving slowly across the sky. I remember her showing us the newspaper clipping about it.

<b>DURATION:</b>  10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Silent boomerang object seen in sky over Eagn MNObject appeared from the southeast travelling northwest. Because of surrounding trees, about 120 degrees of shy was visible overhead. It was a cloudless night. The object was boomerang shaped or possibly trianglular. A series of dull lights, remimded me of amber bicycle reflectors, between five to seven of them, were arranged in a chevron pattern along the leading edge. I am unsure if the object was boomerang shaped or triangular since the lights were an a chevron pattern and the training edge of the object was not clearly visible. The motion of the object caught my attention since it was balck but a bit more matte and light than the backgound sky, like a silhoutte. I initially thought from the size that I was seeing the silhouette of an eagle flying glow overhead when I first caught sight of the object from the corner of my vision, but as soon as I turned my attention to the object, I saw the lights and details. It clearly occluded the stars in the sky. I cannot estimate the object, but it was about the same size as a bald eagle flying about 50 feet overhead. The object made no sound. It traversed the arc of the sky visible to me in about 8 seconds (about 120 degrees) . The speed and direction of the object appeared constant during the time I observed it. The lights did not flash or otherwise change shape, posiiton of color. As I lost sight of it in the trees, I moved to a clear area which toook about 5 seconds. I was unable to locate the object in the sky again.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> July 1947 around 5 pm I saw a gray disc-like object in the sky which newscaster Cedric Adams mentioned laterI'm not at all certain of the date. It could have been July - September 1948. I would have been 24 or 25. We lived at [deleted-- XXX] 6th Street, S. E. A telephone company building was to my right on the corner. These buildings no longer exist. Hubert Humphrey and his family lived down the block on the street running to my right. I was standing at the top of a flight of outdoor stairs which descended to the back yard, waiting for my husband to come home from work. The object was not far above the height of the trees but far away, almost still. It was gray, bulging smoothly at top and bottom. It hung there long enough for me to realize it wasn't a plane or dirigible or balloon. Then it disappeared. I may have been momentarily distracted by my baby. Later that evening we listened to Cedric Adams, a Minneapolis news commentator, who mentioned that he had had calls about a flying object. [NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The red and green lights were in a triangular configuration and just hovered above the airport with no soundIn approximately May of 1977 a friend of mine and I were at the Crystal Airport (MIC) , Minneaplis, MN, at approximately 2300 hours local time. We had both recently received our pilot's licenses and were avid flyers. My friend's father owned a flying school at the airport. We had just returned from an evening of night flying and had put the airplane in the hangar. The night sky was very clear with stars showing brightly. At this time of night air traffic in the Minneapolis area was very light. During this event there were no aircraft operations at the MIC airport. My friend and I were talking outside at the airport and noticed some colored lights hovering in a stationary position directly above the MIC airport. At first we thought these lights may be a helicopter, balloon, or some other type of stationary craft. As my friend was interested in star gazing and had his telescope at the airport building, we got the telescope out to look at these lights. We both observed, over a period of at least 10 minutes, three lights, in a tringular configuration, consisting of green and red lights, each of these being in a triangular shape, hovering directly over the airport, altitude unknown. We believed the lights to be maybe about 10, 000 feet MSL because it took the power of the telescope to clearly see them. The three lights appeared to "wobble" in the triangular configuration and they did not move or change altitude. We were both very surprised that the lights, which we believed were attached to some type of solid, trianglar object, ommited no sound whatsoever. Other than the lights, we could not actually see any type of object to which they could have been attached as it was dark night at this time. The MIC control tower was closed at that time, so we could not contact them for confirmation of what this object may have been. After about 10-15 minutes of observation the lights just disappeared.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Very bright white light speeding down HWY94 low in the sky, outside minneapolis on 3/19/05 10:45 pmWe were driving west on hwy 94, lots of traffic for a saturday night. We were coming home from a family birthday party and our kids were in the car behind us. Out of nowhere, coming from behind us and swooping over us was this incredibly bright white light moving silently past us. It was so white that I remember thinking that the on-coming head lights looked like a dull yellow. I have seen what looked like falling stars in the past, but this wasn't like that. It came right over us and everyone else on the freeway at that time. There was no noise. We called our kids in the car behind us right away and they too were in total amazement. It flew or glided horizontally unbelievably fast and when it reached the horizon you could see colors below it.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> We have 6 minutes 23secs of video tape on what my husband and I encountered. . . . . It was july 27th , around 2:00 AM when my husband and I decided to go for a drive to a trail near our home. It was a warm and beautiful night and the sky was clear and bright with stars . We got out of the van and started walking the trail hand in hand, it was about 5 mins into the walk i wanted to return to the van, My husband jokingly asked " why are you scared a bear's gonna get us?" I said "No, but , I really want to go to the van now okay"{for some reason i was feeling uneasy, and not knowing why untill what was to come}We headed back to the van, sat inside and lite a cigerette, just sitting and visting and looking at the stars, i bent down looking for my cell phone to check the time when my husband said " oh my god what is that!" I said, oh knock it off your not funny. "Thinking that he was tring to scare me. But why I looked up to the direction he was looking I felt my heart racing and i started shaking. In front of our van, was this big light, it seamed to be bright white with color coming from the top and bottom the color seamed to be changing red, blue , then yellow. the shape is hard to decribe but i'll do my best. . it looked like a ball with the top and bottom cut off and the top and bottom had a jagged appearence that is where the color was coming from this thig was a huge it seemed to be coming closer i got scared telling my husband, "I want to go now" he agreed i nervously turned our van around and speed out of the trails parking lot . my husband then said oh my god it's following us. I looked up and it was following us but it seemed to be a little ahead of us . Now when we first saw this thing it was facing northeast when we got home it stopped above our home and was facing south west. We ran into our home , then after about 10 seconds we went out side and it was still there we starred at it and talking to each other about what the heck is it . Then it dawned on me i said "honey our video camera". We taped it, we have it on tape 6 mins and 23 secs. long it changes shapes, turns transparent, and it turns into a full clear triangle before it disappears. and our camera kept dying in the minute of taping i had to go in and charge the battery a few times we that that was odd as well on the sighting . the next morning we woke up with unexplained cuts and bruises on our face and feet. We have our tape in a safe place no copies where ever made, We are just waiting for the right oppertunity to share it with the world. signed , still amazed.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I observed a bright orange triangle that made no noise and moved slowly into the North disappearing. A bright orange triangular object appeared from the East at treetop level. It slowly moved Westerly in a wavy fashion. It then proceeded to move North slowly and faded off into the distance. The object made no sound. The night was clear and still. I observed this from my backyard on my deck and the neighborhood was quite dark. On the Northern horizon there was a faint display of the Northern Lights in the distance. The object seemed to disappear about the point where the Northern Lights faded. The object would fit in the full moon, if the full moon was about half its normal size. [NUFORC Note: We express our gratitude to the Fergus Falls Daily Journal, and its award-winning journalist, Mr. Brandon Stahl, for publishing their article about this reported event. Please see other report from second witness in Fergus Falls. The source of this report indicated that the object was in the northern sky, from his vantage point.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I thought it was a star until I watched it slowly move across the sky appearing to start and stop as it went along. I let my dogs out around 11:15 [ AM ] and was just looking in the sky from my driveway when i saw a point of light in the southeast that was traveling towards the northeast. what struck me as odd was that it would appear to start and stop as it made it's way across the sky. When it got to the northeast another point of light appeared to travel straight up and meet it. It seemed like 10-15 seconds passed, then the one i originally saw went straight up as the other one went straight down. I lost the second one in the trees, but the first one went up a short ways and then appeared to just stop again. At that point i went in to get my husband who was watching tv and he came out and we both looked at where it was, but it was gone, nothing else was moving. Neither objects had any flashing lights, they were so far away just points of light. I could hear highway sounds, so maybe it had a sound but i couldn't distinguish one. [NUFORC Note: We suspect that the witness may have been observing satellites. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Woman reports witnessing a "bright red sphere" in the southern sky, viewed from her home. Telephoned Report: A woman called from Fergus Falls, MN, to report that she had witnessed the same object that had been reported in a May 21, 2005, article by the Fergus Falls Daily Record. The woman reported that at 02:53 hrs. (local) on Friday morning, May 20, 2005, she had witnessed from here home in Fergus Falls a "bright red sphere" in the southern sky. She reported that the light was "solid, not blinking, " and that it was moving to the west, i. e. from her left to right. She also stated that she had taken a photograph of the object, and volunteered that her location was "just three blocks from the other witness. " [NUFORC Note: The woman who submitted this report is known to the original witness, who reported having seen at 03:00 hrs. a triangular object, imbedded in orange light, and covered with tiny, distinct orange lights on its surface. Given that the female witness has not submitted a written report, and given that neither NUFORC, nor any of the residents in Fergus Falls, has seen her alleged photograph, we have to consider whether this report may be a hoax, submitted by a "wannabe" witness, responding to the newspaper article. We are saddened by this situation, given the convincing nature of the report from the first witness, but we feel duty-bound to share this fact with those who may read all the reports about the alleged event over Fergus Falls.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Blue glowing sphere descends to Earth between ground witnesses and jet pilots in Twin Cities, Minnesota. I'm a licensed private pilot. I was in my kitchen in West St. Paul looking out the window west northwest towards downtown Minneapolis 11 miles away from me. I saw a bright light over Minneapolis. I knew it was the landing light of a large jet on a downwind leg to land at Minneapolis International Airport. My 10 year old son was the only one home with me at the time. He was in the living room watching t. v. The jet was coming directly toward me and also decending, so it looked from my perspective like a stationary light in the sky that was just growing larger and larger. So I thought it would be fun to play a joke on my son, so I said come quick, there's a U. F. O!" He came running. We looked out the window at the landing light on the jet growing larger and larger. My son was in awe! We watched it for about 2 minutes and then as it became near enough to us, we could finally see the red and green wingtip navigation lights and a blinking white strobe light on it's belly. I said to my son "oh boy, I guess it was just a jet plane after all!" (At this point, I would say that the jet was about 2 miles from us, maybe a bit farther) . No sooner had I finished saying that, both he and I saw a large spherical ball, I would guess about 50 feet in diameter, descend to Earth from an altitude much higher than the jet was flying. We were right at the window, and the object entered our fields of vision from the top of the window opening, so it must have come from an extremely high altitude. I have seen many meteors, and this was no meteor. When it first appeared, it was falling in a slight arcing travel path from northeast to southwest, but very quickly changed into a strightline fall directly down all the way to Earth and disappeared behind the treeline. We didn't see it rise up again. I think it struck the Earth. I know it wasn't a meteor because it fell much more slowly than a meteor would, like it's speed of descent was being controlled (imagine a meteor with a large drag chute, if you will.) The object was glowing in a very faint, light blue aura that reminded me of what a blue topaz gemstone looks like. It was EXTREMELY beautiful! Me and my son looked at each other in amazement and we both said "what was that?!" at the same time! I say there were 4 witnesses to this sighting because the object came down in it's path of travel directly between me and my son and the two pilots of the jet. I know that there is NO WAY that those 2 pilots could have missed seeing it! I watched the T. V. news and the newspapers for a few days afterwards hoping that there were many more witnesses and that there was a story to be told, but I never heard a word about it. I'm not exactly sure of the date being March 10th, but I am sure it was in early March at about 6 AM I'm reporting it now, because as the weeks have gone passed, I am at an absolute loss to explain what I saw and I'll just bust if I don't tell somebody! If this object indeed came to a rest on Earth, I would estimate it's current location would be along a line between the north end of the city of West St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis about 2, maybe 3 miles from West St. Paul toward Minneapolis. I would guess it hit the ground near Cherokee Park in St. Paul, or perhaps in the Mississippi River between the Ford Dam and downtown St. Paul. I will never forget it's slow fall and beautiful faint light blue glow! Like an angel's halo!!![ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS]Hi! The best I could do to reconstruct the date was to look at our calender back in March for any unusual events. My wife gets home from work at 5:30 AM , so she would have been home, but she wasn't. The only thing the calender shows is that on Mar. 8th, she was gone in the evening to our church for bible a study, so I believe now that the sighting was on Mar. 8th, 2005, not Mar 10th. I didn't contact any investigators or authorities because this sphere was just so unusual that it just couldn't have been anything easily explainable (from Earth!) . I figured if I watched the news carefully, the two jet pilots or the FAA controllers at Mpls. International would be speaking about it, or the fact that this thing came down near sunset but still very much in broad daylight in the center of a major metropolitan area would mean there were probably many thousands of witnesses, but nothing in the news ever appeared. If I ever see anything like that again, I will certainly take careful notes, now that I have somebody like you guys that I can tell about it. I'm 48 yrs. old, and I've never seen anything like that in my life! I kinda hope I don't see one ever again! Kinda scary in a way, not knowing what you just saw, you know?[END ADDENDUM][NUFORC Note: We have changed the date above to March 08, 2005. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Morphing TriangleIt was abeautiful autumn day. I was sitting on a second story balcony of my then apartment which I shared with my then girlfriend. The balcony faces west. Approximately at sunset or thereabouts. The Sun was large, nearing but still above the horizon. Brilliant deep yellow and Orange in color. Suddenly the Sun appeared to change in shape from it's known 'round' to a Triangular shape. At the same time the color changed from the yellow/orange to a silvery metallic color. The Triangle appeared and disappeared a number of times. This was if you were looking directly at a perfect triangle. It did not rotate, bank or otherwise indicate any motion laterally, vertically or otherwise. Just a perfect triangle where the sun had been. When it reappeared however the triangle was inverted, with the tip, or point at the bottom. This disappearance and reappearance happened approximately 2 or 3 times. Then as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone and the Sun was back as though nothing had happened. There was no disturbance or change to the emitted light in the sky. There was no sound associated with this occurance. The distance to the observed object 'Triangle' is impossible to say due to it's apparent morphing with the Sun. I had called for my girlfriend to hurry and come see what I was seeing but she wasn't interested and so did not witness. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Man witnesses peculiar, orange-colored, triangular object against the night sky. Telephoned Report: A man called to report having witnessed a very peculiar, triangular-shaped craft, as it flew along a nearby river. The witness reported that he awoke from sleep, and looked out the north-facing window of his residence at approximately 0250 hrs. . After a short period of time, he witnessed a very peculiar, triangular-shaped object, that was covered with many tiny orange lights. The net effect of the lights was to give the object an overall, distinctly orange color. He added that the object appeared to be an equilateral triangle, and its apparent size, from his vantage point, he thought would have been slightly smaller than the apparent size of a full Moon in the night sky. The object slowly moved out of his sight to the east, after he had witnessed it for an estimated two minutes. [NUFORC Note: We were first apprised of this incident by Mr. Brandon Stahl, a journalist for the Daily Journal Newspaper in Fergus Falls, MN.

After watching the sunset, we noticed a strange phenomena in the afterglow light. There were 4 sets of light/lines across the sky each at an angle of 50 degress or so. At first we thought they might be jet contrails, but they were very defined, without any broken up pattern in the line like contrails leave. Two of us watched the lights and called the other 2 in our group to observe. They moved at the angle they were pointed in, slightly downward and then one moved out of sight. Another appeared to move out of sight and then it started going upward in the same angle and another one above it moved downward, maintaining the same amount of space from each other as they traveled in opposite directions. One line had a bright light off the end of it that appeared briefly. Finally after about 20 or so minutes the light lines disappeared.<br>

Maybe 100 feet or so above the tower. It had 3 star-like, lights! 1 on each point of the triangle. I was stunned! I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes! Couldn&#39;t believe this was happening to me! The freakiest feeling I&#39;ve ever encountered. Ever! Then, as I saw a small plane approaching directly from the northwest, the Triangle began to depart. As if it knew it was visible. The low-end hum began to speed up as the Triangle slowly made it&#39;s way off. It seemed to just float away in the strangest manner! This thing was like 3 city blocks long! Never ever seen anything that big move that slow with that much power! As it sped up, a circular, multicolored light in the center of the triangle began to light up &amp; spin. Then, it vanished.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  26 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangular plane like object seen close to ground with little noise, moved very little over the course of 26 seconds then was gone. I was pulling off of the highway and thought I was seeing mars in the distance. I was driving towards it in my car and noticed it was too close to be mars because it was growing in size with regards to my approach. I pulled towards it and noticed some blinking lights. . . but it was not moving or not moving much. I pulled into the CompUSA parking lot on Hopkins Crossroad and 394 and observed it some more. . . it seemed to be about 200 feet away. At first I thought it was a plane, but it wasn't moving quickly enough. It was very close. I considered a helicopter, but it didn't seem to be the right shape or light configuration. I parked my car, grabbed my camera, and stepped out into the parking lot. As I grabbed my camera, it started to move. Outside of the car I could hear a slight whirring sound like the sound of a jet, but it was way too quiet to be that close to me. In addition, the sound was not shifting like a Doppler effect would cause. It was constant. I had been taking photos of the moon (or trying to) , so my camera was set to accommodate the brightness of the moon against the night sky. I was not thinking straight enough to realize this until after around five photos taken. . . probably over the course of 10 seconds. Still too shocked to think straight, it traveled past me and I stopped taking pictures to get a better look at it with my eyes. It definitely had lights and looked like a very triangular plane of some sort. It looked closest to the F117 shape if it was a plane. It had two white lights and a flashing red light in the middle. . . again, like a plane might have. But it was much closer than a plane could have been, was traveling too slowly, and wasn't loud enough. I changed the settings on my camera and, by that time, the object had passed by me (this is around 15-20 seconds since I stepped out of my car) . I started taking some pictures that actually turned out. The lights kept the same spacing, more or less, despite the angle from which I was viewing it. It was black and when the red light flashed, I could see a slight outline of the thing. The two photos that came out best show it against a building. It moved across only 15% of the viewing area between the two photos and my digital camera stamped the times five seconds apart. That seems far too slow to be a plane. The object seemed to be pulling over the highway when I noticed another set of lights to my left. I watched those for a moment. . . but I realized that those were just a normal plane. I turned back to watch the original object but it was nowhere to be seen. I got in my car and tried to follow approximately where it seemed to be headed but I didn't see it again. I have those photos and they mostly show the two white lights. I drove to a hill where I saw a UFO zipping around in the distance around six years ago and I saw what might have been it quite a bit further out. It was moving slowly, again, and it was moving in the opposite direction. Over the course of two minutes it made its way across the whole horizon. It might have been a standard plane. . . the camera was having a hard time snapping photos that showed any detail. The only thing odd about it was the trajectory. . . it was moving in an arc instead of a straight line. But it never came much closer.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  20 Min.<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The 3 objects appeared above the horizon at sunset One headed West and two headed North. Very bright!It was 8:oo AM , there are only two of us on the night shift and we take a break at this time. We were standing out in front of the building which faces west, the sun had gone down below the horizon. At this time we noticed a very bright light above the hill about two miles away, appx. altitude was 2000 ft. . My first thought was "Venus", but the object seemed to be moving away from us and to the North. My comment was "It must be the atmosphere making it seem to move". As we watched, another light appeared about 1000 ft. above the first. The second light started moving to the North as the first continued Northwest. The one moving North was slowly pulsating from very bright to the point that it was not visible. We watched both qbjects for about ten minutes until the one headed North finally dimmed and was gone. Suddenly another bright light appeared approximately where the second one had been sighted. By this time, the first object had continued Northwest until it was no longer visible. The third object followed the same path as the second Northbound object. It also slowly pulsated at the same rate and brightness. As it moved to the North it also dimmed from view.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Disk moved across sky, and slowed floating down toward ground. I (age 44 M) was riding as a passenger in vehicle heading South on U. S. 94 about 5 miles North of Monticello, Minnesota on Saturday, July 30, 2005 about 12:15 AM My Brother (age 42) was driving. He noticed what at first appeared to be a large meteror passing by up and in front of the vehicle moving from the South to the North. He said that it had a tail - I did not notice a tail. The object appeared to slow down and turn into a bright white disk. It was "floating" down - heading toward the ground, going much too slowly to be a meteror. It was heading down in a straight line, and then disappeared over a hill at least 2 miles away. We both commented that we had never seen anything like that before. My Brother is college educated in the real estate business - I have a doctorate degree. [NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to be exceptionally rational and objective in his description of the event.

It would make quick little jerks just about in any direction and zig-zag like movements also. It changed into different colors very rapidly. It was almost like it was a color strobe light in the sky. It lasted for about an hour. I went back out side around 1 am and it was gone.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Flashing Ring floats S-SW from Minneapolis view area 45 minutesFrom Maple Grove MN looking south recognized an odd flickering of light for what I would expect to be a star or planet. Watched for 10 minutes noticing that the object moved ver slow across the sky. Used aircraft leaving MSP Airport as reference to object as they were moving many miles closer to my location. Could discern what apeared to be red and green blinking lights. Retrieved binoculars and telescope. Binoculars confirmed the twinkling light, but unable to see much else other than the slow movement S to SW. 21:45 set up telescope and targeted object. Clearly saw what appeared to be a planar ring shape glowing modest white/yellow light, with bright white lights flashing around the diameter in an orderly counter-clockwise direction. Ring did not appear completely rigid, but could have been as it may have been "wobbling" or deforming. Object appeared to remain planar, and did not expand or contract. Looked much like what you would see under a microscope looking at a small bacteria or sea animal. Green and Red lights would periodically flash from what I can best describe as directly perpendicular to the ring plane. Looked like a donut with an imaginary center post kind of like a spinning top. As the object moved to the SW, it fell below the house and tree lines and I gave up watching about 22:15.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Red and Whie flashing light over Twin CitiesI saw what appeared to be a UFO from my home in Eagan last night. It was too far away to make out any shape, but after looking at my star software, I ruled out any planet, star or other celestial object. It had caught my attention because it was so bright, like a bright Mars in the sky, or a tad brighter and larger. But it was white, like a star and it was flashing red. I needed to know what it was, but after viewing my sky astronomy software and finding nothing even closely matching, I realized it must be something else. The object could be seen looking into the western sky at about 11:30pm, and finally going out of vision (very small spec by this time but the flashing red still visable) at about 2:00am, traveling very slowly in a west-ward direction. I grabbed my camcorder to see if I could zoom in any closer on this object. While I did record the flashing red, you can't make out anything else. Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>

The object did not necessarily return to its original position or appear to be moving away.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> We saw an object in the sky that didn&#39;t appear to be moving. It shot out lights in all directions from it&#39;s center. The lights would switch from green to red. I thought it was an advertising gimmick of some sort. I wanted to drive over to where the light was comming from to see what was causing it. The others who saw it, (my wife &amp; 2 kids, and 2 of their cousins, decided to go inside instead. I stood outside watching it and the lights were red and they slowly faded away twards the objects center. Then the object slowly flew off to the South. It blinked red and green as it flew. At that time I noticed another object further East and North that seemed to be the same kind of craft. It was blinking red and green also, but did not shoot lights out from it&#39;s center. I got my wife to come out and see the 2nd similar object. I wouldn&#39;t have thought anything of them had the first one not shot out those lights. Here&#39;s the strange part. We were having a weenie roast outside, and to impress the kids I shot off 4 fireworks. We were heading inside right after the last firework when we first noticed the first object. I called the Washington County Sheriffs office an hour later to see if anyone else had reprted seeing these objects and was told no. When I described the shooting lights The lady on the phone asked me if I was sure they were not fireworks. The sighting ended about 10 minutes after I first noticed them as they flew out of sight to the South. [NUFORC Note: Possible twinkling stars, we suspect. Just a guess. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Cylinder<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  2-3 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It was a the size and shape of a soup can, it glowed candy-apple red, and traveled from zero to fast instantly and silently. In late summer of 1982, I (age 18) and 4 friends ranging in age from 12 - 17 were out on a warm and dark night driving for something to do. In our search for adventure, we cruised through a grave yard on the edge of the city limits and near the local airport. I was the driver, and as we explored the maze of graveyard lanes, my friends began seeing glowing white and red lights. One of the girls in the back seat was nearly hysterical in directing me which way to drive so as to avoid the lights they were seeing. I believed their sightings to be the late-night imaginations of ditsy teen-agers. I never saw what they were describing until, as I exited the cemetary, I stopped the car to "call them on their bluff" of seeing strange lights. I parked along the road's edge after turning out of the cemetary driveway. It was then that I saw, through my open drivers' side window, a red, soupcan shaped, glowing object - the color of a reflector for driveway entrances. It was positioned about three feet above the ground, over the grassy ditch portion of the corner area where the cemetary driveway met he road. It didn't register for me that it was glowing of it's own power - not reflecting light from my car's lights. I thought that a reflector was exactly what it was and opened my door to prove it. As soon as my leg moved to step out, the objct took off. It moved quick and silent. The cylinder shape was traveling so that the cylinder was verticle in relation to the ground (like a bar glass slides accross the bar to the customer - not horizontal like a thrown spear) . It moved parallel to the groud and to the road. It glided at a steady and fast speed remaing about three feet above the ground. I was so startled and frightened, I slammed my car door closed and drove away as fast as I could. Even though I drove in the same direction as the object traveled I did not see it again. I wasn't looking for it. I was watching my gas gage at nearly empty and was trying to drive to get away from it. I have wished ever since that I had not been so hasty in my get-away. I wish I had taken more time to watch it and find more clues about what it was. My friends tell a longer version of this event, however, they saw more than I and I feel that I can only speak for what I saw.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright colorfull glowing ballMy wife and I video taped an object glowing blue, green, red, and white in one place for about an hour out our back door from 3:00AM until 4:00AM. Object is slowly moving from east to west sky. Called flight services and MPLS airport reported no aircraft in the area. My wife has seen this before and I didn't believe her. This time she woke me up. We don't know what this is, rotating and changing color fairly rapidly. Have video and pictures and will hope to get any explanation. [NUFORC Note: Possible star. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Flash of light in skyA group of friends, my wife, and I were leaving Minnehaha falls park after dinner at Sea Salt (highly recommended chow, incidently) and were walking back to the parking lot (the one by the Ford bridge, along the Deer Pen valley) . Suddely the whole sky flashed green. Same sort of green you see with the northern lights. The light seemed to come from everywhere at once. It was present for just a split second and then it was dark again. I noticed it and asked if anyone else had seen it. A few had, a few had not (perhaps they had been looking down or blinking) . While I know that this is not quite an "object" siting, despite chatting it over we could not come up with an explanation and thus it is "unidentified". Any sort of Tesla / HAARP activity recorded during around this time?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Very Bright object and I mean Very Bright! watched about 5 min. returned 15 min later goneWent outside to have a cigerette on my deck. While looking south at the moon, at about SSE, there was an object that was was Very Bright, way to bright to be star or planet and way to bright to be a plane sitting stationary (we are right in the fly way for an airport so we know what planes look like coming in) . I called my wife and had her come out and she also witnesed the object. The object was there tell I finished my cigerette. When I went back out about about 15 minutes later it was gone. I probably would not have reported it, but noticed some one in MTKA MN had seen what sounds to be the exact same thing (and where I was looking was right where MTKA would be) but there sighting seems to be a little later. Whatever it was, it was BRIGHT. [NUFORC Note: We note that the planet Mars would have been in generally the same area of the sky that the witness indicates above. PD][ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS]I have already sent a report on this, but wanted to mention a mistake I made. The object I seen was SSW. Would of there been possibly a star in this area? I was looking directly South. The moon was out and this object was was about halfway between the horizon and the moon and about 15 degrees to the right. Exactly where the MTKA sighting was on the same date. Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see. If anyone could just give me friendly email to let me know, it would be very much appreciated. I Have always been very interested in UFO's ever since as a child at the age of about 13 me and about 6 other kids were out in a swampy area in Minnetonka, where I grew up. We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were (if you held out a marble in your fingers that's about how spaced they were) , the triangle had to be so far apart I can't even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn't see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive. I hope I am not wasting your time, but after seeing that I have always been very interested.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two UFO's Sighted in Northern MNMy husband and I were out on our back deck when I noticed 3 white, blinking lights in the southern sky. We thought it was unusual to have 3 airplanes that close together, especially since we don't see many planes here in northern MN. They were headed in a westerly direction. One of the lights eventually veered SW and then we heard the sound of it's jet engines so we knew it was indeed an airplane. The other two blinking lights continued to travel west, making no sound, and then suddenly one of them took a 90 degree turn, which surprised us because airplanes can't turn that quickly. It turned again and continued to travel in a NW direction with the other blinking light. We followed their course in the sky for about 10 minutes when suddenly it looked as if they connected to each other and 4 GIANT beams of light shone down from the craft. It was almost too bright to look at but you could definitely tell there were 4 lights. It illuminated a very large area. This lasted for about 5 minutes and then just disappeared. No more blinking lights at all.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> two-yellowish lights in the southern sky followed by planes coming up to the vincinityThis all started when I was going to wash my dishes since they were soaking in the sink. But, I looked outside and I seen this bright light in the sky. I watched these objects stay in one spot for at least 5 minutes in the same spot of the sky. So I ran to my 2nd bedroom window in my apartment and that's when the planes started coming from the western night sky. So I ran back to my kitchen window to see what was going to happen. When the planes came up to the sky, that's when things got really interesting. When the planes came from the western sky, one of them went over the middle object since they were in the original spot from where I first saw them. When the plane went over the middle object, I lost track of the plane since I was focused on what the light was. I'm not even sure what happened to the other plane, but I'm sure both of them just took off. But, when the planes came to where the objects were, the objects started traveling north towards my apartment. I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky. So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous. The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it. But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky. From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object. I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward. I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane. Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound. But, back to the lights, there were only read lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane. There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line. I believe there were about three or four red lights that were blinking in a pattern. That's pretty much what I can remember. I witnessed this from within city limits and I'm hoping others saw this as well. So if you're in the area and saw something, please report it.

Although it did look like a star, it was far to large, and was pulsating.

Then while looking at mars a light came out of nowhere just to the left of mars it and started moving toward south and slowly turning easterly it was moving slow it was not a plane or jet it just had the one light and it did not blink, my neighbor just backed out of the driveway and took off and a lady giving her dog a early morning walk just went by my house, I was standing on the steps which face west and walked down to the middle of my driveway and I was looking for this light, and it had stopped directly to the south just above the horizion! It just sat there I watched it and it watched me the light was moving around back and forth up and down just floating in the sky and it looked like little white lights would go around it once in a while and seems to give off some sort of light flashes it was bright there was like light branching off the top to the left and right of the object, kind of like when you squint your eyes and look at a light. It was about 6:30 now I went in the house to lay down I was still tired too earlty to get up yet. I dozed off and woke up about 7:05am sure enough the light was still up there moving around and bobbing up and down, then just all of a sudden it vanished just as strange as it appeared! There was no engine noise the whole time I had been viewing it and it was approx. the height of the smaller planes when they go by I know it was not a star or a plane or jet or satlelite!

Fading while falling this object took a rounded left turn just above the cloud deck. T hen the object turned fast (rounded) right and then fast (rounded) left. Then the object took a turn upward and faded. All the while I wondered if the commercial airline pilots had witnessed it as well.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Three light triangle over cabins near Grand Rapids, MNThis may well have been a regular aircraft, although, to me it seemed very unusual. I was at a cabin resort near Grand Rapids, MN. While walking alone from one cabin to another at about 10:30 PM on a clear night, I looked up to see, between the trees, a set of three white lights in a trangular fromation going overhead. I only got a good look at it for about 15-20 seconds. It seemed very low in the sky and was traveling fairly slowly. There was absolutely no sound associated with it and no flashing lights of any kind, nor any red lights like you would see on a normal aircraft at night. The lack of sound or flashing lights is what made it unusual. The cabin area was quiet, being in the countryside vacationers already settling in for the night. So, if there had been noise from the craft I definately would have heard it. Is there any type of normal aircraft that would behave in this way?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large glowing light hovering low on the horizonMy family and I were driving home from a Thanksgiving celebration at my parents house in Caledonia Mn. We were a few miles out of town when I noticed a very large light in the sky very low on the horizon. My husband dismissed it at first as an airplane or a helicopter but by the time we arrived home about 30 minutes later he was convinced this was something out of the ordinary. This light was extremely bright (almost hard to look at directly for any length of time) . It seemed to hover in the same spot. I ran in the house to get my video camera and when I came back out my family and I witnessed it as it just disappeared. It was almost as if someone turned off a light. It was just gone. I am really curious to know if anyone else in my area happened to see this light. I spoke to my parents this morning and they commented that about an hour after we left their house (about the time we would have arrived home) they heard several what they said sounded like helicopters go over their house. They ran out to see them but when they got outside they noise immediatly stopped. I don't know if this is related to what we saw or not.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> moving star moving in curvy random pattern in sky seen in the minneapolis areaI was standing on my porch at around 11:30 at night smoking a cigarette and watching the stars, and after i awhile i was staring at a group of stars near the saucer of the big dipper, and all of a sudden one star, which happened to be very bright, so it had caught my attention, started to move slowly and in a straight line. at first i thought it might have been a plane and my eyes were playing tricks on me, but then it stopped, and started to move around in a random curvy pattern. i focused my eyes really hard thinking it might have just been a firefly that was realy high up, so as to look like a star, but i decided against it since there were no other fireflys out, and it was moving rather slowly, and much to high up. then, out of nowhere i heard a phone ring, and not a digital ring, but like the alarm bell rings, and it sounded like it was coming from in my bushes, which were close enough to pinpoint that that was where the sound was definatly coming from. it rang twice and then stopped, and naturally i looked in the direction taking my eyes off the star, and when i looked back up it was gone. i got pretty freaked out and ran inside my house and checked the caller id and voice mail on my phone and no missed calls ar messages showed up. the folowing nights i never saw a star in the same place again.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> True Minnesota Sighting July 1987Was at camp and walking down gravel driveway (Jasmine Trl N) toward paved road (110th St N) with a friend. Walked all the way to the road which took about 20 minutes, and turned around to walk back to camp. About halfway back I feel like something was watching me, I scanned the field then the sky and there it was. It looked just like the older ufo footage of the saucer type ones, it was silver in color but the bottom was dark. It was to the south of us and a guess would be 1, 500-3, 000 feet, object was at least 20-40 feet round in diameter. It was a perfect still day with no clouds, all blue. It had a mirage effect to it, like when your on a road when its steaming hot out and you get that wavey heat effect when you look in the distance, I could sense a type of energy coming from it. From the time we first saw it until the time we walked back to camp, it did not move or make a sound. Bear in mind this is a very wooded area but about 5 minutes into the walk the woods clear and there is nothing but sky and fields forever. The ufo was not in the sky when we were walking toward the road, so I know it was moving and stopped sometime after we turned around to walk back. We walked and then ran back to camp after we had observed it for about 20 minutes, this was a mistake. We got back and told a counselor and we ran with him to the clearing and it was gone, and I knew it would be, one of us should have stayed with it until we got another person to see it, or at least one of us would have seen it move, who believes two teenagers. This is the only time I have seen a ufo in person and I regret not waiting it out. I was 15 then 33 now and I will always remember this because I know it was real, I have a camcorder on hand at all times now since the mid-90s and have never seen one again.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Possible sighting in Plymouth, MNWife woke up to a bright "almost purple white light" outside of 1st level apartment. Looked like a helicoptor search light, but stationary and brighter. Children in 3rd floor apartment woke up screaming and ran into parents bedroom screaming of aliens and to shut the door. Child is 2 years old and hasn't watched anything regarding aliens or UFO's. Wife saw light closed eyes thinking it was a plow, but there was no snow on the street to be plowed, no cars on the street either. Opened eyes again to see it was still there, got out of bed and it "disappeared". There was no sound when it disappeared or when it was visible.<br>

<b>REPORTED:</b>  2/3/2006<br><br>
<b>SHAPE:</b>  Cylinder<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  3 min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> In Brookyln Park MN, late at night, a silver matalic cylindrical object, floated past our window. I apologize if you are not interested in past sighting. It is just that it has never left my mind, but I had never reported it. I am not exact on the date and time (I lived there from Jan-March of '88, and I just remember it being late at night.) One of my roommates and I were in the living room, and we had no lights on in that area. We lived on the top floor of an apt. complex. . I believe 3rd or 4th. I had seen something out the window in the sky. I called my roommate over and we watched as a cylindrical/silver metallic object floated by for few minutes. I wish I could give exact depth/measurements. . but that was difficult then and even more, since so much time has pasted. My impression is that it was low, yet somewhat above the building, it didn't seem far off either, maybe 50 feet straight out yet we were looking up towards it. It was dark that night but clear, with street/city type lights present. To me, it only appeared about 3 feet tall and if I got a hold of it, as if I could just get my arms wrap around it. I don't remember any lights, ignition source, exhaust emanating, sound, or distinguishing marks. It FLOATED up right, like we walk. No jerking or fast movements, just a steady float in a forward direction. That is what was most bizarre, what made it float? I remember trying to rationalize it. . see if it was connected to something, like electrical wires, etc. . asking my roommate the whole time if she sees what I do, and what does she think. She said yes, but was speechless beyond that (even, was so freaked out after, that she never would make claim to it again.) What kept coming to mind, was a probe of sorts, not a space ship with aliens, but who knows. As it continued on that steady floating forward path, it cleared the corner of our building, making it so we couldn't see it anymore. I ran down stairs in only a tee shirt, out the nearest door to our last sighting, into the winter cold, to find no trace of it.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A fleet of at least 100 disc shaped UFOs dancing across the sky!My husband and I were frying steaks on the deck- a sunny Saturday afternoon. I happened to look up and saw something off in the distance. As we watched it get closer, we realized that we were seeing, what I later found out, was a "fleet" of UFOs! At least 100 of them dancing across the sky silent, graceful- making all kinds of formations and designs. We continued to watch in awe for about ten minutes until they were were lost to our vision by trees blocking our view. They were a shiny, metalic, disc shape. About a minute later, a jet appeared and seemed be chasing the group. This event has puzzled us until this past week when we watched a program on the History Channel titled "Mexico's Roswell". THERE THEY WERE!!! Footage of EXACTLY what we saw this past August. What do they want?!<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  30 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I let my dog out to go to the bathroom. Across the street was a huge brilliant cluster of light. Not moving, just perfectly still above the tree line. I waited to see if it could be an airplane in distress. Then an airplane was higher in the sky and I knew this was much, much larger than a regular plane. So I ran in to get my binoculars, I looked through them and it was just a glistening huge ball of light. So I thought I will wake my husband so he could see. He came out, looked through the binoculors and said, "I don't know what it is, what do you think it is?" I said I did not know. So he went back inside. Within minutes it slowly drifted across in a straight line. I waited, and after some minutes it slowly started moving towards my home, the closer it got the faster the speed was. I watched it go over my head, still very brilliant. I heard a faint sound of a muffled engine. The center of the object had a small red light, the rest of the lights were brilliant white (with that sparkly glow) . I could not make out the shape very clearly because by this time the speed had increased. But I only made out a pointed side heading east, with a small tail shape as in a tail of a plane where the logo usually is. But comparing it to a regular plane, it was considerably larger! I watched it as it moved out of sight.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The object had no blinking lights and went in 3 different directions, but those turns were faster than what an airplane could achieveI was with my girlfriend in my car, looking at the stars and she noticed this light that wasn't blinking moving North. We were west of the object. She then noticed it moving back in the direction that it came from, but without making any turns like an airplane. Then, she saw it move East and it went back in it's original direction which is North. I saw it moving North after it did it's turns and it was moving very fast, faster than what an airliner or private plane would be able to go. There were also no other planes in the vicinity.<br>

I said "look at that!" and my daughters first reaction was "WOW!!!" We told my wife (whose a skeptic) and it was almost impossible to explained. My wife told me never do that again. . . I will.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangular shaped object seen over rural roadWhile driving home with my mother on a rural road I saw a very low flying object cross our path traveling northwest. The object had bright green, red and I think white lights and appeared to be triangular or boomerang shaped. It appeared to be moving slower than a plane would be flying and it wasn't loud like a low flying plane or jet usually is. In fact I don't remember it making any noise at all. It flew almost directly over our car and I lost site of it as it moved over trees on the other side of the road. I asked my mother if she saw it and she said she did. I then asked if it was a plane and she said she didn't know. We continued home and did not really speak of the incident again.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I have already sent a report on this, but wanted to mention a mistake I made. The object I seen was SSW. Would of there been possibly a star in this area? I was looking directly South. The moon was out and this object was was about halfway between the horizon and the moon and about 15 degrees to the right. Excatly where the MTKA sighting was on the same date. Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see. If anyone could just give me friendly email to let me know, it would be very much appreciated. I Have always been very interested in UFO's ever since as a child at the age of about 13 me and about 6 other kids were out in a swampy area in Minnetonka, where I grew up. We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were (if you held out a marble in your fingers that's about how spaced they were) , the triangle had to be so far apart I can't even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn't see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive. I hope I am not wasting your time, but after seeing that I have always been very interested. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The following sighting reports are very similar to the one my mother, father, North Minneapolis and I had back in 1975. This is the second time it's happened to a friend of mine, his story: He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow) . When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N. As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the "construction sight". Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building. He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the "construction sight" and the women were. This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level. It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it. He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field. 'He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all. (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.) He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor's, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes. He said he told this person, "Man, come and see this shit!" But when they got to the window, the craft was gone. He said the guy then asked him, "What shit?", and my friend said he told him, "Man. . . NEVER MIND" He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left. I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously "they" set it up this way.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Four separate bright white lights traveling across the sky, distort the light from stars as they pass. On Saturday night, May 6th, 2006 at approximately 23:45, my two adult son's and I observed an unusual object moving accros the sky. We were standing outside in an area devoid of light so that the evening sky was clear. We were in Winona, Minnesota. It was a beautiful night without a cloud in the sky. A loose formation of 4 points of white light traveling from East to West were observed. The 4 points of light were of equal intensity, remaining constant at about the brightness level of a bright star. The 4 objects were separate, moving independantly from one another, seaminly to dart about in a loose formation, all traveling together. As we stood near a tall industrial building, the objects were seen as they came over the roof of the building and then disapeared about 5 seconds later. The most unusual thing about the objects was the area around and in-between them. The space around and between the objects of the formation seamed to ripple as though the light from starts in the background was being distorted. It was like a large bubble of water traveling across the sky, distorting the light, we could clearly see through it but distorted and rippling. There was absolutly no sound, silent. Our first impression was that the objects were close. It then appeared that the objects were at very high altitude (or maybe not even flying near the earth) traveling at a very high rate of speed. Then, as the objects flew to a point about 90 degrees from the initial sighting, they just vanished. I'm 60 years old and have seen many strange things in life, but Ive never seen anything like this before.<br>

They looked like they were not moving, except for the fact that they were "blinking" in and out of view. A comparison that I could make is that of the scene in the movie Superman when the bad guys were floating in space in aa flat glass that was spinning --only in this case when they looked like they would start to spin or flutter they would disapear in thin air-all of them at once. Then they reappeared in the exact same formation, looking exactly the same and would flicker for about 10 seconds-until they disapeared again. This flickering in and out happened about 4 or 5 times--then I didnt see them again. It was a clear day-only a few clouds in the sky--and they were so clear and so precise in its repeating formation. My background-is Im a 29 year old female. Im in college studying Sociology and Physics, and I have two young kids.

I oberseved that the craft moved in mutliple directions, but only for a short periods of time before it came back to "center. " It moved up, down, left, and right. I saw this after he had called and told me to look tward Hutchinson, which is about 20 miles north-west of my home. It was about 35-45 degrees up when I saw it, and was, well, two stars down from the edge of the big dipper. I called another friend of mine, just to make sure I wasn't seeing things, she oberved the same shape as well. I tried looking at it later, but was unable becuase the stars had moved and I could not refrence it to any stationary body. Thanks for your time.<br>

I could tell the craft was moving in the same direction I was. I saw small lights of reddish orange in what appeared to be the back of the craft. It was about the size of a large home. I have never seen any craft that ever loked as unique or as impressive as this one. I looked at the craft for only about 10 seconds due to my driving at night. The craft quickly disappeared. When I arrived home, my brother in law discribed seeing the same green craft coming out of the sky and hovering behind trees about 5-8 minutes before I saw the craft. He mentioned that while he was driving, another car in front of him must have seen the craft also because they put on their brakes and slowed down. He thought it was going to crash on or near the road due to it's descending angle towards the ground.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large red ball of light that multiplied into four separate lights at tree level, white lights flying at high altitudes. I was sitting inside the house watching TV when a flash of light in the southern sky caught my attention. It was a very clear night, and I saw multiple white lights moving across the sky at high altitudes independently of each other. I don't think they were satellites because they did not move in a steady line across the sky, instead they zig-zagged from east to west. As I was standing outside watching the lights, a large red ball of light appeared above the tree line in the southern sky. I was so frightened that I got in my car and drove 4 miles down the road to get my neighbor so he could see what i was seeing. He wasn't there so I went back home, hoping they would be gone. It was there again (or still) and then seemed to split or multiply. The second ball of light emerged in front of the first one, the third emerged from the second one, and by the time there was four lights I had gotten in my car and was speeding to another neighbor's house. By the time we got back it was gone, but the white lights were still in the southern and western sky. My neighbor thought that they might be military aircraft watching the American/Canadian border. I had no idea who to contact, so it wasn't documented at all. I've never witnessed any type of activity like this before, so it really makes me curious as to what I may have seen.<br>

I first thought that it was a star/planet. But the light was SO bright and started moving side to side at first then up and down. Not far apart but close proximity of the area. I woke up my husband and we went out side to look at it. He thougt it was a star but quickly realized IT was moving the other stars were not. This was quite an amazing event we've never seen anything like it. I would love someone to explain this to me. We are both small business owner's in a small town in Northern Minnesota, this was amazing.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> White balls in the Sky. This was years ago but I just see the same thing today on the history channel (UFO Files) about balls of light seen in Mexico. I was working as a volunteer aircraft mechanic on old world war 2 aircraft at the Planes of Fame Air Museum at Flying Cloud Airport. We were standing out on the tarmac working on some of the aircraft when are head mechanic pointed out some white balls off in the distance. We all had a hard time seeing them. But there was about 15 to 20 balls moving up and down in rapid movements. We watched the strange balls moving around for about 15 minuets before we had to get back to work. 2 of our pilots seen the balls as well and dint know what to make of them. Both pilots worked for major airlines and one was a former naval aviator. I'm sorry but I cant recall the exact time or date being that it was about 9 years ago.

I was laying in bead at 11:10 and noticed bright lights flashing. a tree obstructed my view, but i was able to see light moving from the sky down to tree and house level and back up again. I could not identify a shape because the light was bright in an asymetrical form. Im going to say it landed because it hovered in a way for a long time at house level. I could not get a clear shot because i did not have a camera at hand and my camera phone had too much glare from the window.<br>

When we got home I looked at the object thru our binoculars. Now I could see that instead of 1 light it was composed of 4 lights that were rotating. The object remained almost stationary for the entire sighting. At 23:15 it dropped below the tree line and I couldn't see it anymore. I have about 15 minutes of video of the object. The object seemed to be about 30 degrees up from the horizon. As I watched the object, a bright star rotated into view close to the object and then set during the hour and 45 minutes of observation.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> about 1:17 am over 252 in brooklyn center, evergreen park elementary, a brightly lit object hovered closer and closer to us. a group of us walked over to evergreen park elementary and were by the pavilion, when one of us noticed something in the sky. he said, " what the hell is that? is that a ufo?" and we all looked and sure enough there was a saucer shaped thing. so we stared at it for about 4 minutes and took pictures on a cell phone and recorded some, but all that showed up was a little white dot. what we saw was brightly lit and had sparkly stuff all over it. it "hovered" to the right a little bit and then would change direction and go to the left. we finally got an idea to walk to the car that was about 3 blocks away and kept looking back when we noticed that it was following us. when we saw it the first time, it was behind some trees and when we were going to the car, it was closer to us and not behind the trees. so we ran to the car fast as we could and drove onto 252 to get a closer look. when we got to 252 there was nothing and if it was a plane or a blimp or something then it couldnt have landed that fast. we never believed in this kind of stuff before and we all couldnt believe our eyes. now we know that there really is stuff out there that needs to be checked out. there was only one craft and it was really bright with lights all around.<br>

It was far off in the night sky, clear night. It had the oddest single blinking red light I'd ever seen, far too bright to be a satellite of any sort. I expected to be able to hear something, thinking maybe it was a plain or something, but all there was was dead silence. This thing REALLY creeped me out. It eventually just kept flying off into the horizon. . [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

By my window there are no streets at all, and this was up in the sky. I saw it go behind some trees, and I saw it fully again. I rushed to the kitchen to get my camera phone, but I didn't look and the door was shut, so I ran into it. I ran back to the window to see if it was still there, but it was gone.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Woke up at 300 am , compelled to go over to window, bright star light approaches windowshade. I was around 10 years old at the time when this happened. I am certain it was not a dream. I woke up at 3 am for no apparent reason. I was compelled to go over to my window and open the window shades in my bedroom that sits on the second story and faces south east. When I opened up the window shade I began fixating on a brighter than usual star in the clear night sky. A moment later the "star" light began to move at a moderate pace toward my position. I began to get a little anxious as this was happening. The circular light kept on getting brighter and larger as it approached. At this point I was beginning to freak out. The circular light was then about 500 feet from my window and was incredibly bright and large in shape. My guess is that it was 100 feet wide by 100 feet tall maybe. The object at this point was about a 20 feet above me in height. What I remember is that it was taking up most of my field of vision. At this point I slammed the window shade and ran quickly into my parents room to wake them up. We went back to the window, my dad did I was too afraid and there was nothing there. Now this sounds like a bad dream, but I know it was real. I have had bad dreams though they take place in my bed not standing at a window. My sister too this day remembers this night as well, as the night her brother claimes to have seen a UFO. I am writing this now because I recently watched a televsion show about the Highland, IL lights that brought me back to my experience.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Blue and Purple Fireball with noise sightedOn a clear, Saturday night, me and my sister witnessed 2 different colored fireballs that had a "light hissing sound". At around 10:00 PM on that Saturday night, I was looking out my window in the night sky searching for the space shuttle "Atlantis", when I noticed right where I was staring a bright blue fireball emmiting "sparks" and a light hissing sound. Astonished by what I had just witnessed, I jetted downstairs into my living room to explain to my sister what I had seen in full detail. I excited my sister greatly, so much, that she decided to search for what she thought, were 'shooting stars'. Now, I personally didn't think that it was a shooting star, and if it was, it must have been a heck of a bolide. So I took a shower after that, and when I finished, my sister told me that she saw a purple one. I am not sure if this is true, since she is young, and has an imagination, but she does not often lie. This spectacle amazed me to the point in which I'll never forget. [NUFORC Note: Probable hoax from student, we believe. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Glowing green object crosses Twin Cities at low altitudeI was driving home alone on westbound highway 36 in Roseville MN. It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car. I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds. It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis. I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve. When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone. Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was. At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane. Its pale green light was steady, not blinking. And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line. I have never seen any plane do like this. And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO. He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it. He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west. He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds. But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead. And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane. And the craft was perfectly silent. I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> "Star" observed moving erratically through the evening skyLast night, at approximately 8:35 PM, I went outside to have a cigarette, and I love the night sky, so I was looking up at the stars, and I noticed one "star" in particular that appeared to be moving rapidly across the sky. I kept my eye on it as I tried to come up with a rational explanation for what it could be, but the longer I watched it, the more erratic it's movements became. It would stop, change directions, hover, and it did appear to move at different speeds. At one point, it disappeared behind a cloud, but it reappeared momentarily. It was either too small or too far away for me to actually be able to tell what it was, like I said, I thought it was just a star until it started moving. I did notice what appeared to be an airplane about 3 minutes into the sighting, although it seemed to be traveling in the opposite direction (NNW) and at a lower altitude. The "star" was last seen traveling ESE.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Four dim lights in a row, flew over my head. One object or four seperate objectsI was walking home from work (Bartender) I was not drinking. I happened to look up to my right when I saw a row of dim lights, what seem to be close, right above me (about 200yards) It could have been one thing or four seperate things. They made no noise- hum or buzzing- nothing. It moved a little faster than I was walking. The four lights did not blink or flash, they were very dim. If I was not looking right at them I would not have seen them. In about 15 seconds it was ahead of me. I started to run in the direction it was moving. I'm not sure but it might have increased it's speed than disapeared over the sight line. I tried to tell myself that it was the belly of birds reflecting light from a near by Hospital's parking lot lights.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> circular, lime-green object with a tracer lime-green tailI was driving Hwy. 56 (so.) , 3/4 of a before the Cty Rd. 19 turn towards Cannon Falls, at approximately 10:30PM. My peripheral vision caught site (left side) of a 'lime green' (10x's plus the size of a shooting star) . At first, I thought it to be a shooting star - I realized it wasn't a shooting star, when I actually stared at it. It shot from left to right - moving speed similar to speed of shooting star, if not faster. It was circular - lime green with a lime green (tracer) tail that was the length of - if you look directly straight forward to when your peripheral vision took place. I watched it go towards my right and diappeared behind a black rain cloud. (there was distant light from lightening where I saw the black (dark) cloud) . The angle - object flew like a shooting star, but, was descending like a falling star - then vanished. When I saw this, my heart started jumping - made me excited to see such a site. I mentioned this to my friends that night - most sad I'm crazy or I made this up and one did say that it could of been an asterroid. I only wish my camera was available, and if it was, I wasn't fast enough to get the photo. It was amazing! Please get back at me regarding this issue. I would like to know if this WAS a UFO. And if this moment was a moment to remember, I'd like to smile about it. Thank You for time![NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  3 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> BRIGHT light low in the sky- middle of the day. Driving mid-day, saw a BRIGHT light a couple of miles to the south - like a reflection from a plane. But usually a reflection would last only a second or 2 while the plane moves or while car is moving. This thing looked as though it was a helicopter or small plane- only because it was so low- like right above the little town of St. Boni. A couple minutes later, when I drove into town, this light/ object was WAY off the horizon- into the "high clouds". -like farther away than any of the other jet liners in the sky. As far as the eye can see. Yet, still bright. Remind you:I could see this light the entire 3 minutes of driving into this town. I couldnt take my eyes off it. I guess becaues it looked like a big "something" that was not moving- and so close to the ground. It looked like a bright star. Or like I said before, the reflection of a jet liner. I could not see any object, only light. I generally do not believe in ufo's. . . But I have been brainstorming on what light this was, and how did it move so far away, so fast. I have no explaination.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> very long row of red lights above gravel pit horizonI'm sorry that I can't be very specific as it's been many years, however, somethings are ingrained in my memory. Honestly, I'm not really sure of the time of year, but it seems like it was winter, no cloud cover, clear night sky. I was coming home from work as a bartender. . no, I had not been drinking. I'm guessing at the time, somewhere between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM as the bar closed at one, and I was usually out of the building by 1:30-1:45 headed south towards Elk River, which was where I was living at the time. There is a large gravel pit that I passed by each night on my way home, and this night, as I approached I saw, briefly, what looked like along the ridge at the top of the pit, was a line of red lights. My first thought was that it was a line of semi trucks parked along the ridge. But what I saw was at least the entire length of the ridge of the pit, and I can't say now if it was one long light, or many lights, but whatever it was was just above the ridge, directly above treeline. Then, it was gone, the row of lights just went down, below the ridge. . at least that's how it seemed. No one end moved faster than the other, there was no angles. . it just droped below the horizon of the ridge and was gone. I drove by a few days later, daylight hours, to get an idea of what the ridge looked like during the day, if there was a road along the ridge, what, exactly was there. There was no road along the ridge where the lights were. There was a road that led to an area near the ridge, but nothing at the ridge. To be fair, it was even difficult at the time to estimate the size, or length of what I saw that night, but going back to look at it in the daylight I'd have to say bigger than a football field in length, much bigger. I didn't see anything besides the lights. . no shadows of any kind, nothing to indicate that there was anything but lights, although I know that's not likely. Looking at the 'Characteristics of The object" section in this web form, I will select 'There were lights in the object' only because that's all I saw. . I didn't actually see an object. . just lights. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate. PD]<br>

As I was observing the late night streets (at the time it was about 10:00 pm) i noticed an extremely bright green flash that occupied the entire sky for about a split second, brighter than lightning. I was slightly horrified and scared by what I had just seen. I thought it was a mere hallucination, until I told my friend at the bus stop about a week later, and he said that he had seen it as well. These flashes seem to go on regularly around my area for some strange reason in which I don't know, but no flash was as bright as I had just seen.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This really happened and I would like an explanation! Read it and believe it. I was getting into our hot tub out off of our deck. As always I look up and enjoy the stars. I've been a star gazer my whole life. I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE! The thing was flying across the sky heading due south and off to the east a bit, not directly overhead. One red light very dim with two sets of two directly behind. the whole thing was very small which I believe to be actually very high in the sky. -Unbelievably- fast and the real thriller is the [deleted] thing slowed to almost a stop and took off in another direction. I couldn't believe my eyes. I tried to write it off as a helicopter but I heard NO SOUND. My wife and friend came out shortly after and we hung out for a while. I told them what I saw and I don't think they believe me. Anyway we soaked in the tub for a while and my wife went in the house. Our friend and I sat for a bit longer and intrigued I kept watching the sky. A few meteors throughout about an hour and one thing blew my mind. It started out like a meteor but in the direct opposite path of the first unexplainable object. It was a light that appeared and faded out like a meteor but it reappeared and faded and appeared again across the entire sky due north. I of course yelled for our friend to look but she didn't see it. This too was going incredibly fast. O. k. Now I'm starting to freak out a bit. I've always believed in Carl Sagan about being alone. The real clincher is and this just happened one hour ago is that goddamn red thing went back south again in the exact same path. one red light very dim with two sets of two. if you weren't looking you wouldn't see it at the same speed and damn near the same path. It wasn't an aircraft of anything conventional. No disc shapes either. it was too high and way too fast for anything I have ever seen. I have always thought there has to be life out there but now i have NO DOUBT. I would appreciate and explanation of what it was I saw tonight. Duluth has a state of the art airguard base and I bet they know what! it was or if they don't they BETTER because if what I saw is hostile we are doomed. [NUFORC Note: We do not know what the first object was, the the intermittent light, which moved from north to south, may have been a tumbling rocket booster in orbit. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two green lights over 10, 000 lakes festival 3am sunday morning 7-24-05, blast into skyMy friend and I were sitting around a campfire and we were talking about our weekend. There had been a lot of fireworks being shot off that earlier that night, but there were some "fireworks" in the distance that wouldn't go away. My friend was the first to point it out, but once he pointed I saw them. There were two green lights hovering stationary above the horizon, about 2-3 miles away (estimated) . We thought they were sparks from the fireworks that were falling to the ground, but they never fell and they were very large at the distance we were viewing them. They started to move apart from one another slowly in a horizontal manner. Then the light on the right moved vertical above the one on the left. At this point my mind was reeling trying to figure out what this was we were watching. Next, the lower light moved to be even with the light on the right and very quickly after they were even, the light on the right blasted straight up ward at a speed I have never witnessed before, very very fast. After that one was about half way out of sight the other one on the left took off at equal fast speed. These lights never changed colors they stayed bright green the whole time. They never left a trail of light either, just a small bit behind the craft as they went up into the sky. Despite possibly being tired we were not on any drugs or alcohol to alter our state of mind.<br>

I picked my son up from wrestling practice in the evening after school. We lived out in the country at the time and as we were driving home, we came up a hill and just as we topped the hill and were going to go down the other side, an object came over our car just above our heads, so low and so fast that we both ducked down thinking something was going to strike us. It encompassed the whole width of our peripheral vision appeared to be just above treetop level. I jammed on the brakes and we jumped out and saw nothing behind us. I then backed up to see if it could have been ground fog. This time as we came back up the hill there was no evidence of any ground fog and the night was fairly clear as I recall. We had no idea of what this could have been, but it was huge, shiny and was over and past us so fast that if there were lights visible, we could never have seen them. Just another unsolved, unexplained mystery that remains imbedded in our memories. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> First of all, I reported this to two local police departments within 15 minutes of witnessing this &#39;object&#39; in the sky. Police department A told me to contact police department B beacuse, and I quote, &quot;There is a report of a missing person in that county&quot;. It was located, from my best estimate, between 500 feet and 5000 feet in the air Southwest of Raymond, Minnesota between the hours of 0300 and 0345. The police departments (A &amp; B) had no knowledge of any airborne object in the sky in the location that I had mentioned. The object looked like it could have been a rectangular object or a spherical shape. It hovered in one spot for the entire time I was looking at it. It had a blue, red, and white light. The blue and the red lights were twice as prominent as the white light. The white light seemed as it was the light of a white house. My vantage point did not give me adequate means to give me solid knowledge that it emanated a beam of some sort. I was not able to find out any additional information from the local police departments and was not contacted by the police departments after I filed the report. This is not a joke and why I have been led to even write you is because of the idea of a missing person and a UFO does not sit well with me. I prefer to keep this discreet but welcome a phone call.<br>

A commercial jet also went by at a lower altitude, although it did not take evasive action.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  1 Minute?<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Giant triangle-shaped craft at very low altitude right over North MinneapolisSometime in the Summer of 1993, when I was 12 years old, me, my brother, and my best friend [name deleted] were playing outside. We were going about our business as usual on the blacktop hill at the school across the street from my house. The weather was perfect. At any rate, I saw [name deleted] eyes get real wide as he looked at the sky. I looked up and what I saw was amazing. I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft of some kind. I can clearly recall that the bottom was bordered with a green glowing light, and there was a large circular orange light right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center. When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something. As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc. . . But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me. So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object. I don't actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me. I took one last look up as I darted into the house, and there was nothing there. An odd side note. My brother only remembers seeing the thing from a very far distance. He remembers a big ass light far up in the sky and that's about it. [name deleted] remembers the thing descending, but he doesn't remember it getting nearly as close as I do.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Soundless fast moving craft with red pulsing light on bottomMy wife and I were camping at Frontenac State Park in Minnesota. We were laying on our backs looking at a clear night sky, with approximately 160 degrees of sky visible. I am the son of an aeronautics engineer, and have been raised around all types of commercial and military aircraft. I grew up near an Air Force base, and have observed hundreds of various aircraft in flight, both at night and in the daytime. This particular night, while viewing the stars, an object moved toward us from the south. It was very dark and difficult to determine the shape. It had one distinguishing feature: a single pulsing red light on the bottom of the craft. The size of the pulsing light led me to determine that the craft was only a few hundred feet off the ground, yet the craft was moving at a high rate of speed with absolutely no sound. My experience tells me that only a jet-propelled craft or very high-powered turboprop could move at this speed, typically with lots of noise associated, particularly at this altitude. This craft was absolutely silent. It moved south to north, spanning my field of vision in less than 15 seconds. My wife and I both saw the craft and corroborated what we had seen and agreed completely that we had witnessed a craft that did not exist in any records or memory that we had. That is all.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> TRIANGULAR CRAFT HOVERING AT HAMPTON, MINNESOTA - 04:00 AUGUST 2006I was driving on highway 52 south from Minneapolis to my home in Rochester. I am a 53 year-old male RN and had just finished working. I saw a bright light on over the highway in the distance and thought that an airliner was approaching the Minneapolis airport prematurely. As I drove closer, I then thought that the light was a medical helicopter and I was about to come upon an accident. As I reached Hampton, a very small town than highway 52 passes through, I was astonished to see a triangular shaped craft hovering motionlessly a few hundred feet from the highway, only at about 500 feet of altitude. The light that I had seen was a unidirectional spotlight mounted on top of the craft, on some kind of pole or extension device. A county sheriff's patrol car was parked with its lights off observing the craft. Although I had a camera in the car, I nearly had a panic attack from seeing something that defied my imagination. I drove slowly by the scene and the craft continued to hover as I saw it in my rear view mirror as I drove away. I saw no visible means of propulsion on either the underside or sides of the craft. No vents, no heat plume, and absolutely no noise.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Green lights from georgia to Minnesota?May be related to the Georgia Green Light Case. We left the BP Gas station near the intersection of US HWY 10 and Jamaica Ave S in Cottage Grove, MN At approx 1830 hrs. We were headed NW direction on US HWY 10 from Cottage Grove, MN towards St. Paul, MN. As we were driving past the exit for 80th St and US Hwy 10 the sky above the refinery became visible. The sky was overcast, dark and a fine mist was in the air, the temperature was above freezing, perhaps in the low 40s. My daughter Kourtney (14) and I (34-M) were in the front seat while my son Chris (12) was in the back of our Durango SUV. My daughter and I could see a distinct Green Light that appeared to be sourced within the clouds or a bit below, shining down, and flashing as if taking pictures. The light was a dull Green color that repeatedly flashed sometimes from slightly different positions over the Marathon refinery. This green beam was a dull color that did not reveal its source. We could see only the hint of a shadow with no definete outline. The mist helped to show the definete beam shape (like a spotlight) as it aimed for the ground. As each flash of the light occured, the vapor that was in the "beam" during the flash became charged and glowed like an Ionized gas. These towers or columns of light (possibly ionized gas or mist) remained much brighter than the source that appeared to be creating them. In the three to four minutes that it takes to drive towards the refinery we saw perhaps ten to fifteen formed. As we got closer to the refinery the columns of light/ gas floated away from the refinery in an eastern direction at the wind speed. I would estimate this to be about fifteen to twenty miles an hour with a lower elevation of approximately 1500 feet and a terminal elevation of 2000 feet. they were that tall. . . Also the lights seemed to be overpowered by the refineries bright tower lights. as our eyes adjusted to the brightness, it became harder to see. I doubt anyone at the refinery would have noticed these at all. There were no spotlights at the refinery either, which I looked for as some kind of explanation. As we passed the refinery, they seemed to disappear. I continued to my destination (near downtown St. Paul) and spotted the lights forming again on my return. This time the green light seemed to be a pale white or yellow light (like a sodium lamp color) but still the columns of gas/mist would form and glow and float away from the refinery, for miles! This second sighting was approximately 1900-1910 hours. I was alone so I returned home and picked up my wife (36) my step daughter (16) and my friend Mike (38) and we returned to as parking lot in Newport, MN (across the highway from the refinery) and watched these lights form repeatedly. At one point the lights were so numerous they looked like a photo of a "galactic center" with neboulous clouds and colors. This peak of activity occured around 2010-2030 hours with all of us witnessing these columnsof light. A few columns appeared over the inver grove heights river valley, and some of these "stragglers" flew directly over our head at this time. They looked like florescent lightbulbs- sort of. We listened with the windows open and did not hear a sound coming from the sky. by 2040 hours, the lights were gone and most of the columns had blown away with the wind. The approximate lattitude/ Longitude location of the refinery is: 44. 51. 08 N 93. 00. 10 W our observation point where the columns flew over us: 44. 52. 28 n 93. 00. 02 w The columns that flew above us originated approx: 44. 52. 23 n 93. 01. 17 w I did see a dark streak shoot across the lower cloud elevation suddenly at the termination of the event which was not observed by the others. No electrical effects were observed.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Explanation for 8/24/06 Flash (*please do not post, this is not a report*) Dear NUFORC, As I looked into the bright green flash event that illuminated the sky on August 24, 2006, I discovered one possible explanation for the event others that live near me wittnessed as well. One day, while speaking with my father about the event, he had said he saw the same phenomena. We talked about it, and past "green flash" events, and traced it back to an air-fuel making plant located in Rosemount, MN, which emits such flashes at times. Rosemount is about 5 miles North East of my location, and where me and a friend witnessed the same event as well. Once also, there was a powerfull explosion that came from the plant around five years ago, which illuminated the entire night sky to the point that it was seen from Eagan, MN, which is an estimated seven miles from the plant. Now I cannot fully include that this is the cause of the flash, but that is what I am now assuming the cause is. Thank you (COURTESY OF MILE DETERMINATION: GOOGLE MAPS)<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  10 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> black submarine shapes oject at ligh speed and orange blastsAn object black with lights underneath fore and aft. Impossible for me to determine its size since it blocked out any reference points I could have used. If forced to guess, i would say it was at least 60 feet long by 20 feet or so high shaped like a submarine. This means there was a distinct center high point but then again the black of the object left me with that impression. The object just appeared with no sound of any kind and or movement of leaves tree branches etc. The event takes palce on or about early June 1988. My grilfriend at the time and I were just returning from a restaurant at between 7: and 8. We were on the back prch of the house about to enter when we heard the rough missing sound of an air plane engine. As if the plane had no noise abatement of any kind and flying as the sound provoked low to the ground. We stepped back from the roof line to see what it may be, discovering it was an old rotary engine plane flying approx 200 feet. The palne was very close to us approx half a block to our true north as we were facing true east. The plane was flying directly west into the sunset. Our eyes followed the plane thinking the noise may represent engine trouble. As the plane passed us heading west and we are now looking more at the rear of the plane we noticed we couldn't see or next door neighbors house to the south. We couldn't see the street lights to ur south or the hospital to the south. In our way was a large long and high black something blocking out that area. We kept our eyes on the object leaving the back porch to approach it from our back yard. As we aproached my girlfriend and I didn't speak not a word. We both waled toward the object geting within 15 feet. Once my eyes and mind hooked up -- I realized this was anything but normal and I became uneasy. I looked off to my right or west to see the old plane beginning to bank south accross the then sunset. I looked back at te object noticing there was a lght fore, aft and mid not blinding by any means but present. I don't know if it was steady or blinking too difficult to know under the stress and confusion. Now here is the good part that can not be comprehended, I don't care who you are. The object moved directly west at a speed undefined, faster than the fasted movement I can imagine. so fast It is undescribable. All I could see was a trail the lghts made going for miles to the west in an instant. Just as suddenly, i could see the street lghts, hospital, neighbors house . . . The other most amazing aspect of the event is there was no sound or air movement. How could a large object move an incredible speed without creating a vacuum or noise only 15 feet away from me? As best I could see and it was only the trailing lights as if a picture was taken with time photography leaving the lens open. The object flew under the old plane as it continued to bank to the south and east. Immediatly after my senses returned I asked my girlfriend what was that all about and she remained stunned ans silent. After we both came to or thought we had our facilties back we went into the house to write down what we thought happened without sharing a single word other than lets write down what we saw and compare notes. We both saw the same thing and the essence of our vision is the speed at which the object moved. the blackness of theobject so we couldn't truly see its shape or size and we felt we were being looked at closely. Now the end of the story: We thought about calling our local airport sure the old plane was returning to it flying by site with what light was left. We talked ourselves out of it not wanting to draw any attention to us. The following day was a Saturday. We were washing our cars in the back yard listening to a local station on the radio. There was a break in by the announcer saying a sheriff or policeman was chasing a ufo near blue earth minnesota. the anouncer had the sheriff or policeman on line saying he would spped towrds the object getting within a block or two when the object would speed off at 90 degress at phonominal speed for a few miles and stop again. After about ten minutes the activity of the law man stopped and the station went back to normal broadcasting and not another word was said of the incident. You coulod verify the incident by calling Blue earth police it was very near to that farming comunity. Finally-- one night in the early fall and it was pitch dark out. A group of us were returning from a another night at a restaurant -- no drinking-- at or about 8;00 when we noticed a huge explosion like lobe orange in color from the ground to about 100 feet by 100 feet and a true half circle. We had met at the restaurant so we were in idividual cars all returning home as neighbors. The area is in the country between two small towns some 15 miles apart. One is Cleveland MN and the direction of the orange lobes was toward Madison Lake MN. Every 3 to 4 minutes there would be another huge orange lobe coming from the ground and moving awa from us. We tried to follow the orage lobes like bomb blasts for the next 15 miles but couldn't keep up. As we traveled the 15 miles we could see the orange blasts from the road going into the horizon. I believe i was travelling south but not sure. It was single orange blast with no sound nothin like lightning more like a half sphere shape associtaed with a bomb blast. all of the neighbors saw it and wondered again what in the hades did we just see.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> cigar streaking across the sky eastwardOk never seen anything since that day even remotely the same. I woke up early that day and peered out the window as I often do in the morning. But this morning I saw a cigar shaped silvery object at low altitude streaking across the sky in an easterly direction. I thought it must be a jet--but it was to low and no noise was present. Even more confusing, there appeared to be no wings on this thing. I am still unsure of what I saw. It seems very strange to me to say it must have been a UFO, but I cannot rule this out. I have never seen anything remotely the same since that day. Like everyone that day -- nothing seemed real. However, I imagine if it was a UFO and this craft was moving eastward it is likely that the craft could have been on an intercept course to observe that mornings terror that would follow. I am not a UFO fanatic, and I do not aspire to be one. However, I have wondered if anyone else saw anything weird that day. I hope something good can come from my witness account of the UFO[NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

We both saw it; I watched it the whole time while my girlfriend was driving. It looked like it turned from going west to south it looked very bright and saucer like. I looked like it turned vertical or changed shape and disappeared. I don't know if this is related or what it was but last night same day I got off work late about 12pm I had been working all day. When I got home we played a few games then wound down to eat a late snack and we both heard a knocking on our living room window freaked us out I went out side with a tire iron and flash light and looked around the house nothing. The yard light was flashing off and on which I've never seen it do (Its one of those motion sensors with two flood lights) . It felt like a strong presence was there I got a bad headache and felt very uneasy like something was going to happen, What happened last night was even stranger and way scarier than the saucer like light we saw. I hope you don't think were crazy, I would take a lie detector test on this if I had to.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It flew almost all the way across the clear night horizon far too fast to be an aircraft or a satelitte, zig-zagged, then darted upwardMe, my brother and sister-in law were enjoying the clear night sky around a bon-fire at our hunting schack in central Minnesota, when we noticed a brighter star-like object very fast light moving across the sky from the west. When we noticed it, we knew it could not be an aircraft, as the speed it moved across the sky was just plain way too fast!! We weren't sure, and looked in the sky for another aircraft as a reference speed and found one. When we looked back, we noticed it had started to go from left to right in an upwards direction. It continued it's course eastward, then suddenly went upwards moving slightly towards the east much much faster than it moved across the sky, in a matter of seconds it was out of our eyesight. At that point, we realized it could not have been an aircraft, nor a satellite! My brother saw it again the next night, travel the same sort of path, at appoximately the same time. But we have never seen it again. We tried to rule out the possiblity of it being a non earth-like flying phenonmenon, but due to it's speed it moved across the sky and the fast back and forth manuevers it made, it was just not at all possible to determine it was of this earth. We realized there was no other alternative explaination. We still look for it whenever we are there. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This object had three long oval, light green lights on it. It was silent but could manuver VERY swiftly. It was an eerie and bit scary thing to observe. Is was almost stationary in one part of the sky. It left the sky at around 4:50 AM. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> strip of lights seen above neighborhoodMy brother and I were looking at the stars in my friend's backyard. I noticed a slow moving silent strip of lights (6 horizintal dim lights) , about 300 to 400 feet above us moving west. It was in the sky for about 30 seconds before moving out of view. Two minutes after discussing what it may have been (birds, plane, blimp) the object reapeared from the original direction where we had seen it before and followed the same path.

<b>DURATION:</b>  1-4 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Peculiar light streaks. Tonight I was rinsing my mouth with water/salt for my mouth sores, and I looked out my kitchen window which was on top the sink I retrieved the water from. At first glance, I saw a blinking light in non-stop motion. I thought of it being a low-altitude plane, yet the light was too small (giving the appearance of a high-altitude one) , plus at the given time, it was twilight, and I could not see the silhouette of the aircraft, which you would be able to normally. After witnessing the flash, I thought of the object being a meteorite. I looked back in curiosity, and I saw another quick streak of light shoot off in a different direction, near the point where the first light disappeared. I aroused suspicion, and watched the sky longer. The streak moved again, this time, heading westward, the opposite direction from which the first shot of light advanced. And about a second later, another flash ensued, going in the direction making a complete box if the light were to move continuously, without an intermission. Possibilities I assumed to which the lights could be were: A helicopter Fireworks Or meteorites falling coincidentally to form four 90 degree angles. Thank you for taking your time in reading this report, NUFORC. If anyone else in the Dakota County area has witnessed this event, please post a report as well. I am curious.

<b>DURATION:</b>  2 minutes (approx.)<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> dark diamond/clover shaped objects over Saint Paul at duskAround dusk, I was looking out the window of my apartment when I noticed some dark shapes floating in the sky. At first I assumed these were large soaring birds such as eagles or vultures, but as they moved across the sky from south to north, I could tell that they were too large and symmetrical to be birds, and that their movement was too even. As they passed by at their closest point to my view (directly to the east from my building) I was able to look at them with binoculars, and could make out what seemed to be 4 lobes, somewhat shaped like a compacted clover shape, which made an overall diamond silhouette with rounded corners. Given the lowering light, and that the objects were backlit against a brighter sky, I couldn't see any surface details. I called my wife in from another room, and she was able to see enough to realize that these weren't birds, or (commonly seen) aircraft. I counted 3 definite objects of this description, and a possible 4th as well. However, this 4th object I did not see until the group had traveled much further to the north, and had become too distant (small in perspective) to be sure it was of the same type. Of the 3 I have more certainty about, 2 were closer together, with the 3rd about double the distance again ahead and slightly above the others. The objects' movement was rather fast, but very smooth and silent and steady to the north. While the movement of these objects seemed somewhat balloon-like, the complex shape keeps me from any definite identification. I did some Google image searching for weather and radar balloons, but did not see anything remotely similar to what I saw in the sky. I also have not seen any other mention or explanation in the local media. I did not witness any lights, odd movement, or other classical "UFO" behavior from these objects, but they are flying objects that are unidentified nonetheless.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Light coming from "hyperspace" and slowing to a normal speed with absolutely no sound and observed for 3 minutesI live in a farming community in Minnesota. Our house sits one half mile off of a county road. I was walking our driveway tonight as I do several times a week. As I was heading east a sphere of light appeared to come in from "hyperspace" to a normal flying speed. It was heading west faster than an airplane, but slower than a jet. I would estimate my distance at about a half a mile away. I stopped to watch. There was no sound. Where our house is located is a flight path for the local airport. So I know that sound always "follows" an airplane. There was no sound ever. Then all of the local dogs in our area started barking. You can hear barking dogs from miles away. As the light started heading north, I kept looking for the light to change in intensity or disappear the way headlights would change on an airplane at different angles. I even tried to find blinking lights. There was never a change in the brightness of the light. The sphere remained the same intensity, as it was when I first saw it in the east "head-on. "I watched it head into the north until it disappeared into the clouds. Listening to the dogs barking farther and farther away. I am a veteran of the Air Force intel from 1974 - 1977. I held a top secret cryptologic/cryptographic clearance. [NUFORC Note: A flare from an Iridium satellite was visible in this area at 22:30 hrs. , and the ISS passed overhead at about the same time. We wonder if the time estimate above is accurate, or whether it might be an hour off. PD]<br>

It was solid in shape, it made no sound and had many lights on the bottom of it. Blue and white lights. It was very large, bigger then a house. It flew just over tree tops and seemed to move with such glide. It could not be seen after going over the tree's. We kept driving for maybe 20 seconds to reach a opening of the trees. When we reached a opening over a small lake they were gone. We had a good view of the sky now and there was nothing. they left as fast as they appeared.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  1-2 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw three white objects in clear blue sky flying against the wind in triangular formation. I was sitting in the back yard at my Girlfriend's house at 5:15 CDST in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. We had just returned from Hibbing, Minnesota where we were shopping. We were about to relax and have a drink. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the sky which was almost totally clear and blue, except for clouds near the horizon. Basically , it wa a totally clear sky, bright with sunlight. Windy. My girlfriend was checking on her flowers. I saw 3 white spots in the sky slightly southwest of vertical (toward Duluth) . I thought they might be fighter airplanes which do pass over at times. And I thought they could be white birds. However these objects were very, very high or at least appeared to be and I could not see any definition in the shape as you might with a bird or plane. My girlfriend thought they appeared triangular. At first sight these spots were in a straight line and proceeding to the Northwest by West. I thought I might have seen a tether, but I may have simply interpreted the regular in line motion as tethered. I was thinking of baloons. But the fact was I knew that the objects did not appear as baloons or aircraft or birds. The three spots were not shiny. They were dead white. They proceeded in a straight line as though on the wind. I think the wind was in the opposite direction. Very soon after first sight the objects moved in relation to each other, first appearing in the shape of an "L" with two fairly close together, almost touching. But as the movement went on the three objects took positions at the vertices of a perfect equalateral triangle. The triangle did not rotate. There was no sound. The motion was very steady as you see in a flight of birds. As the white spots moved more to the Northwest, they stopped. Abruptly. The motion seemed kind of chaotic at that point, but reorginized and then began moving more or less straight south. It was then that the spots disappeared. On first sight, with the objects in line, the appearance was quite different, but I would say the distance between the two outer objects or spots and the center was about the same as the distance between the points of the triangel shape later assumed. If the points were tied together, the changing shape might have been that of triangle being rotated so that I just saw it from a different angle. In the middle of this incident I got a cell phone call from my daughter about band practice. That distracted me as I tried to get her to go and look. I called the Duluth Air National Guard security service at 5:45, a half hour after the sighting because maybe they had it on radar. Of course, I didn't get any information and really, I was happy just to report what I saw. I am certain that the thing I saw was white. Dead white. Not shiny. It didn't change direction quickly although it may have been going very fast. It must have disappeared instantly. I don't know how high it was. Certainly higher than birds flying. And. . . I have never seen any thing like it and I have never made a report before. I am 67 years old.<br>

The object did not have any wings and appeared to be glowing a white radiant white light all around it even in broad daylight it was very bright. As it proceeded north it began to disapear slowly into the blue sky. I was watching commercial airliners all over during this time and this was not a airliner I am sure of that much. However it seemed to be about the same size as one but with no wings or markings. Airliners don't glow except when the sunlight is reflecting off of them. This was not the case however.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Streaking orange light made no sound at all. My family was on its way home from Lake City when we decided to stop at my wife's brother's house in Bellchester to say "hi, " since he didn't show for the family Thanksgiving. His house was dark and my wife decided to go herself to see if he was home while I waited in our minivan with our two young kids who are still in car seats. My oldest was sleeping and we didn't want to wake her up. I had shut off the headlights and was trying to figure out how to dim the radio lights when out of my peripheral vision, I saw what I thought was an airplane streak from my front left to front right, almost above my vehicle. This craft was flying very quickly at cloud level and could be seen in between two puffs of clouds on a partly cloudy night. I had only briefly locked into the object when it entered into another big cloud and that was all I saw. This happened very quickly, a second or two. At first it didn't register as anything unusual since my immediate focus was elsewhere. Since my wife was talking with her brother, I was able to think about what I had seen. I'd spent my first three years in the Army at Fort Bragg, next to Pope AFB, where a lot of F-16s, A-10s, and cargo planes such as the C-5 and then the new C-17 flew. I had spent some time at Seymour Johnson AFB guarding cargo next to its runway and had intimate understanding how loud F-15s were. When I was a kid growing up in Southern Wisconsin, C-130s flew over our house nap of the earth and so I knew how loud they were, what sound they made, and how much slower they were than fighter jets. I spent a lot of time in C-130s and C-141s at Bragg as well. What I realized was that at that low of an altitude and at that speed, the only thing it could have been was a fighter jet hauling butt. However, I know that fighter jets are not allowed to fly so low at those speeds over populated areas. It was much too fast to be a C-130 or similar type of aircraft. But the most distinctive fact that struck me, was that when this object flew over, it made no sound. Even in a minivan with engine running, the sound of a fighter jet going that fast that low would have been deafening. I would have just heard it approach before seeing it, and heard it even longer after it passed over. Instead, nothing at all. No sound. I then realized that I might have seen a UFO. I couldn't have been sure in the moment, but after analyzing all the facts, it couldn't have been any known aircraft. It wasn't a satellite because they don't fly under the clouds. I thought it might have been a meteor, but this flew at a straight horizontal path. I'm no meteor expert, but the ones I'd seen always came at some angle to the horizon, are usually higher up in the sky, and appear whitish, not the orange light I'd seen. If it were that close, wouldn't I have heard something? FYI, I spent 13 total years in the Army, about half on active and half in the Guard. I started as ranger qualified paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne (11B) and finished as a Signal Corps officer within V Corps with one tour in Iraq. I was with the 32nd Infantry BDE WIARNG between those two Active Duty stints. I am currently a small business owner in a small MN town and only talk about my UFO sightings with people I trust or if someone else admits they saw one, too. I saw my first UFO sighting as a young teen and posted that experience in the WI area. I grew up in a fundamental Christian home, so this is not something I'm suppose to believe in. However, I can't deny and can't explain what I've seen.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> three white circular objects in formationOn the afternoon of Labor Day, at around 3 or 4 in the afternoon, September 3, 2007, I was in the back yard of my parents&#39; home in North St. Paul, Minnesota. There was a clear blue sky overhead. Suddenly, my mother said, “Look, there&#39;s some hot air balloons. ” I looked but couldn&#39;t see anything. Then my brother said, “Oh, I see. But they can&#39;t be hot air balloons—they&#39;re too high up. ” He said he saw three white objects in formation. After looking for some time, I could finally make out one of the objects. The other two, said my brother, were hidden by a tree branch. I saw a tiny white speck in the sky. We talked for a while about what we saw and thought they might be weather balloons. But they were so high up, if they were weather balloons, they would be invisible at that height. And why would three weather balloons fly in formation? We made some jokes about UFO&#39;s and went back to eating our dinner. The sighting lasted approximately ten minutes.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright, white light moving towards east faded into red-orange color and disappeared. I was walking my dog and looked up into the clear night sky. I saw what looked to be a bright planet at first - A bright, white light. I then realized that the light was slowly moving to the east at a steady, slow pace. While still fairly high in the sky, the light dimmed, turned red-orange and then disappeared. No other aircraft or lights were visible in the area. The whole sighting lasted about 20-30 seonds.

<b>DURATION:</b>  10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I saw a disk hovering above some suburbs with a light shinning down below before disappearing in a streak of light. I am 24 and i live in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was in Minneapolis in July 1998 visiting my cousins with my parents. They live in suburbs of Minneapolis. One night around 1am i couldn't sleep because i was too hot, being from Scotland im not used to the heat! I got up to open a window but the problem was there was a mesh on the inside to stop mosquitos. I coludn't work out how to open it so was at the window for quite some time. It was then that i noticed a light in the corner of my eye. Looking out the window across the suburbs i could see a disk shaped craft hovering above a small clump of trees in the middle of the suburbs. It was about 500 yards away. It was clear to see because the house i was in was on a hill and the suburbs sloped away from it so there was nothing obstructing my view. I was almost looking slightly down on the craft. The craft was dark in colour, about 100 feet wide and thin from top to bottom, maybe only 10 or 15 feet. There were also small lights in the middle of the craft around its circumfrance. There was a green beam of light shinning from the middle of the underside of the craft down into the trees below. It was about 15-20 feet wide and panned out fractionaly futher from the craft. I watched it for about 10seconds or so then the light shut off. Without any noise the craft disappeared in a streak of orange light leading up to the right into the night sky. It was as if it had almost instantly accelerated to a speed hundreds of times faster than any plane, simply too fast to see. [NUFORC Note: Date of the event may be approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> orange/amberish orb sighted on the ground in the early morning hoursI was driving to work at 0420 and I was about a mile from home headed toward the south to St. Paul International Airport. I noticed this bright orange/amberish orb to my right, the west, in a field on the ground. I watched it as I drove by it for about a minute or two. It was about 15 feet in diameter. There were no apparent doors or windows seen. No blinking lights of any kind. I didn&#39;t hear any sound, but I believe I had my window rolled up. I didn&#39;t see any movement around it as I was watching for people or something to clarify what I was seeing. There was no one else on the road; it was very dark. For the next several mornings I watched the same area, but it did not reappear. If it was an aircraft I would have known as I grew up by Camp Ripley and used to watch the military jets and helicopters fly over day and night. I am also a private pilot and an A &amp; P mechanic so I am quite familiar with the majority of aircraft and their lighting.<br>

It was very close. It was silver-ish in color and had a brighter smaller center light. It hovered and moved about – nothing like anything we have ever seen. It did this for about a minute and then slowly moved off in a straight line. It was very cloudy that night so I knew it was flying low for us to be able to see it. We think it may have been attracted by the big baseball field lighting. My mother is 78 and I am the 9th of her 14 children and I am 46. We are white, middleclass.

It was brought to everyone's attention, but instead of looking, everyone thought it was probably just an airplane. As time went on, everyone slowly made their way to the window to take a look. Everyone agreed that there was no way it was an airplane because it wasn't moving. We thought it could be coming straight at us, but it NEVER came overhead, and it NEVER moved left or right. It couldn't have been a star either- because it was flashing VIVID white, green, red, and blue lights. Very bright! The figure also seemed to change shape. It was very high in the sky, but and looked as if it was hovering. We got out the binoculars to take a better look- and it at one point looked like a triangle, then like a circle. Then it started get smaller, like it was moving further away-still flashing (easily seen by the naked eye) bright vivid colors. Still no movement. Just size change, as it appeared to be flying directly away from us toward outer space. [NUFORC Note: Sighting of Sirius. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Point of Light type heavenly body in the eastern sky showed significant movement in various directions on the evening of Nov. 7. I was "naked eye" stargazing last night (11/07/07) , a perfect night for stargazing because of the stillness and clarity of the stars. I was looking eastward, paying special attention to the flickering stars. A speck of light in the mid-level eastern sky caught my eye because of the nature of its flickering. It appeared to be multi-colored, green, white, red, brighter flickers at times. There appeared to be an almost rotational aspect to the flickering. I began to watch it closely, primarily because of the fact that when I first laid eyes on it, I thought I detected movement. As I moved my position to be free of neighboring lights, I attempted to ascertain whether or not the object was moving. Using two objects in the sky which I was sure were stars, the object in question was in such a position with respect to the two stars that it formed an isoceles triangle. But then the object became aligned with the top-most of the two stars; minutes later it was aligned with the bottom star. I was convinced the object was moving, but so slowly as to be indiscernible. As I changed my position, I looked down at my feet for a moment, and when I returned my gaze to the object, it was no longer there. I looked southward of where I had been looking and I thought I detected it somewhat lower in the sky but the same flashing pattern was evident, so I thought I had re-detected it. I studied its location in the sky for a few minutes but could not detect any motion, and after awhile I went inside, it being quite chilly out and it was getting late. I personally feel this was the first time I've ever actually witnessed what I consider to be an authentic UFO, and I just turned 50!<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Low flying &amp; FAST object with lights moved across the sky- and then abruptly stopped and hovered for minutesMy husband and I were driving west on highway 62 from Minneapolis to Eden Prairie. We saw an aircraft traveling horizontally low in the sky very fast. We estimated that is was above Edina at the time. The aircraft was too low and too fast to be a typical airplane. Airplanes usually are not in that area of the sky. We travel this road daily and have never seen an airplane in that spot in the sky before. It was dark out so the exact shape was hard to determine but it seemed like a saucer with a row of lights toward the bottom. The saucer traveled north- northeast very fast, low in the sky, and then stopped abruptly and hovered. We watched it hover for several minutes as we traveled away from it. Eventually we couldn&#39;t see it any more because we kept driving. The size of the craft in the sky (from where we were on the ground) seemed a little bigger than a quarter but smaller than a tennis ball so we estimate that it was a couple miles away from us, somewhere in Edina perhaps.<br>

The night was very clear and I could see every star in the big dipper constellation, a testament to the clarity of the skies. I was looking Northward when from the right side of my vision (The East) , a black, triangular craft with one bright white light, about magnitude 2. 0, at each one of the three vertices of the triangle. The craft flew westward with a slight southern turn, it was completely silent throughout the duration of the flight. I observed it fly across the entire sky, from my point of view the object seemed to be two hundred feet long at least.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Flaming object seen over Minnesota SkyFlaming object seen over Minn. sky may have been meteor MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A flaming object over Minnesota skies this afternoon may have been a meteor. Shortly after 2 AM , people across the Twin Cities reported seeing a "metallic" object or "flaming ball" falling from the sky. Broadcasters and emergency dispatchers got hundreds of calls from people who saw the object traveling from the northeast to the southwest. The FAA received no reports of anything falling from any airplanes in the area, leading to speculation that it was a meteor that burned up in the atmosphere, since no crash site has been identified. Residents of Lyon County in far southwestern Minnesota reported a loud boom that might have been connected with the sightings in the Twin Cities. Navy reservist Greg Devereaux, who lives near the town of Amiret, says it shook his house and sounded like a sonic boom from an F-14 breaking the sound barrier at close range.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saucer shape in city of Cottage Grove, MN, seen for 5 minutesIt was in September weekend of 1979 and I was away on a fishing trip to northern minnesota, when I got home my wife said she had something to tell me and I shouldn&#39;t laugh at her. My wife is a strong german farm girl and not at all prone to making up tales. So she tells me that on Saturday evening she was coming home after visiting my folks. She was traveling east and she when topped the hill on 80th near the police station in Cottage Grove. She notices a saucer shaped object hovering over the houses off to the right or south. I questioned her about that part because there is a water tower about a ¼ mile east and south of the police station, but she said she could clearly see the water tower and the ufo was closer to her and further south a little. She said she watched it til she came abreast of it and continued on towards home feeling spooked and not wanting to stop with our three kids sleeping in the back seat. When she got to keats ave about a mile or so further east she did stop the car and got out to look at it, as it was still in approximately the same position. So she had watched it for about 5 minutes and was as close to it as a half a city block. So our kids are grown up and married and my oldest girl and her husband were over for supper one night many years later. He started telling us a story about his 13th birthday party and how a tiny object no bigger than a foot in diameter flew right between him and a friend while they were playing in the yard My son-in-law lived right about where my wife saw the ufo and it was the same weekend in Sept. 1979 We have thought about filing a report or calling the police but not wanting to get the notoriety. My wife describes it as about 30-40 ft in diameter and about 8-10 ft tall at the center, she says this because she thought that it was as wide as the houses under it. She says it was about 50 ft in the air. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Light<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  Hour and a half<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> UFO lights over Minnesota River in Burnsville that resemble the Phoenix lights. I am a female and I'm 26 years old. My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old. I have seen UFO's before, but nothing like this. It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I'm so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn't see the UFO's any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO's and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were. The UFO's were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That's my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white. I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O's were n't as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO's didn't move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it's size, but then the lights weren't flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO's, the one in the middle drifted off and did it's own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn't come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn't get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO's appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P. S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality. P. S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half. From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Orange points of light racing South from Perseus at great speed and altitude slowing, speeding, passing each other. I was out observing Comet 17p/Holmes, again. I spotted it again tonight and it is a bit fainter maybe magnitude 3 now also more dispersed. Look in the East (just North of East really) find Cassiopeia above the area Capella, the brightest star in the East, below and the seven sisters (Plieades - a little tiny dipper) to the South, in the middle between all those is an equilateral triangle of close to the same magnitude stars -the fuzzy dirtball is on the lower left- obviously hazy through binoculars. I just witnessed my first UFOs these two lights passed near the comet at an apparent altitude similar to the ISS/Space-Shuttle (which I saw a couple nights ago) silent, orange color points of light and chasing, slowing, speeding, passing- speeds that ranged from faster than ISS to full stopped on a dime and then 90 degree instant turns East and gone. This was unlike any heavenly body not even meteors move like this. Human's Jets could not move with such speed especially in the turning, no Earthly flight technology can slow down like these did. I cannot rule out plasmas but plasma still has to follow the rules of physics regarding inertia, energy conservation and acceleration. I followed these with my binoculars for perhaps half to three-fourths of a minute. The initial direction was South out of Perseus away from the comet when I first noticed them. I have no explanation for these 2 things.<br>

It was as high as the water tower, and the only thing that can move that fast is a prop engine or faster. It was completely silent and had no lights on it. it was a large v-shape and right behind it was a smaller v. It almost looked like it was trying to disguise itself as a flock of white birds. Birds cannot fly this fast or glide that fast. I estimate its speed as fast as the top speed of a Cesna aircraft. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ It was in that formation, and moved as if it were one.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two spheres flying in tight formation near Ford Parkway bridgeOn June 16th 2006, my wife and I were sitting outdoors at a café, the clouds looked particularly interesting that day, and as I often photograph them for my projects, I asked her if she minded us making a quick stop at the Ford Parkway bridge. This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds. I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife&#39;s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car. We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky. When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other. They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless. I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective. I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon. From the time I spotted them to the time they reached the Eastern horizon was less then a minute.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright pulsating light over lake superior. Location of sighting was on the hillside of East Duluth overlooking lake superior towards the southeast. My roomate was having a cigarette out on the porch when he noticed an unusually bright star in the sky above the lake. He came and got me and i grabbed a pair of binoculars. To the naked eye, it appeared to be flashing. upon closer inspection through the binoculars, i could see that the light was flashing/pulsating different colors. It had a uniform sperical shape to it. at this point we were making various conclusions as to what it was. my other roomate dylan seemed convinced that it was a plane, but i was not so sure. it did not seem to be moving. the object remained stationary for some time (5 min) as we watched. It became brighter and slowly began moving to the right (Southwest) , and proceeded to move behind a small patch of trees which were blocking our vision. the object emerged from behind the trees and was moving noticibly faster and it seemed closer. the object proceeded towards the right and began ascending upward at which point it went up into the overcast. although we did observe the object from a distance, somewhere between 4-5 miles, i am quite convinced that this object was not a helicopter or plane. i was so startled by what i had seen that I went online to try to figure out what to do, who to report it too, etc. . . that i how i stumbled upon your website. thank you for giving people the opportunity to go somewhere with these sightings. more attention needs to be paid to the subject of UFOs because what i saw was definitley unlike anything i have ever seen in the sky.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> brilliant multicolored cloudshaped entity (a pulsing cloud of beaming color) In the summer, many years ago, I was traveling with three other friends and noticed 2 very unusual clouds. It was about the year I graduated, 74, 75 We moved west to get a better look and eventually came to park almost directly beneath one. The clouds where about 2 miles apart. The other quit a bit west yet. They moved very slowly to the south and stopped. They were amazing. The only thing I&#39;ve ever seen like them is the northern lights. The center was one color then another band of color towards the edge or circumfrance and an occasional third band of color would come and go. The clouds “pulsed” just like the northern lights from the center with thin sharp protrusions somewhat like a spinyfish or sea urchin. They were more flat and plate like than high and fluffy I quess they were about an eight to a quarter mile in diameter. They resembled the spin art pictures people often do at county fairs. Yet very sharp and defined. We got out of the car and laid on the ground for over an hour. We finally became board and went on our way. I have seen some amazing northern light over my 50 years. Many colors, many shapes and sizes. One night the whole sky from horizon to horizon and moving rapidly in waves. Breathtaking.! The police talkied about it all night on the radio. That was in the early 1980&#39;s. But these clouds were in the middle of the day. I think about 1pm or 2pm Very vivid and full like a single rain cloud but pulsing from the center and with very vivid colors. Deep clear color. I don&#39;t recall any normal clouds in the sky at all. Its been years and I really don&#39;t remember all the details. I have never seen them since, nor have I ever heard of anyone else seeing them besides the people with me. I may still be able to contact two of the others that were with me. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Fireball<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  3 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> white fireball seen falling Jan. 14, 2008 in north central MinnesotaOn January 14, 2008, about 8:10 AM , I was chatting on the phone facing my eastern windows. I suddenly saw a bright, white fireball in the sky. I ran to the window and watched it fall for a couple of seconds before it disappeared behind the trees. It was bright white and appeared to be on fire. The moving flames were white hot, however, not orange, yellow, or red. I felt no thud of impact, heard no sounds, nor saw flames of an explosion. I ran to my car and drove east along our road to check the neighbors' homes for flames or evidence of a crash site where a small plane may have crashed. I was basically looking for flames. Finding nothing, I hurried home and called 911 to report what I'd seen to the Crow Wing County Sheriff's office. After discussing it with the dispatcher, I jumped on a snowmobile and looked for signs of an aircraft crash out on the lake ice, finding nothing. A short time later I received a call from the investigator from the sheriff's office who had just checked Northgate Lane, further to the east. He, too, found nothing, and we concluded that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, and that I might have seen a meteorite. It was only tonight that someone told me there had been other sightings on that same evening in Texas, so for what it's worth, I am submitting my report.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Unusual light over the Boundry WatersWhile on a solo wilderness camping trip in the Boundry Water Canoe Area west of Ely, Minnesota I was at the edge of Cummings Lake observing the clear night sky. I saw a few satellites and a couple of meteors among the stars. I then saw a dim red light above the trees some distance away. The light was small, steady, a deep cardinal red, moving slowly in a horizontal fashion over the big lake. The light quickly rose in altitude and began a "ballet" of arcing turns and curved trajectories, appearing to approach closer then retreat farther away. The speed varied from almost static to a blur. I noticed the light being reflected on the lakes surface at one point. The only sounds were those of frogs, toads, loons and birds. The light might have been a large object some distance away, or a smaller object relatively close to me. . . it was difficult to tell because it never flew below the tree line to provide a scale of size or proximity. The show lasted about three minutes. I related my observation to a party of other campers a few days later who were exiting from the north. They too stated that they had seen the unusual red light. Aircraft are prohibited from overflying this large wilderness area. [NUFORC Note: Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A bluish/green sphere dropped out of the sky and was observed at two different locations 65 miles apart. On Feb. 21 @ 20:39 (CST) I observed a bluish/green sphere shaped object dropping out of the evening sky. The object left a very minimal trail of sparks behind it as it dropped. Its size was like a nickel held at arms length away from the body. From my location in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, it was dropping at a 10 degree angle going from east to west. It disappeared into the trees approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. At the point it disappeared into the horizon the object was 15 degrees East of South. I mentioned this occurrence to an acquaintance who lives in Grand Rapids, Minnesota the next day and he and his wife observed the same event. They observed the same color object which was falling straight down to earth on a line from Grand Rapids to Ironwood, Michigan, and disappearing into the trees before hitting the horizon. Could this have been a piece of the satellite that was shot down a day earlier?[NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally credible witness.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw bright lights, changing in color over South Chain Lake into backyardMy fiancé and I were driving north on Interstate 35W. We decided to stop at my folks place on South Chain Lake. It was around 11:15pm or so. The weather was windy and cold with some light snow. My folks were out of town so I was checking in on the house periodically. My fiancé wanted to check the baseball scores so he went downstairs to use the computer. I was upstairs making a late-night snack in the kitchen. About that time I was startled by bright lights in the backyard towards the lake. It was so bright I thought a helicopter was shining lights down but there was no noise. The brightness quickly reduced and turned into a blue-hued light shining into the house. At this point I fainted and my fiancé, Dwight, heard me hit the floor. He came running upstairs to find me lying on my side by the sliding glass door (I must have gone over to look out the window) . He says he saw no lights and nothing outside. We went outside and there were two parallel tracks coming up from lake shore to the middle of yard, almost like car tracks but they were smooth. The odd thing is I seemed to have no injury from when I fainted, and this all seemed to take place in under a minute, but Dwight swears he was on computer for 10 or more minutes. I felt I had to tell my story somewhere. I never really believed in UFO&#39;s previously, but I&#39;ve been having nightmares about it for 5 days now and have had a couple of flashbacks. Also, my dreams include seeing a hovering globe or sphere-shaped craft and I feel weightless, like I&#39;m always falling.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Circling Shiny ObjectsAbout 6pm, my husband and 2 kids were in our back yard and looked up to see what looked like a bird circling at a very high altitude, only it looked metallic. It was very high and appeared to be circular or possibly a cylinder shape. We were facing east and the sun was behind us. It was still daylight with a clear blue sky. The object appeared to be reflecting the sun as its light varied as it moved in its circular path. It seemed that at certain points in the circle it was at a better angle for reflecting the sun. It was making circles and moving north, then it faded away for a while or moved too far away to see, then it returned and circled around some more. At the time airplanes were landing in a path from Lake Harriet, southeast toward the airport. The planes were crossing under the area where these objects appeared to be circling, so they were very high up. After about 10 minutes, we saw two identical lights circling in the same pattern in unison, again moving northward, then fading away, then returning to the same spot due east. We watched until they faded away again then went inside. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> bright light moved erratically across minnesota skyI was lying in a field star gazing with a date; we were looking for shooting stars and saw a few throughout the night. In the corner of my eye I saw a light appear, thinking it was a shooting star I turned and looked. It was in the southern sky on a clear night, I quickly focused my eyes on the light. Immediately I came to the conclusion that the light wasn't a shooting star but rather something else. The light grew brighter for about 3 to 4 seconds, resembling a car light coming closer. The light was not very large; it started about the size of a star and grew brighter. I asked my date what she thought the growing light could be, she was uncertain but was quick to believe it must be an airplane. I too thought it might be an airplane because that would be the most logical explanation. Once the light stopped growing brighter it was motionless for a split second and then began to move from right to left in the sky. It started on a straight course, which made me think it really was a plane or satellite but then the light began to shuffle up and down. Moving unlike anything I have seen before. Immediately when it began moving up and down I told my date it was a UFO. I asked her, isn't that a UFO? She was very scarred and reluctant to admit something like that, but once she saw the light move in the way it did she too said it must be unidentified flying object. It moved across the sky fast, moving oddly for about 4 seconds the light vanished into the sky. It seemed to disappear from the sky with no trace of it ever being there.

Why I'm writing this is to see if anybody else saw what I did. Heretofor: Two objects orange in color, round, and moving very fast as if chasing each other were moving east to west towards the Mississippi river. I couldn't believe what I saw and ran in to tell my then girlfriend what I just witnessed. After talking with her I went back out and looked in the direction that they flew and 9 objects were coming from west to east in exactly the same fashion and probably the same level in the sky. They were in two groups. . . One was 5 and following were 4 objects. . They were all moving around each other as if to be playing tag of sorts. . Then at an angle of about 15 degrees they all came together to form one complete ball and at a 60 to 80 degree angle they flew much faster and went out of sight. . . . Nothing was reported that I know of to any paper or other reporting agency the following day. . . I know what I saw wasn't a plane because the next day I stood in the exact same spot and saw an airplane moving in approximately the same direction and it wasn't anywhere near as fast. The time the moved from east to west and then again from west to east was each about 3 to 5 seconds. . . [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Multiple ufos with unusual lights over Cottage Grove, MNThis sighting is very, very similar to one I just found from the same area in 2003, it can be found here: http://www. nuforc. org/webreports/030/S30323. html Me and 2 of my friends (we are all from St. Paul) drove out to Cottage Grove to hang out with a few friends of ours. We were playing basketball in the driveway of their house for about an hour, and people began to leave. We were about to go inside when I noticed an object moving through the sky. It looked like a large satellite, and it was moving at a constant speed. Being a pretty big ufo enthusiast myself, I pointed it out and we all started watching it. It soon started to make wobbles and turns that no satellite or aircraft could have made (it was way too high up to be a plane) . I was wondering if it was my eyes playing tricks on me when it completely stopped in the middle of the sky. It hovered in one spot for about 40 seconds, and in that time it grew extremely bright. At that point we all knew it was no satellite we were looking at. The object started moving again and flew into the distance. There were 5 of us watching it by now, and we called another person who lived down the block to come outside and see what was going on. We soon saw another object in the sky, and very faint, smaller dots appeared around it. The dots shot off in different directions, some moving extremely fast and some slower. One big dot stayed stationary. As we watched these dots (especially the big one) they began to change colors and it almost looked like they would split into 2 dots and then reassemble. One of the people I was with saw a red object leave the biggest dot and shoot towards the ground. All of us saw very faint shooting star-like objects flying by the area of the biggest dot. A HUGE orange object soon flew through a small area of the sky in a very shooting star-like motion, and we all saw it. At this point there were six of us and we decided to get in the car and drive about a half mile away to a place where there was less light and more open space to watch. We relocated to a parking lot with a field next to it, and we watched the objects that were still in the air. We saw some movement but not as much as before. We noticed that in the far corners of the sky there were flashing dots. Pretty much every direction you turned you were able to see something in the sky. Then, the big one. My friend went around to the other side of the building we were parked by to pee. He saw something in the sky and called all of us over. It was an object hovering in the air with extremely unusual lights. This one was much, much closer than any of the other things we had seen, and was actually only about a hundred feet from the ground from what it looked like. We ran over and watched it as it started moving one way, completely changed directions, and then completely turned around again. It flashed extremely brightly at least 3 times and then began to display very different patterns of lights. It almost could have been mistaken for a plane's lights at one point, but the lights kept changing and the object was moving very strangely. It disappeared over the treeline. After this object we saw 3-4 plane-like objects move overhead, about 5 minutes apart from each other. They all came from the same direction, all were silent, and all of them headed in the same direction towards the first object we saw. They had blinking white and red lights on them but the amount of lights and the speed they were traveling was unusual. Me and a friend saw one final object, WITH blinking red and white lights, fly in the same direction. We thought it could be a plane but I watched it carefully just in case. When it passed where we were standing it began to move up and down as it was flying, making weird movements that planes do not make. Overall the entire experience lasted about 2-2 1/2 hours. These were definite UFOs, we all saw them. It was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen before, and the same goes for the 5 credible witnesses I was with. I'm sure other people saw these also, as some of these objects were not subtle at all. Again, these objects moved in ways planes cannot, in erratic, jerky movements. However, they were definitely under some kind of intelligent control, as some seemed to interact with each other. Each of the 5 people I was with will tell the exact same story if asked, and we all saw what we saw.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Small white cigar shaped object, low in sky, hovered for 2 minutes, then disappeared, no trail. Two friends and I were golfing on the 10th hole at North Links golf course, and there was clear blue sky. As we looked forward into the sky, one of us noticed a white, cigar or tampon shaped object sitting in the sky, no wings, obviously not a plane or helicopter, and there was no smoke or jetstream coming from the object. It was probably about 500 yards or so away in the sky. We sat stunned, asking each other, " what could that possibly be, besides a UFO. " No one wanted to tee off, because we wanted to wait to see what happened with the foreign craft. After about 2 minutes, the craft gradually got smaller for about 10 seconds, and then completely disapppeared like it went into stealth mode, again, no smoke or anything, it just vanished. Within minutes of seeing the craft, a small army type plane was flying in the same general area where we had seen the craft. We kept looking for the next two hours of golf, but no reappearance occurred. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

It was intense enough to light the street up as well due to the water on the roadway. it had the exact same appearance in intensity and height as a radio or water tower mounted with a red light would on such a hazy night. However I know the area well. There is no such tower in the area, just a farm field, so this light which made no noise is unexplainable. after 3-4 min it began to fluctuate and dim until it disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It was a clear night and there were 3 objects in the sky that 8 people seen. On May 25 at around 11pm, recieved a phone call from my boyfriend saying that he is watching something in the sky and I would not believe him if he told me what he thought it was. Curious I drove out to his location and he then pointed out what he was seeing. The object in the sky was bright and blinking many different colors. When it was not blinking it blended into the sky like a star. After about 3 min. of watching this object it now had started moving up, down, right, left and diagonal. He had told me it was moving earlier also. After looking at it for 10 min. I stoped looking at it so my eyes would adjust and I would know it was not just an optical elusion. We then looked around in the sky to see if there was others. There was 3 total. They would light up very bright then get dim. They would move in all sorts of directions. They also had something in common with each other, they all blinked many different colors, they moved in weird ways and 2 of them stayed inbetween 2 stars. The other was the most active and got very bright then dim. The object also moved in every direction and fast. The object started out about 50 degrees up from the ground. It would then drop to about 25-30 degrees then back up. That's not it. After awhile I had though my eyes were playing tricks on me until a plane that was flying at the same altitude and directly towards the object came about. It seemed to effect the object. The plane stayed at the same speed and altitude. As the plane got closer the object started lighting up like a strobe light of colors and shot straight at the plane. It then bobbed up and down. After the plane passed it then moved up to about 60 degrees in the sky. The objects went on lighting up for about 2 and a half hours till' we needed to go home. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I know what a plane looks like in the sky and also a satilite. This was not either one. There was 8 people total that seen this in our town. 6 that were with us. My boyfriend, boyfriend's mother, his 2 of his best friends, my brother and me. The other two were passing us in the road and stopped to see what we were doing. One was the ensurance agent for our town and his son. It almost made me sick when I seen these objects. Tomorow we are going out to see if they are there again. I will write again if they are. [NUFORC Note: Twinkling star?? PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two bright white lights that stopped in midair and disappeared over the horizon within secondsThe summer of 1962, my girlfriend (high school - 17 years old) and I were at a friends cabin on Big Kandiyohi Lake. We were sitting on the cabin steps (dark out) , when we saw a bright light shooting out of the sky. It was very bright, but had no trailing debris like a "falling star" has. We thought it was that at first, but then it stopped in mid air. It looked like a couple thousand feet above the lake and close to the middle. It sat there for about 2 seconds and then another light shot down and stopped parallel to it. They sat side by side for a second or so (no noise) and then both of the lights took off at the same time (side by side) and disappeared over the horizon at a high rate of speed. They disappeared in about a second. The light was bright white, like a halogen light is today. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate. PD]<br>

The rear light was gaining on the other two and I followed them until I lost them in the northern hemisphere. They were traveling faster than anything we have flying today and all three were steady, bright lights, as bright as the stars in the background. I got nervous when I first seen them, not frightened but shocked. These were not of this Earth and were Aliens. This is the second time I've seen U. F. O. 's over Lake Superior. The last time was a single bright light and this time there were three. There was no sound in either case!<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Fireworks and then flying objects with lightsWe went to Excelsior MN to watch fire works and had a great view sitting on the beach. The fire works had ended and we started to gather our belongings, when someone said look and they were pointing to the sky. In the sky you could see objects that where flying south to north with four lights on each object. The lights appeared to be moving on the object in a circular motion. The color of lights would vary from Red, Blue, Green and White, but on each object the color of the light would always stay the same. If it was Red it would remain red. I believe there were about 30 objects that went past us. They just kept coming and coming. The objects would fly close together and in groups then just disappear. I can't believe planes can fly that close together and that many flying at a time. It was the strangest sighting I have ever seen. I grabbed my sister-in-law. It freaked us out. We had a group of 14 people on the beach with us, but there where a lot of people around us, remember the fire works had just ended. Our group contained people from 45 to 2 years old, and even my 5 year old talks about this event. I truly wish someone had a video camera to video this.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Formation of 10 to 12 square shaped objects observed over Excelsior, MNJuly 4, 2008 10:35 Central Time Large formation of square objects observed over Excelsior, MN, moving from southern horizon to the north straight overhead. Objects had four white lights on each corner which gave the appearance that they were square shaped. Objects seemed to be very high in altitude, perhaps in Earths orbit. Some were in pairs or groups of 3 and 4 and would rapidly change position in their formation. Objects disappeared when they got directly overhead. Altogether, there were approximately 10 to 12 objects total. This event happened at 2235 local time and lasted about 5 minutes. This was after the July 4 fireworks show on the lake. There were thousands of people out there. We were on a boat and there were many witnesses. The fact that the objects were changing positions in their formation proves to me that they were not satellites. And they were not aircraft as I know them. I am an airline pilot and amateur astronomer and feel that I know what is not normal in the sky. I have seen many strange things at night in the sky but have always been able to find an explanation.

As soon as that thought crossed my mind it looked as though the object turned and the color faded from bright yellow to a QUICKLY fading orange color and continued to fade as it traveled northeast until it completely disappeared. This all happened in about 5 seconds. I have lived in Chaska for about 10-months and am very familiar with the night sky as far as planet locations and star formations and that's why I was caught off guard when I saw this light as it seemed out of the ordinary.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A brilliant white light traveling over Lake Superior north to northeast. I was lying on my couch watching a TV program when a light caught my eye, through our picture window. A very bright and constant light, like a white-hot ball, slowly moved through the night skies. It made its way north, from over lake Superior, and slowly arced northeast in direction. At one point, it seemed to slow a bit and then gradually and effortlessly gained speed. There was no sound and I made notice of the object to another person walking by. The person thought it must be just a plane, but there were no normal signs of it being any kind of plane, helicopter, or ultra-light vehicle. . . such as; wing tip lights of green or red, no under belly light, no tail light and no sound. This was not a plane. I have known “man-made” aircraft/planes since I was a child. My family was a member of EAA and we went to the EAA Fly-in in Oshkosh, WI every summer for 18years.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Lime green orb of light seen descending in Brooklyn Park, MN by multiple partiesI am reporting this not as a witness but as an investigator in to this strange occurrence. My brother and five friends were traveling in a car when they saw an intensely lit lime green spherical orb descend from a cloud in the Eastern sky. My brother the driver was first to see the object and quickly pointed it out to the passengers. They all claim that the object moved from a point high above a cloud to a position at the same level as the cloud where the orb then disappeared. It moved at a speed possibly 2 to 3 times that of a commercial airliner and was slightly smaller than the size of the moon in the sky. They also claim that the orb had a sort of haze around it for the entire five seconds that the orb existed. My friend who was a passenger in the car called two of his buddies afterwards who also saw the same orb from about . 35 miles NE of their position at Super America at 93rd Ave and Zane Ave. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

<b>DURATION:</b>  4 min<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large trinagular craft spotted over Mpls, MN in 1975In either late '75 or early (jan-mar) '76 my husband and I were driving through a neighborhood known as North Minneapolis. I was in the passenger seat. My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed "What the hell is that?". He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward. When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft. it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction. While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it. I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom. I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth. It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound. As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour. I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity. We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car. He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us. I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone. I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished. We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi. I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen. He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw. He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene. I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included. I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night. I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright red lights moving in steady progressionWe were working night shift at Paper mill. 1 guy mentioned on the radio that there was some red lights in the sky. I was with a co worker in the pick-up truck and got out to look. We saw about 7 red lights in a triangle shape traveling from west to east moving towards Duluth. There was 2 sets of 3 lights in the back with a somewhat larger light in the front. All the lights were moving together, although I couldn't tell if it was one large object. If it was one object, IT WAS HUGE. My coworker said there was a low pitched noise but it wasn't loud like a jet or something. I know these were not airplane lights, (I used to work avionics for a local airplane manufacturer) . These lights moved in a steady progression and we watched it until the lights faded to the east. I also saw what looked like a streak of light shoot from the object, which looked like a shooting star. These lights were not blurry but quite bright and crisp. The night was clear and I dont think the moon was out; so it was dark.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Intense light seen in Northern Minnesota's back country skies. Myself and two of my friends were camping in Voyageurs National Park in Northern Minnesota for a couple nights of camping and fishing. We were camping on an island just a few hundred yards from the Canadian border and were enjoying a campfire on Thursday night the 31st. It was so clear out and the stars were so bright we decided to walk out to the point and star gaze for awhile. As we're standing there just looking at the stars one of my frineds points out a satellite moving across the sky. We all look at it and confirm to each other that, yes, it's a satellite. No blinking lights, just a solid white light in the sky that looked like a moving star, like most satellites look from earth. Within a couple seconds the "satellite" zooms incredibly close and an incredibly bright light shines down. I wouldn't necessarily call it a "beam" of light, just this intense bright white light. It shown on us for maybe two-three seconds and then turned off and as soon as it turned off it looked like the tiny little light of a satellite again, but moving much faster and within a few seconds was out of sight. There was not a sound at all and never saw it's shape or anything, just the light. My friend said he didn't think it zoomed down to us, but rather just became this intense light. I, on the other hand, felt that it came down close because it wasn't a super intense little spec of light, it was close enough that the light appeared to be a foot or two across. So distance is still a little hard to describe and me and my friends all have different thoughts on how close it was. Whatever this was it moved across the sky from the US into Canada. As soon as this all happened we looked at each other and started laughing because these things don't happen to us. This only happens in the movies kind of thing. One of my friends immediately says, "there's many explanations for what we just saw. " But he couldn't come up with one single explanation and agreed that what we saw was very strange and defini! tely uni dentified. I am a 31 year old College Grad. , and work as a Purchasing manager for a lumber company. I have never seen anything like this before in my life, nor either of my friends. We all agreed to not tell anyone about this because who's going to believe us, right? Off course we had to tell somebody, so we ended up telling our frineds and family and off course almost every one of them asked what we were smoking that night. I guess that's the response we thought we'd get.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The time of night was close to 12:05 am August 31, 2008. From my kitchen window facing north I saw a object cross from from my right to left going in a northwesterly direction, it was about dime size at arms length, perfectly round in shape. Using a protractor it was 30 degrees up from level when first seen, from there it traveled in a curve downward till it disappeared behind the tree line. Time seen was about 3 seconds, of the 180 degrees of sky from right to left my view of it was only about 45 degrees. When first seen it was straight north and then disappeared to the northwest 45 degrees later behind the tree line. To me it seemed close, a few miles or so. I could not tell if it was self illuminating or from friction, there was no debris trail, the color was bright white with a reddish fringe around the perimeter.<br>

It was likely just somewhere over the border in Canada when we first spotted it. After four or five seconds of tracking it and confirming with each other that we both saw the same thing, the amber light, to our utter shock, turned 45 to 50 degrees to the west and disappeared. The arc its turn made was solid and geometrically clean. Its luminosity lay somewhere between that of the brightest stars in the sky and the dimmest.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Small, bright-white light disappears into another larger, diffuse light (at sunset) . I am writing to you today to document what happened to me as a child (about 14yr of age) . It was a mostly sunny and warm day in summer. I climbed onto the top of my Dad's camper and was lying on my back, watching the sunset. I noticed a small, bright, white, light moving west to east across the sky at a mediun, steady pace. Within seconds, a second light appeared to the east of, and slightly above, the first. This light was round and white, but many times larger than the first, and diffuse. The first light continued moving east until it was directly below the second. There was a brief hesitation, then the first light shot straight up into the second. When the two lights came together, they both instantly disappeared.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 Seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Silent, black, triangular object with no lightsI remember it as being roughly a week or so before Halloween of 2007. My friend and I were grounds workers at a mining museum/park, and we had just finished closing up the park and locking the buildings around the site. We locked up our grounds garage last, where our cars were parked, at about 6:00 PM. We ended up getting into a conversation for about 45 minutes. The sun had set, and we were having a deep discussion about 80&#39;s Hip-Hop artists, when my friend suddenly stopped talking, looked up, startled… and then SPRINTED up the road about 20 feet! I wasn&#39;t too concerned, just a little confused. I caught up with him and he explained to me that he had just seen a very large triangular “object” pass right over us, and just over the tops of the trees near us. He described it as being INCREDIBLY low, probably just 75-100 feet off the ground, triangular, and black. I couldn&#39;t help but be skeptical of his account, being as I sensed absolutely nothing of this seemingly huge UFO right above our heads. We were all by ourselves, there was virtually no ambient noise down by our garage, except the sound of cars passing by on the highway near us, and still this “craft” made absolutely no noise whatsoever. So I stood there for a while and listened to my friend frantically repeat his description for about two minutes. I clearly remember him estimating the size of it and whatnot, when I looked up to the north, pointed at something, and yelled “Like THAT?!” I felt my stomach drop. He looked and said “Yes!” I stared directly at it. It was a black triangle, floating slowly upwards. It wasn&#39;t as close to the ground as what my friend described, and its really hard for me to guess how big it was, but I would estimate it as being roughly the same size as the one he witnessed first. All I can remember is how directly I was staring at this thing… it was a totally clear night, the thing was darker than the sky, and I had no doubt about the exact shape I was looking at. It was just a triangle… no lights, just a shape… slowly moving upwards. We watched it for what could not have been more than 5 seconds, and it just vanished right in front of our eyes… just disappeared. I proceeded to freak out and scream a string of profanity, all while we tried to reason and deduce what we realistically could have seen. “Things can&#39;t just disappear!” We ended up jumping in our cars and driving across the street to the &#39;Ironman&#39; statue/parking lot. We got out of our cars and stood there for quite a while, staring up at the sky, almost expecting to see another one. I imagine we looked pretty insane like that, but it didn&#39;t really concern us as much as seeing disappearing triangle spaceships… I&#39;m not sure how long we stood there, but I swear it was almost 9:00 by the time we decided that we had no idea what it could have possibly been, and it was time to go home. My drive home was about 15 minutes, and I&#39;d be lying if I said it wasn&#39;t an immensely unsettling drive home. I found myself staring up out my window the whole ride, but genuinely not wanting to. I never really believed in paranormal activities and the like… I&#39;d never seen a ghost or alien or UFO or anything like that, and I always remember seeing UFO accounts on TV and being very skeptical. I always thought “I&#39;m doubt they could see anything clearly if it was that dark. “ But what I saw was so clear, and I have no doubt about exactly what we both saw, which I think was actually the part that made me the most uncomfortable. The following weeks I just felt sick, scared, paranoid and uncertain. I told very few people about it. Over the course of the next months, and the rest of the winter, there was more slight… anomalies. One strange night at around 10:00 PM (again at our workplace) , we were in the museum parking lot, looking at the sky and we saw a strange, moving star-like light up in the sky. Naturally we assumed it was another plane, but it was moving it an erratic, arbitrary pattern that was just odd. We watched for minutes as it just moved across almost the whole sky, heading towards the horizon (which happened to be the general direction of the airport…) , when two other lights appeared. We heard distant rotors and decided these ones were helicopters. The helicopters seemed to follow (or chase) the first light, until they all disappeared behind the horizon. Another time my friend called me at 5:45 AM, and I didn&#39;t answer. He left me a message telling me to turn on the news. I did, and saw video from the airport cam of three strange, dim lights in a triangular pattern right on top of the horizon. They (or “it”) weren&#39;t moving relative to the surroundings, though when we replayed the DVR in slow-motion, we could see the lights “fluctuating”. There has been several times where we or I have just looked up and seen a “star” moving in the same strange, erratic patterns, or just general strange stuff going on. And the weird thing is, its always only happened at work. I&#39;ve thought about trying to get a picture or video sometime, but haven&#39;t yet. I still work there, and it&#39;s almost a normal thing now for strange things to happen. But I have to be honest, it still bothers me deeply not knowing for sure. I always expect to go outside for a cigarette one night and see something else. Airplanes can&#39;t disappear. (NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Lights at night, shining into car and garage and around blindsWas at my niece's house, out in the south area of North Branch, MN. They live north of Stacy and South of North Branch proper, approximately half-way between. Just a mile or so east of Highway 35. They live out in the country. Woke up sometime during early morning hours on Oct 10, 2008 or late Oct 9, 2008. Around the edges of my front window blinds seemed very light and I thought it was morning. I looked at the blinds from bed for a minute or so. I fell back asleep, woke up some time later to see that all was dark outside, so it was obviously not morning. Looked out my side window blind to see one patch of what looked like fog about 50 ft away in the brush. I was curious about the light I had seen earlier, so I peeked out the front blinds. Saw a single bright diamond-shaped light suspended about 10 ft above my car, shining inside the front windshield. I watched it for about 30 seconds. Couldn't tell if there was any object there as my niece's garage was blocking my view where I couldn't see anything else but the light. I got up and walked in the dark to the large windows upstairs, but the light was gone. I went down to the front door and noticed light coming out from around the door that leads into the garage. The garage door seemed to be moving or making noise. I was frightened so ran back down into my bedroom and locked the door. Was able to eventually go back to sleep - not believing this incident was real I guess. I swear I was awake through all of this. I asked my nephew-in-law the next morning if they have motion-sensor lights on their garage; they don't. He said he was up during the night but if I remember right he said he had not been in the garage.<br>

I saw it while I was laying in the front yard stargazing, I was hoping to see a shooting star so I had my eyes open for any movement in the sky, I saw a few airplanes, and then the UFO. I KNOW it wasn't an airplane because I had already seen those. It stayed in the sky moving north for about six to eight seconds before disappearing near the constellation Cassiopeia. I then saw my shooting star, but it lasted much longer than any normal shooting star. Then about ten seconds after the object disappeared, there was a strange noise that I couldn't explain. Unfortunately no one else saw it, and it was flying fairly far away.<br>

[ADDENDUM FROM SOURCT]Yeah they appeared around 10:20 pm Central Time and started moving then disappeared around 10:24 pm they moved east then back west for a min then east at a faster rate and then they glowed brighter and vanished like just disappeared one second they were there then gone.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Oval object flying down at 45 degree angle with stream of light followingI wrote this down immediately after the sighting. At the time, I did not know there was any place to report it so I just kept my notes. At 6:05 PM on Nov 23rd 1998, I saw an object moving very quickly in the Eastern sky at about a 45 degree angle from Coon Rapids, Minnesota. The object was a flatter oval shape from my perspective as far as I could tell, but it was quite far away. The object had a light trail as you might expect from a falling star, but it was not moving as fast as a falling star and the light trail remained constant in brightness. Falling stars, by contrast typically start out small as they enter the atmosphere, grow larger and then burn out. Furthermore, you wouldn't see any object in front of the light trail with a falling star, you would just see the glow. The object I saw had a definite solid part followed by a stream of light equal to about three times the length of the object. I watched it for a good 3 to 4 seconds before it went out of site below the horizon. Given the distance it appeared to travel, the speed exceeded what even a fast military plane could go.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Orange saucer shaped stationary object hung in the sky like a fixed object. I was facing perfectly north from the back of my apartment complex parking lot, I cannot judge distance or be sure of the height in which I saw the following. I can only refer to my state of mind at the time as 100% calm but in awe. I was in awe that I was seeing an object so obviously not an airplane or other conventional craft. I have lived within 5 miles of the Mpls/St. Paul airport for all of my 38 years and have seen countless aircraft, even a Stealth Bomber once. This craft was basically oval in shape. The whole thing was emitting a pale orange, yellow glow. It was perfectly still and completely silent. It looked like a fixed object in the sky. I could not see any metal or anything indicative of what the craft was made of. The entire shape was of the glow aforementioned surrounded by some measure of haze or fog. I was not aware of it having moved at the time that I was watching it. The duration of the sighting lasted about 2 minutes. It was only after I left the area to catch my bus in order to get to work on time, (of all things!) , that I realized it must have moved quite drastically from its original position as for the last 30 seconds or so of the sighting my neck was craned upward quite a bit and the object turned into a much smaller orange light basically round or ovoid in shape[NUFORC Note: Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Fast shooting light through the clouds over Lake OwassoTwo of us were standing around a bonfire on the ice last Friday evening. There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest. As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished. I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky. I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars. Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere. The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground. After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don't travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I've ever seen and was not red or white. The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn't a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position. There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I've never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped) . The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point. I can't say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don't have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn't come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  8-10 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Large boomerang shaped invisible object blocked starlight while flying across skyI have a sketch and noted the year was 1999, but did not write down the day. The sighting took place in the late evening when it was completely dark and the sky was clear and full of stars. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed movement in the sky from the north moving to the south. When I looked closer, however, it wasn&#39;t an object that I was seeing move, rather it was the disappearance and reappearance of stars behind an object. The object itself was black or invisible with no lights. Given the area of stars that were blocked out, I would say the object was five times larger than a jet. It was completely silent. It was shaped like a boomerang only a little more rounded in front rather than triangle and a slightly sharper points on the “wing” tips. Since the object was invisible, I can only suggest the shape based on the black area absent of stars like a silhouette as it moved across the sky. If the object was indeed five times the size of a jet and flying at about the attitude of a jet, then it was moving much faster than a jet. I blinked a couple times, looked away and looked back, and then followed the object across the remainder of the horizon until it was out of sight. In all it took about 8-10 seconds to span the sky and flew at the same altitude the whole time. Given the triangular shape, I suppose it could have been a low-flying Stealth Bomber that just appeared much larger if flying low. But is a Stealth completely silent? Also, Stealth Bombers have three triangles pointing backwards from the mid section. The object I saw did not seem to have any mid section as such.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This is confirming the sighting from a previous postDuring the middle of the day I was fishing in a boat with my mother and a neighbor on Berkstrom lake in northern Minnesota. This is approximately 7-10 miles to the northwest of the below sighting. This cigar/circular light with multiple colors floated over the edge of the lake at approximately 200 feet. It was completely silent. It then left at an extremely high rate of speed at a 45 degree angle and was gone within seconds. This was never reported to my knowledge by anyone in the boat for fear of ridicule. This was also seen by a local farmer on the northwest edge of Camp Ripley. Please see referenced sighting below. There is no possible explanation other than UFO that I am aware of.

Guards asked for OD to go to their location in the North part of base. They pointed out over the northern sky three brigthly lit white circles that pulsated slightly. They were stationary at first and then moved at fantastic speeds, movements and speeds that I have never seen nor can I explain, moved in triangle type patterns. No noise, altitude was very high, in sky 1/2 distance from horizon to straight ahead. Left area by shooting straight away from us in an instant.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright falling object with a blue trail. Hi, I am a 15 year old sophomore in high school. We had the day off from school since thanksgiving is tomorrow. I woke up at eight for wrestling practice, came home ate and pretty much laid on the couch the rest of the day. I took a nap around five and woke up around seven thirty. I was sitting on my couch watching the movie X-Men Three. The way the room is set up is that you walk in and there is a couch on your right, and a chair to the left. The television is in the far corner of the room against the wall. So directly in front of the couch is this big window. I don't know why but I looked out the window and at that moment there was this bright object. It was circular I think. It was bright yellow kind of golden. It left this beautiful blue trail. The object was going down diagonally like it was crashing but it went behind the trees so I couldn't see it land. I don't know how far it was away but it fell to the east of my house pretty close I'd say within 25 miles. It was at 8:55 PM. I know this because I looked at my cell phone right away. I've never seen anything like these before. It could have been a meteor or UFO. I don't know what it was but I'm positive it was there.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I was watching Tiger Woods win his 3rd green jacket at my friends house when out of the corner of my eye out the patio window I thought I saw a hot air baloon in the blue sky, I immediately looked again because the darn thing did not have a basket un derneath and it took off really fast east on co rd. 42. It was a sphere copper in color it was divided into two halfs and the top half was divided in two also with the top right corner a darker red then the rest. I couldnt believe what I saw but told my friends abouted and they said I was nuts. Well three years later I was searching ancient ufo art online when I came across a painting from the french book "The book of morals". The painting shows a person in a long cone hat giving seeds to two farmers and in the sky a sphere the exact thing I saw in 2003. This painting was done in the year 1338. Now I swear I never saw that painting before my encounter yet the spheres are identical, what are the chances? Divided into two halfs and the top divided in two and the same color and size. I think I now have some sort of proof that it was not my imagination. The thing must have appeared in view of the patio window and not just a fly by or I would not have seen it. It went east at lighting speed from a dead stop and it was about 2/3 the size of a hot air baloon 100 yards above ground over Plymouth, Minnesota south west corner of hwy. 169 and 42th av n. It's wierd right over a big city 100 yards above a highway. Now I wonder if the guy with the pointy hat in the painting is covering his long skull, because archaeologists have found skulls in Peru with long skulls and they can't be human. I don't know what to make of this but it is very weird to see something that somebody painted 665 years ago.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I have seen a UFO from 100 yards away. In July of 2005 I was living at my parent&#39;s house in Mora, MN. I was in their sunroom that has two windows to the south and five windows to the west. Their backyard backs up to some thick woods. To the south the tree line continues for at least a mile or so. I was in the sunroom watching TV, facing the west wall. Suddenly for no reason at all I turned my head to the south. Just above the tree line, no more than 100 yards from the house there was a large cigar shaped disk hovering above the tree line. I looked as though it had just come out of the woods but that was ridiculous because there was no clearing that it would have fit into that I knew of. And I know those woods pretty well. This object was about two to three minivans in length. It was a silver color with red lights revolving around the middle. It had a disk shape with a dome top. It stopped and teetered for a moment. Then it just zoomed (for lack of a better word) off into the sky. I mean it was just gone in an instant. It was July and the windows were open because my parents are too cheap to run the AC at night. There was a low hum coming from the machine and that could have been why I turned my head to the south. Although there was a hum, the trees sat perfectly still. I was so scared I ran to all the windows and shut them. I then went upstairs and ran around to all the windows upstairs and closed and locked them. It was hot and humid but I didn&#39;t care. I have never been so scared in my whole life. I moved in with my fiancé two weeks later, but up until then every night I locked my window and my door at night. I haven&#39;t seen anything since then, however recently my brother and his friend watched a bright, non-blinking light move in the sky following the Snake River. At one point it stopped several times and made a 90 degree turn. My dad who is a non-believer also witnessed this from the front of his house two miles away. As an experienced pilot he knows that no planes, helicopters, or satellite moves the way this object did.! I don&#39;t know why we have seen all of these things, but I am sure there are others in Mora that have witnessed strange activity in the sky as well. I am reporting this now as I saw a “stock” photo of a UFO online today and I instantly burst into tears. I feel like a crime victim that is finally ready to confront the experience after years of holding it in. The only people I have told about this has been a few family members and my now-husband. I am not looking for “fame and fortune”, I just want people to know that there is something out there and I have seen it up close.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Burnt orange ill-defined vertical diamond shape moved at 150 mph W to E at 1:30 AM at 300 ft. Went to window to watch a low-flying helicopter move from west to east about a mile away. It was a clear, quiet night. Looking north from my second story bedroom window I pulled down the top sash of the double hung window to watch through the screen and smell the night air. The room light was off. As the helicopter moved off to the east and the blade noise faded I noticed a burnt orange-colored ball of light appear in the west and moving silently to the east seemingly tracking the helicopter but on a parallel path I estimated an additional mile north of the helicopter's flight path. The ball of light was moving about 150 mph, about half again as fast as the helicopter. It appeared to be about 600 ft above the ground. I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east. The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious. Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape. The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent. The size of the amorphous-shaped object, if two miles away at 600 feet, seemed to be between 30 to 40 feet, It was as tall as it was wide.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I was driving on a highly used freeway across a bridge. I Don't remember much, I just remember feeling like this doesn't seem normal. Planes don't just stay still. The first one i saw was right over my head and did NOT look like a plane. It had odd bright lights on it. Driving further down i saw another formation of lights further away. I had seen three bright "pulsing" lights in formation of a large triangle. One car ahead of me had pulled over to get a better look so i decided to do the same. Unfortunately, when I pulled over, it was out of sight. I arrived home and thought about going across the bridge again to see if i could get a better look. So i did, but i didn't see the same things, just planes. I called several friends but they just made fun of me. But one of my friends was actually driving too about an hour after i did and noticed the same things. A part of me logically says they were just planes, but another part of me says that it was more than that. never seen anything like it[NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It is not moving like a plane, but seems to wobble a little bit and light changes intensity, yet is very very bright. First explanation is that it could be Venus, but that would be lower to the horizon than this light. A friend with a telescope says he saw one bright light with 2 smaller lights on it too.

I studied it for a moment and concluded that it was not an airplane; I am familiar with the light patterns of airplanes, and this craft was flashing red, yellow, green and blue and seemed to be hovering in the night sky. I grabbed my digital camera and took some pictures. Looking at the craft with the naked eye, there were no “tails”, however, the “tails” were captured using the camera. I then proceeded to use my digital camera to record a video of the craft. In the video, we could see the movement: back and forth, up and down, and side to side, with no regular pattern. My husband proceeded to tell me on the phone that he and our daughter were trying to drive to the craft&#39;s location, but every time they got close, the craft would shoot to another location within view. Duration of sighting was at least two hours. Only one craft was sighted, its shape was hard to determine due to the distance, but seemed to be a bright light (extremely bright) with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue colors. Its motion was sporadic at times, but seemed to hover in the same general area in the sky. The weather conditions were as follows: very cold (approximately -20o) with clear skies. It was evening (after 6 pm Central time) . The next day, January 16, 2009, a relative from Mason City, Iowa called to say that their family of three also saw the object in the sky (I posted the video on the internet and sent them pictures as well) . Our teenage daughter also captured some pictures with her digital camera, showing more erratic movement and green “tails”. Distance was very hard to determine since the movement was not visible with the naked eye. I was standing at my patio doors, filming above my h! ead slig htly. From where I was standing, in order to cover it in the sky, I would have to have held up a dime.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Expeirence of Wonderness and mystery. . . Never thought could be so close, yet so far away. As I was driving along a Lake near Brainerd I noticed a strage light very low to the ground about 10 miles ahead of me. As I kept diving further I noticed the light was gone. A short distance later 2 large saucer shaped "crafts" with stangely bright lights had flown over my vehicle very close to me and for about 45 seconds they were flying along with me as I was driving along the lake. They had both coasted over the lake very slowly then very quickly went up to the sky. Later that night when I had gotten closer to my destination to town I noticed the same shaped and same lights were flying in a circular motion above me, then had quickly disapeared. I have never expeirenced such a sudden rush of wonderness when the "crafts" were so close to me, this was an expeirence that I thought never imaginable since I could tell they were of mysterious figures and were very strange seeming to me.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright amber lights, rotating around with small white lights moving quickly and erratically in night sky. At 9:40pm this evening, while standing on my steps, I was looking towards the eastern sky when I witnessed 3 large amber lights, they were all symmetrical to one another and evenly spaced apart. The lights were much larger than any star and I would compare the total width of the 3 lights in a row to that of a full moon that is just rising up. (When the moon is brighter orange and appears to sit just above tree top levels.) I watched the bright amber lights rotate towards the north, (my left facing east) and witnessed another complete set of 3 amber lights, with the rotation the lights appeared to stay within the same proximity of one another and also appeared to be what I would say part of the same “craft”, being the one set of lights rotated around out of my sight and another set appeared. I witnessed the bright amber lights for approximately 15 seconds, and just as the lights had rotated I witnessed 3 or 4 smaller white lights, what would appear the size of a star in the sky, these white lights were moving around very erratically in the same general area of the amber lights. After contacting the National UFO Reporting Center, I contacted the local law enforcement and was informed by the deputy sheriff that he had also witnessed the same lights as well as another witness that was in his squad car at the time. The sheriff&#39;s location at the time of the sighting was approximately 12-17 miles east north east of my location, and he witnessed the lights to the west of his location. [NUFORC Note: We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be both sincere, and sober-minded. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Looked like a satellite, but moved in all sorts of different directions at varying speeds. I was out stargazing at the nearby county park with a new college friend. It was a pretty cloudy night, with not many visible celestial bodies to begin with. We both sighted a couple satellites moving across the sky early on. After about an hour of being out under the stars and clouds, I spotted a stationary light towards the east start to move, at a similar speed as satellites do in the night sky. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the speed of the "satellite" seemed to be varying. I remember thinking, "no way, if that's a UFO I am going to flip. " The light then completely turned and started moving 90 degrees in a different direction. That's when I got giddy! And it continued its erratic flight for a good four or five minutes, increasing and decreasing in speed, even stopping every so often for a couple seconds, zig-zagging around the same area in the sky, and changing directions quickly, too fast for a plane to be capable of doing by my estimates. But eventually I lost sight of it in the clouds. This was the first time I've ever seen anything like that! Such a cool experience.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw a big blue light and a smaller red light dropped out of the blue light. They passed over me and took off up into the sky. My sister reports hearing her dogs barking madly. Went outside her home and looked to the Western sky. Noticed a pretty bluish white star in the sky. The star started moving slowly in her direction. It stopped, and a smaller red star dropped out of the bigger blue star. The bigger blue star continued moving towards her. Midway into her back yard it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. She turned and watched the red one slowly start coming her way. She started backing up towards the light on her porch. The red star moved slowly towards her, kept moving, but even slower as it came over her. She heard a low humm coming from the red object only. She felt that she was being observed. She figured the hell with it (she has seen so many in her area) that she waved at the red star twice. On the second wave she stated bye, and it took off straight up towards the Southeast sky into a pinpoint and was gone. During this whole experience her dogs where barking uncontrollably. Once the objects were gone, the dogs stopped barking. She doesn't have access to a computer/Internet and requested I report this incendent to someone. Thank You For Your Time<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Last night, about 12 midnight on April 4th, 2009, I was sitting in our sunroom (large windows) at our computer looking at colleges online for our daughter. My husband was in the bathroom getting ready for bed (brushing his teeth) . Our house was silent, no tv on, no computer sound on. Both our kids were staying at friends homes. I then heard this loud humming noise. WOOoooWoooWOOoooWOOooo. I looked towards the noise that was coming from behind the house. I was frozen at what I saw. There were double twin light beams coming from the sky, directly down to the ground. The light was not dissipated as a flash light would be. The beams were moving up and down within the beam itself. There was both the noise and the double twin beams happening at the same time. My husband came out of the bathroom asking what the weird noise was. He thought that it was something on the computer or I had the tv on. He looked towards the tv and the computer and seen there was no noise coming form either. He looked at me standing by the large windows and said what was that noise? The noise and the lights were gone, but he had heard the noise and it brought him out of the bathroom to question it. He heard the noise over brushing his teeth and running water. I told him about the lights and he believed me. We have no noise out here. We live on 25 acres with a few hundred acres of farmland, woods and crp land behind us. Our house sits up on a hill with an unobstructed view of the sky. Our sunroom has very large windows that go up to a peak. I tell you this so that you can see that I had a very clear view of what I saw. As far as the weather, it was snowing and the humidity was high. Sound doesn't travel well in that kind of weather. On days when it's calm and dry or cold, you can hear semis 4 miles south of hear humming down a highway. This was not that. The light beams had two separated strands on the left side going straight up and down from the ground to the sky. The light beams on the right were also two separated light beams going straight up and down to the sky. I looked up to see where they were coming from, but because of the snow, the beams went into what ever they call the low snow ceiling. I then talked to my husband about what just happened. We both went outside to listen for any more noise. There was nothing. Then he took his 10 million candlepower flashlight out and pointed it out in the backyard. With a flashlight we did the same thing. Both times, the light would spread out and you could see all the snow coming down. With the double twin light beams that I witnessed, they were solid stands. No breaking up of the beams, just straight lines down. I then called my 19 year old daughter that was in the town 5 miles away and asked her if she heard/seen anything. They were watching movies in her friends basement. Nothing. I decided that it did need to be reported, so after about 15 minutes, I decided to call the Rice County Mn non emergency sheriffs' telephone number. The dispatcher did take the call seriously. She was nice about it and said that I did need to repeat the story to a deputy. She transferred the phone to him. I told him about what happed. He was also great about what I told him. I told him that I work as a librarian at a local high school, I don't drink and I don't smoke. I am a middle age women that has 2 kids, a farm and would not make up what happened last night. He had me describe in detail for their report, about what happened . He said that there are too many reports world wide of this stuff happening for some of it not to be real, and the universe is too large for us to believe we are the only one here. I felt the need to report this to them, and I also feel the need to report this on your sight also. I did go outside this morning to see if there was any visible sign on the ground to where the beams were touching, but I could not see any. It did snow about 2 to 3 inches overnight. I hope this info helps. [NUFORC Note: The witness, who submitted this report, appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program at 7:00 AM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. She did an excellent job of describing the event, and her story sounded to us to be quite credible. Her description of the event did not deviate from her description above. PD]<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Triangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Triangle Craft Spotted in early hours moving silently above treetops. I have not spoken to many people about this sighting. I am a commercial rated pilot. Short and sweet, I saw a very dark triangle in the Merriam Park area of St, Paul, MN, around August of 2003. I was picking up my girlfriend to give her a ride to work at about 5 am in a very populated area when I spotted a black triangle in the sky at approx. 500-1000 ft above ground level. It moved from east to west. I immediately identified it as a ufo because it had only 3 lights, one at each corner of it's triangle shape. All three lights were white. The lights were not bright and were pointed down. I opened my window and heard no noise, just silence. I tried to follow it, but could not keep up in the city block grid system. I estimate that it was moving at about 30mph. I have heard that there has been ongoing activity in this area of the Twin Cities for some years. Some claim that the river is an attractive spot to these craft. The nearest airport would depart aircraft in nowhere near this direction and the departing airplanes would have certainly gained thousands of feet of elevation at this distance.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Circle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  45 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> nightime, fuzzy circle (a bit brighter than a nightime cloud) with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath, moving quickly NNW. The event occurred as I was on the north side of my home just gazing at the night sky directly to the east of my location. There were a few visible clouds in that direction but I would not be able to tell how high they were but they were not low clouds. . perhaps a couple miles or more in altitude. As I was scanning the sky, I noticed an minimally bright object maybe a bit brighter than the clouds themselves against the night sky. It was moving perhaps 2-3 times or so as fast as satellites I've seen but in a north-northwesterly direction. I could not tell how big or how far away it was but it seemed to go behind a cloud (as it dimmed) . The cloud seemed thick enough to obscure light though but I could still see the object. It seemed to be a perfectly circular shape about the brightness of a cloud with fuzzy, out-of-focus edges. It was about the size of a pencil eraser in an outstretched hand. It moved quickly, in my estimation and then slowed a bit and changed to a more west-north-west direction and then appeared to speed up and head North-northwest again and it went out of my line of sight over some houses. I had wondered if my vision was fuzzy initially but I changed my mind about that almost right after I saw the object because directly below the fuzzy circle (at a distance of about 1-1/2 to 2 diameters of the circle) was a small, intermittently flashing amber light. It did not seem to flash regularly and if I were to guess, each flash was between 1 second to 5 seconds apart. It seemed to be the same color of amber that I have only seen once before. After 9-11, the Twin Cities skies were devoid of all aircraft, of course, but I went to look at the quiet sky a day or two afterward and remember seeing the same color of amber light flying above us in the night sky. It was a couple F-16s patrolling the airspace around us. We never see F-16s in this area of Minnesota so when I saw that deep amber color and read that F-16s were in the area, I knew it was a special military beacon. I heard no sound from whatever I saw. My first thought was that I would describe what I saw as a fuzzy white, circular balloon with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath it. I am curious if anyone else has seen something like this.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> perfect triangle of moving orange lights in MinnesotaFourth of July, my cousin and I were watching TV in the basement at my uncles house waiting for my aunt and uncle to get back home. All of the sudden the downstairs door opens and my uncle sticks his head in and says, "get out here you gota see this". We assume its just some cool fireworks across the lake, but when we get out there we see two yellow/orange lights in the air slowly moving south in perfect tandum. My uncle said that when he first saw them they did a 180 degree rotation without changing distance between each other. So it takes about 5 minutes for these two lights to slowly move into the distance and disappear (we said they moved about as fast as helicopters do from a distance) . Once they disappear I am convinced that they were some crazy fireworks that someone launched somehow. But as we were heading in three big lights of the same color take off from the horizon straight into the air like something out of the movies, and form a perfectly symmetrical triangle in the air and slowly heads towards the south as well. No I do not believe in aliens as of now but I don't think there is an explanation for what I saw. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

<b>SHAPE:</b>  Rectangle<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  5 mins.<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Enormous Rectangle object with rows of red and white lights In either the spring or fall of 1983 or 1984 while driving down Highway 13 in Burnsville, MN I saw something unbelievable. It was approx between 8:30-9pm and I was driving eastbound on highway 13. I noticed through the upper right corner of my windshield HUGE lights. At first I thought it was a blimp because it was moving so slowly SW to NE. It was so odd that I pulled off the road so I could get a better look at it. There was a football game going on at the Burnsville high school and so I initially thought it was a blimp that was going to hover over the field with a display like the American Flag? But, it had rows of lights (one row of red the next row white with several rows) but after pulling onto the side of the road and I got a better look at it I saw there were only rows of red and white and it was a rectangle shape and wasn't a blimp. It was enormous, I'd have to guess it was close to the size of a football field at minimum. I remember wondering how it stayed afloat because it was moving so slow. So I rolled my window down so I could hear if there was any engine noise. There was possibly a faint hum at best, but it was hard for me to tell because cars were passing by and it wasn't quiet enough. I sat and watched it slowly move out of sight and there was one other car in front of me that had also pulled off the road. I never spoke to the person/s in the car in front of me, now I wish I would have so we could have shared observations. I had been on my way to meet a group of friends at Burnsville Bowl, when I arrived they asked why I was so late. I remember looking at my watch, but since it's been so many years ago I cannot remember how late I was or how much time I was missing. I know I was confused because I had told them I saw some weird cool lights but had only sat on the side of the road for maybe 15 minutes. I never reported the sighting because I was convinced that HUNDREDS of people would have seen the same thing I had because of it's size and slow speed and surely many people would call it in! I did faithfully watch the news for the next few days hoping I'd hear about it but never did. I'm regretful that I did not report the sighting then because now I cannot provide an accurate date or time. Now I think I understand why so few photographs exist, because while it was happening I was unable to take my eyes off of it and was completely mesmerized! I may not have an exact time/date, but I will not forget what I saw. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Blinding lights over Britt, MNMr. Davenport , Details of our sighting, Highway 53 North. Britt Minnesota. August 15-16 We were traveling north approximately 10 miles north of Virginia MN when we came into a clearing on the west side of the highway. Just beyond the clearing there was an intense Blue/White light that was pulsing. At first I was thinking it might have been an airport light off track. But the closest airport was 20 miles away to the north. I noticed it was keeping pace with us at 45 mph. The light was so intense you could not look directly into it. The light tracked with us for 12 miles up highway 53 north and it took a due west heading out of sight. I proceeded to drive highway 53 another mile and right before my turn. I spotted the second light floating right above some ones house on the west side of the rode. I was able to see the light pulse from the first sighting off in the distance so this was a new light I drove to my turn onto Biss road. I pulled over to get a better look to my south approximately 25 yards away from us this light was above a home. I shut the truck! off and rolled down the windows. There was no sound at all the light burned your eyes to view. We sat there maybe 15 minutes and decided to go on our way. I drove 5 miles up the rode and decided I had to get another look we drove back and watched the light for another 10 minutes. It appeared to me to be maybe 5 feet around. The light was so bright that it was impossible to see what was above it. The persons yard was like daylight. I continued to my cabin 15 miles north west of Britt and was still able to see the pulsing in the night sky to the southwest. I will have my son and his friend write their accounts as soon as possible. Also my car radio would not work while we were watching the lights. Thanks[NUFORC Note: We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally serious about his sighting, and sober-minded, by nature. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Basically a dark spot in the night sky with very distinct non-aircraft lights, Went from SW to NE My three cousins and myself were sitting around a fire just outside of northfield, MN. I will be honest, I had a couple to drink, but two of the other three were sober. I was staring into the west night sky when I saw a very dark shape with two lights in the front section, which were solid spots, and two whitish, almost rope light lights on the tail this thing flew completely silent. I sat up and said "holy sh!t a UFO!!" my cousins turned around and looked into the sky, as they saw it, we all stood up and were hysterical over the occurance. My cousins and I all saw the same thing, and it seemed like it was a triangle shape. As I was watching it fly from the SW to the NE, I attempted to take a picture with my phone. I looked at the phone to find out the screen was black. I watched it fly over a line of trees and disappear from my sight, and my cousins turned toward me and each other and asked "where did it go?" I told them it went behind the trees, so we moved about 20 feet to be able to see it again, but it was to no avail. Now today as I write this, I have a strange pattern of red circles on my back that I do not know whether or not are related to the sighting, but the circles are about half inch in diameter, and are extremely consistent and in almost a waffle iron pattern. They are not raised and there is no irritation on my skin. I had my wife take a picture of them so I can relay them to my friend in the NSA one day.

<b>DURATION:</b>  5 minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Saw an object, and several Military jets flew toward it in an area where we rarely see military jets overhead. My wife and I were driving down State Highway 65 in MN from Isanti to Fridley on a clear spring day. We were about 15 minutes into our drive when I glanced out the drivers side window to the east and saw a teardrop shaped object that appeared to be falling in the sky, and left absolutely no trail outside of the taper to the teardrop "point". The object was about 3/4 white and the center of it was a dull black, almost a matte black. I was watching the object, about 30 seconds after I saw it we heard fighter jets flying. we saw 4 jets flying directly at the object, and the closest air base is about 100 miles away in Brainerd. The jets flew directly at the object, which appeared to be slowly descending about 30 degrees above the horizon. At this point the jets had appeared to be closing in. Suddenly we heard another jet, and looked to see 3 more (i think) jets flying toward the object. I would estimate that the object was somewhere above central Wisconsin. As the jets are flying, we looked toward the west and saw a bullet shaped silver craft that appeared to be burning atmosphere. Then another fighter jet flew toward the west. The object descended past the tree line, where neither of us could see it anymore. The object in the west has taken a turn and headed south where we lost track of it in the sun.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> That thing was not built around hereI worked 2nd. shift at F. M. C. Fridley, Mn. as a machinest. I lived in North Branch, Mn. Going N. on I 35 on my way home I saw two very bright searchlights on the E. side of the highway about 5-10 miles south of N. Branch. As I got closer I thought it was a hellicopter. I did 4 years of active duty in the Navy, including a tour in Viet Nam as a fwd. gunner on a PBR (Patrol boat river) . . . I know and love hellicopters. My 1st. thought was a lost hunter being sought. I slowed to a stop and pulled onto the shoulder of the road. The craft was about 50 feet over the scruffty trees. . . there was snow on the ground. I got out of my car and watched it angle toward me from the N. N. E then angle away to the S. E. Speed about 30 mph. It made no noise. I could have hit it with a sling shot Two spotlights on front slightly outboard of center, two "clearance lights" on outside, flat bottom. Snow illuminated the underside, appeared to have hydraulic lines incorperated into it. I would guess 50 ft. long , 20 ft. wide sillouette like a Ford Gt. 40. A large reddish ball in the rear. I called the sheriffs dept. and asked if there were any sightings. . . from a pay phone. . NO. I did not persue this due to my job`s security clearance.

The search and rescue team from Forest Lake Fire and Resuce responded with its airboat to a call from 10050 N. 204th Street just before 2 AM of a sizeable object landing in the body of water located south of Scandia Trail (TH-97) . The Washington County Dive Team also had nine members searching below the surface through murky water to depths of around 26 feet without locating anything. Nada. Before the dive team arrived, search and rescue spied air bubbles in a 20 foot diameter. According to Forest Lake Fire Chief Gary Sigfrinius, the report from a credible eyewitness turned out to be unfounded. He said the lakeshore property owner was doing laundry in the basement and saw a large swirl and it appeared the water was churning. According to the incident report made to the Forest Lake Police Department, the caller looked into the sky and thought the wave action was from a helicopter. Sigfrinius told the Forest Lake City Council there was no petroleum film from a boat/plane wreck or debris floating on the water surface. We don&#39;t know what it was, ” he said.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A bright light that went from moving slowly to extremely fast to stationary and then gone with no sound or acceleration. I was driving home from my girlfriends and it was late. There were no other cars on the road. I saw a light that was steady and not blinking. It was just a plain white light. It looked like a bright star. It was moving low to the ground and moving slowly. At first I thought it was a helicopter and just kept watching it because it stuck out in the air over the open fields. Then it started moving very fast in one direction and then back in the same direction it just came from. When I say fast I mean very fast. It did not accellerate it was instantly moving fast. It did this for about half a minute going back and forth in the sky. Then it stopped moving for a few seconds all together and was stationary in the sky. Then it started to move slowly around again like when I first spotted the light. I then proceeded to pull over and tried to get a video of it on my phone. When I was trying to get any kind of picture resolution on my phone it just shot into space so fast and was gone. To someone reading this it might seem like a helicopter is actually what I saw looking for something or someone. But there is no way a helicopter could move the way this light was moving. I would not pull over to look at a helicopter. I instantly called my girlfriend and told her what I had just seen and she said I was crazy. I know that what I saw was a ufo there is nothing manmade that could do what I saw this thing do. I never believed in ufos until that night and now im a believer.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> I've only waited until now to submit a report bacause I have not found an authentic looking source to submit it to. I was spending time at a friend's house late that night, we were sitting outside talking when we both noticed a slight flash off to our side that only lasted a split second, by the time we could react and look, it was gone. However, we could recall it moving sideways for it quick duration. Not two minutes later it passed again, but this time we were looking in the general direction from having interest. Again lasting only a second, it was very far away and was seemingly very large, or was extremely bright. We could both describe it as if someone was shining a flashlight on the clouds, except there were no clouds, which left us obviously baffled at what we just saw. I will honestly say that I don't know for sure whether or not it was extraterrestrial, or maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, which I could believe both to be possible scenarios.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> During a vacation with my son on a lake in Minnesota we went for a late night cruise and had a couple beers while looking at the stars in the clear night sky. After seeing what we thought where satellites and watching them along with planes pass by I noticed a light coming over the trees from the south. The light was white and moving fast and what appeared to be very high, as high as the satallites. The light would get bright and dim very slowley and seem to disappear but only got dim. You could still see it through the binoculars while it was dim. Then as it got overhead we were both surprised to notice at the same time there where more than one and all going in formation and all getting bright and dim at different times. No noise, no trails and thay kept going north until thay disappeared in the sky. At that point we saw two aircraft lights coming from the west (Fargo) and head north as if looking for something. We agreed there must have been 8 object but, they where difficult to count because of the dimming and brightening.

As my friend and I were sitting at a local park in my community, I was lying on the hill looking into the sky, and she was looking off into the distance. As I was looking up, I saw a kind of bright flash of light start to go through the sky. At first it started to look like a shooting star, but then I realized it couldn't be because it was very large in size and it flew underneath the clouds. The atmosphere of this situation was a very dark muggy night. The sky was completely covered with clouds, except for a few wholes where u could see a few stars. It was a yellow tinted light. Pretty large in size. It flew underneath where the clouds are and then it just kind of vanished suddenly.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> UFO - Viewed From Downtown Minneapolis, MNObservation location: Across the street from Orchestra Hall, 1210 Marquette Ave. , Minneapolis, MN, looking down Marquette Ave. toward the Wells Fargo and IDS Towers. Description: Object was a light, appearing from this vantage point to be above the Wells Fargo Tower. The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower. The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again. The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again. Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again. There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute. On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second. There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location. There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter. There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity. The second witness,! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors. Luminosity: Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky. Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself. Other: The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation. Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed. There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object. I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before. I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object. Opinion: This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird. The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.

They were flying in a straight line and keeping the exact distance between them the whole time. The lead craft was a very dim light and the second following light was very bright. When I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then I noticed it was following a dimmer light. I watched as they flew north then gradually changed direction and started west to North Branch. The unusual part was the lack of blinking lights and It was bright as it was going away from me. Generally the planes I see go dark as they go away from me. They were silent which also seemed unusual to me. [NUFORC Note: ISS and Space Shuttle in formation. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Fireworks and UFO, MN State Fair Grounds July 4th late 70's early 80's. State Fair Grounds It was late 70's early 80's on July 4th at the State Fair grounds. Thousands of people were watching fireworks in the bleachers and parked out in the fields in our cars. I was with my X husband. I was laying on the hood, my back against the windshield. (No alcohol was involved) We were all watching fireworks when I noticed the sky coming down, closer. When I realized something was happening I couldn't move. I realized it was a HUGE ufo that was passing slowly east to west. It was so low you could see how it was riveted together, the seams of the craft and all the lighting. It made no sound. I was scared to death and finally leaned to the right and fell off the car. I wanted to hide under the car. I could only get near the tire. I wanted to scream but couldn't. I realized I was not suppose to remember this happening. I kept telling myself I will remember, I will remember. The craft size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds bleacher area where they hold concerts! and races. It started to rise up while heading west. After a period of time I heard a launch of a fire work, then slowly another. Little by little people started moving, and talking (oohs and aaahs) I was able to slowly get up and I asked my X if he remembered it. He said yes, but acted like he was in a trance. We went home, I insisted and we each drew pictures of the object that matched. For years when I would mention this story I knew deep down I wasn't suppose to talk about. I know I am not suppose to remember this. But I do. It is simple I know what I know. I expected it to be on the news and in the paper. Nothing! I would have thought it would have showed up on radar or something. For years I have wondered if someone who was there just like me remembers. For years I have just said I know what I know. I don't care who believes it I just know.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 5 orange lights in a V shape in the sky moving slowly south for 40 seconds then it sped up &amp; disappeared. We walked outside at about 9:15 pm on August 29th 2009 and looked up and noticed 5 lights in a V shape moving slowly south. We watched for about 40 seconds trying to figure out what it was when suddenly it sped up and disappeared out of site. Whatever it was made no noise whatsoever. We are used to a lot of airline traffic overhead and helicopters coming and going from the local hospital but if there is no sound the aircraft is very high and the lights very small and this seemed low enough we should have heard it. A day later someone reported in the local newspaper that they saw an orange flame in the sky. She was directly south-southeast of us by a few blocks. I imagine what she was seeing was the craft when it sped up and it became a blur before it disppeared. Is there a military craft with lights like this that makes no noise? One that can also move slowly and then take off at warp speed?<br>

It traveled from south to north in a straight line. I was driving east and saw it out the drivers side window, looking almost straight up. It disappeared (burned out, like a meteorite) after traveling about 20 degrees (that is, assuming 180 degrees from horizon to horizon, it traveled a fraction of that) . There were no sparks or a tail, just a bright green glow as if from a roman candle. I was in farm country and there were no houses nearby.

Not long after he also witnesses a "quiet" American born fighter jet fly above head. In a panic he calls my cousin and aunt telling them of the incident. Well instead of waiting for my dad to come and pick them up to "come and see for themselves" my cousin and aunt go on their own mission knowing that UFO's do not stay around for long. Driving on 96 away from white bear lake my aunt and cousin recall an even more tragic side of the story in which an extremely bright white light hovers in the sky and suddenly as they are gazing upon the white light they see several lights burst away from this light and then the bright light suddenly is nonexistent . My aunt believes she saw an apparent UFO crash my dad be! lieves he did not see the UFO's themselves but instead he saw several helicopters and the obvious jet plane that flew above him in the sky. In two separate places my dad and family may have seen two separate occurrences. Who will ever know?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Silver hammered disc shaped object over Snowbank Lake, Minnesota, June 1970Back in June of 1970, at Snowbank Lake, Minnesota, around 9:00 pm, there were three of us on a boat fishing, myself and my two uncles. While sitting in the boat fishing and looking out at our surrounding, all of a sudden coming up above the tree line, parallel to us was a silver hammered disc shaped object, no sound, moving very slowly towards us, about a 1/2 mile away , heading north to Canada. All three of us stood up in the boat looking at this object and then we saw four “Airsac” jets (being out of Duluth, Minnesota air force base) were roaring towards us, breaking the sound bearer, which was above our heads and in pursuit of this object. Object went straight up into the air and we watched the jets take off after it. It must have been about 7 to 8 minutes chasing it into Canada. After perusing it a short time later the same jets flew back over our boat again. About 1, 000 feet above us, going slow and we could see the pilots, giving us thumbs up and w! e gave them thumbs up too. Yes, I do believe we are not alone.

It appeared to be some distance away from me, possibly over the Oneota Cemetery area. I do not know how long the object was there for, but I observed it for five minutes until it just blinked out at 12:52 AM. The object was moving very slowly. It appeared to be moving North and possibly slightly West. I used two pine trees and the roof of a house as guides to determine that the object was indeed moving very slowly and to the North. The object looked like a fireball, but clearly was not a meteor, flare, or an airplane. The object made no noise that I could hear. I didn't notice any other aircraft in the area.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> black triangle flew silently overhead at tree top levelThis report is for the purpose of authenticating a previous report filed for the date 6-15-1983, in the area of Redwing, MN. I found this site some time ago and when I found it had reports dating back many years, I decided to see if anyone else reported what I saw many years ago. Much to my surprise, I did. In the early summer of 1983, I was 11 years old, my girlfriend and I were having a sleepover at her house in St. Paul Park, MN. After a few hours of fun running around the neighborhood late at night, we settled down for bed in the back of her fathers pick-up truck, which was parked in the drive way (no topper on truck) . As we lay there talking and looking up at the sky, a very large black triangle, silently passed over us. It had no lights on that I could discern. It moved at what I would guess to be 10-15 mph. It was just above tree top level. It created no wind. It was very unnatural in its behavior. Even though I was 11 years old, I knew this was not some normal aircraft. My friend and I became very quiet and went right to bed after that. I told my family. They did not believe me at the time. I have shared this with many people over the years including my husband, who heard this from me long before I ever found this site. Needless to say I was excited when I found out someone else saw the very same thing I did (validation) . I feel confident it must have been the same night. Redwing , MN is just south of St. Paul Park. My little school friend and I never really talked about what we saw at the time, but many years later, when we were adults, I tried to talk to her about it because I could never forget about it. She said she didn't remember it at all and acted as if I was strange. I know she saw it at the time because it was frightening. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> a ship hoovered over this police carI was hitchhiking home on Woodland Avenue in Duluth Minnesota in the late 1960's from a friends house on a warm summer day. I was not getting a ride so I was walking on the boulevard near Hartley Field when I noticed what looked like these lights which were going around in a circle. They were red and blue. I could not see a shape yet as they were in the top of the tree line. They hovered there for about 1 minute when all of a sudden they started to rise slowly. As they got above the tree line I could make out a shape which looked like two saucers laying one on top of the other. It stayed at this altitude for about another 30 seconds when all of a sudden it took off and was gone very, very quickly. I don't remember my reaction to this as whether I was frightened or not. I did not have much time to think about this anyway as I seen this car going very fast on this dirt road in Hartley field and hitting Woodland Avenue and without stopping sped away at a very! high speed. Now you would have to see how dangerous this can be as the dirt road is a steep hill and when you got up to Woodland Avenue there was a stop sign because it is in the middle of a sharp curve and you don't just run this stop sign without looking both ways. As this car sped away I noticed that it was a police car! I thought wow here this police car had come out of Hartley field right where the ship was hovering! I did not have much to to think about this though as a friend picked me up and asked if I had seen this. I really do not remember anything else we said, and I never really talked much about this. I think I was afraid that no one would believe me. I always wondered though if those two policemen filed a report or told anybody as it was plain to see that they seen this.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Orbiting light spheres and gold lights in boomerang shapeI went out on my deck, which overlooks 1+ acres of woods in sunurb of Burnsville, off Burnsville Pkwy and Cty Rd 5 at about midnight. Between the treetops and above, clear sky view, I spotted 2 large orbs of white light, rapidly circling each other in a large circle, about the size of a football field. The sky was completely covered by dense clouds and the light circles were quite visible. They never waivered from their distance from eachother, but did move sideways from time to time. It resembled a planet with an orbiting planet. . . . not an irregular path. I watched for several minutes and then started to take photographs with my digital camera and flash. I could see nothing in the view window after they were taken, but kept shooting. Suddenly, several gold orbs or lights appeared in an arc shape, appearing to flash or move. Then the clouds completely went away, revealing a totally clear sky with lots of stars. In an instant, the lights just vanished. One of the photos I have sent has been lightened and set to very high contrast, to show the area was above the treetops. No city lights, just sky. At first, I thought it might be advertising beams shooting into the air, but it started at midnight and there were no beams back to earth. I called the police and they had no reports and no knowledge of any promotional beamed lighting in the area. I thought it might be northern lights or lightening, but it had a very set and regular pattern path. The gold lights were not visible to the naked eye when there was cloud cover, but the early photos showed them. [NUFORC Note: Witness corrected date to November 29. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> We seen it realy close over our us , I panic because over me was a ufo that I would read in fiction books. . . . At the time, me at the age of 14, my little sis at the age of 12 and our dad. We left our farm home to buy groceries 40 minutes away and leaving our home out on the country about 10 miles away i was in the front passenger seat of our van listening to my walkman. Remember it was realy dark . No light post or any source of light but the headlights of our van. All of a sudden i see light on our dashboard. At the moment it took me a while to figure out why is there light on our dashboard when there is no light post outside. So I took a glance through the windshield and seen a round craft with lights pointing straight down right above our van realy close hovering over us. Right there and then I scream at my dad while he's driving and told him, "look up!". He looked up and stopped the van right away with a look of shock in his face. I got out of the van not fealing any danger , so my dad got out too. We looked up at this round saucer that resembled a pepperoni pizza but upside! down, but think of it like this. The pepperonies were the lights pointing straight down and this hovering object was realy quiet without making any noise what-so-ever. I could here my sister scream realy, realy loud, I turned to look at her but she was alright. She was only sticking her head out my window looking up and screaming and crying . This object was over us for about 2 minutes and then started to move realy slowly twards a field where we could follow it, there was no road. Only a fenced up field. Another thing , this thing had a front and back to it . Even though it was round because what was the front had a spotlight going crazy lighting up, down, side-to-side. So this round saucer like I always seen on tv and read in fiction books was moving away from me until it disapeared. Me and my sister still try to remind each other if what we seen was real, but she shuts me up and doesn't want to talk about it. . . . . . . life, is not the same for me.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Octagon shaped craft made a 90 degree turnSaturday, Sept. 19th 11:08 PM I like to sit on the patio at night and look for satellites. I was sitting on our patio outside relaxing after just having a house full of company leave. I saw what I thought at first was a satellite because it was moving about the same speed they usually move. But the I noticed it wasn't moving in a straight line, it was moving in an elongated wavy pattern. As I looked closer I could see an Octagon shape behind the light. I watched it for about 5 seconds when it took a 90 degree turn to the right and headed south at the same speed. There was no noise whatsoever. I'm not a good one for guessing altitude but I would say it looked about the size of a quarter in the sky. It was maybe 8-10 thousand feet up.<br>

The moon and stars were especially clear on this night. My girlfriend, brother and I noticed a close cluster of 6 "stars" which were twinkling. It was very unusual for us because we all agreed that we have never noticed this cluster of "stars. " After observing this cluster we noticed there were changes in the formation of the lights and they were moving towards Orion's belt area. They sometimes changed formations but tried to maintain a V formation as they journeyed towards Orion's belt. Even until an hour later they are there but are as far away as stars would be. My digital and video camera were unable to pick up the pictures. I called the Police Department and was informed there was very little they can do.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> UFO chases car 8 miles. 4 witnesses. Several sightings afterward. Kim, Terri, and I were driving to Nikki's house, Kim's cousin (about 6:30pm) . We were all about 17-18 years old and it was Valentine's day. Nikki and Kim were living about a 1/2 mile from each other in a remote farming area. It was dark and the roads were icy. Kim's mother had reported numerous times to her family that there was a UFO that followed her to work daily. Each morning the lit object would wait for her above the mail box and one day, she claims the object beamed down a light and flew over the hood of her car. On one hand, I believed her because she is an honest "no nonsense" person, but on the other hand, it's definately something you need to see to believe! Kim began seeing the object after her mother woke her up and pointed it out to her one morning. TO NOTE: Kim has an uncle that is very paranoid of aliens being able to see him at night, to the point of shooting out the overhead farm lights. He lived about 6-7 miles away. My mother bought a telescope to watch the skies after seeing UFO's over Lake Miltona in the 80's. My uncle has seen UFO's in Park Rapids, MN while jogging along wooded trails. I have several friends and aquaintances who claim to have seen UFO's (about 10) . My husband says he used to watch UFO's while having field parties in Miltona in the early 90's. On Feb. 14th at about 6:30pm, my friends and I picked up Nikki. Terri was driving and Kim was in the passenger seat. I was sitting in the back seat of a 4-door car. When we pulled into the driveway, Kim yelled, "See, there it is! That's what I've been seeing!" We all observed a UFO hovering above the silo. Nikki had also seen it and immediately jumped into the back seat. The object was round and white in appearance. Although it was bright, the light appeared to be self-contained, meaning that it didn't emit light like a flashlight or lightbulb. When we drove away, the object came straight down from the sky and then followed along-side the vehicle. It was about the size of our car. It followed along the ditches, move up over trees and power lines, then would dip back down along side us. It was icy and we took back roads (gravel) for 8 miles to my mother's house in Miltona, MN. All of us were hysterical and crying, yelling at Terri to drive faster. There was no other traffic on the gravel roads and but Terri had to drive slowly. Once we hit Highway 14, the object moved higher up into the sky and moved behind us. A large beam of light came down like a helicopter spotlight. I felt like something snapped in my brain. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it seemed nearly audible. This is the point at which I'm not sure exactly what happened. I'm not sure if I imagined what COULD have happened, or if it actually DID happen. The car was stopped. No one was screaming or crying and everyone else was staring straight ahead, motionless. There wasn't any lights on the dash, no clock, etc. , and the car wasn't running. I think there was a small man (being) next to my car door. We had locked all the doors upon seeing the UFO. The man telepathically told me to open the door and I refused. It said, "We're going to get in anyway. Make it easier on yourself and unlock the door. " I reached over and unlocked it and don't remember anything else. BUT, it was as if we DIDN'T stop the car. The light had come out and chased us, closing in on us slowly, and just when it was almost on top of us, a car came from the other direction and it was gone in a flash, going in the other direction. I had regression hypnosis to help me remember this incident, and as it turns out, I'm just one of those people who can't be hypnotised. What luck! But, I was able to recall details just from simply telling the story to the hypnotist over and over again. It seemed that each time I could remember another small little detail. But, when it comes to the spot where I'm not sure if we stopped or not, I was confused each time. I simply came up with, "and then it was gone and we went to my house. " My friend also had hypnosis and swears that she and her cousin were taken up into a spaceship. I was not present at her hypnosis session, but she said it was pretty intense. Over the next two months or so, I saw the UFO several times at my house (daily, sometimes) . It would come after dark and it seemed immediately after I fell asleep. I would wake up feeling as though something was staring intently at me and would open my eyes to see it outside my window. It would change shapes to the shape of the moon (half moon, crescent, full moon, etc.) and would also change colors (white, yellow, orange) . It did not have flashing colors, but would be one full color at a time. Once, it turned blood red as I reached for the phone to report it to the police as a sighting. I was scared to go to sleep and felt like no one could possibly identify with me what I was going through. I eventually saw it less and less, but did start seeing it again about 3 years ago, spurring me to pursue the hypnosis. Before the hypnosis session, I swear that I woke to a female alien standing next to my bed reaching over my abdomin area. A few hours later I woke up laying crosswise on my bed without the covers on. I also had an incident where I woke up sleep walking, chasing a very short man out of my room. I dismissed it as a dream, but after going to the bathroom to take a drink of water, I noticed that the UFO was, once again, sitting outside the window! CRAZY! A few days later, I saw the UFO in daylight gliding across the sky. It did this for a few minutes, then quickly made a right angle and dashed away. That time I could see it was cigar-shaped, not round. I was curious as to whether or not other cars driving on the highway also saw it, but I guess I'll never know. I haven't seen it for quite some time now.<br>

I saw a aqua/green bright oval shaped light, high in the sky, slowly move in the sky, stop on point, and build some type of energy (that made it even brighter brighter) around itself, or another oval behind it, because when it blasted off you could still see the other shape the energy had formed for a second but also vanished, it was like it launched off it. It took off so fast and we were left confused as to what the hell what we had just saw. It seemed to leave a quick trail of light as it blasted off.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Object leaves sky in a flash, returns in a flash and is followed by another objectOn the night of August 9, 2008, we went out for drive at 11pm in our convertible since it was so nice. We drove around Big Lake, Elk River, and the Princeton areas and ended up coming back home through Orrock through the wildlife refuge on County 9 hooking up with Cty 5 to Big Lake. When we turned south on Cty 5 a bright light caught my attention to the W moving very fast to the SE at about 40º up from the horizon. The thing peaked my interest in what I thought was a low flying jet was that there were no blinking lights on the outside of the wings or tail. There were also no steady lights on the wings, tail or body of the object, just one VERY bright light. This was also was moving at what I would estimate to be 2x the speed of a normal jet. As it reached true south of our vehicle it seemed to take a slight arching movement towards the ENE. Just as this started, I noticed the light growing dimmer. What was happening was that it was moving higher in the sky. In about 3 seconds it went from 3-4x as bright as a jet to finally vanishing. Right before it finally vanished there was a bright flash and it was gone. I kept watching the sky for a few more minutes when there was another flash and the object came back. At this point it was only the brightness of a normal satellite. When the object flew through a grouping of stars I had been watching for reference that were shaped in a triangle, one of the “stars” broke from this constant formation and started following it. During this time I had been trying to get my wife to pull over so we could watch it and possibly turn around and follow it. She had pretty much freaked out and had kept her eyes on the road the whole time and expressed she did not want to see it and was not going to be following it. I have had 2 other sightings before this and have not reported them. I heard Mr. Davenport on Binnall of America today and finally decided that this is the one I remember the most and made the most impact on me.<br>

We were sitting in the back yard enjoying a fire telling and showing my daughter the stars and sky explaining to her how big the universe is. That&#39;s when she said &quot; what is that moving fast, &quot; I looked up and saw the UFO. My wife and I have been a witnesses of a UFo incident in 1997 in northern Texas. It was very bright star, like moving in directions and speed that nothing could do on earth. I have seen almost the same siteings on the history channel etc. But what we saw tonight was camoflauge cloud like UFOS. Both the same size moving much faster than the long stratas clouds in the area. With the moon glow shinning on the small cloud like looking thing. No way was it a cloud, both were on same flight path and travaling at a much faster speed than the rest of the sky. The more I think about what I saw the more it makes since. What a better way to be discrete than taking the shape and looking like a small cloud. No lights. Just camoflage<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Three lights in a perfect triangle inched across the sky until directly above, then seemingly disappeared. We had just arrived to the summer cabin late that night, and a friend and I sat out on the porch to relax. As we were talking, I was star-gazing because it is always so much more impressive outside of the cities (of course) . I soon noticed what I thought were three stars in a perfect triangle at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon. They were inching along in the sky for about 5 minutes. These three "stars" eventually worked their way up practically directly above us in the sky, then shot simultaneously and were gone without a trace. We were both 17 at the time, and not quite sure what to make of it. I have seen a shooting star before, but never 3 in a perfect triangle moving together then shooting out of sight at the same time.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Light that appeared, hovered, and promptly disappeared with no sound emitted at all. We had just anchored the boat for some late night fishing. Within about a minute of our arrival on our favorite spot, a light became visible moving at a (relataively) slow speed. At first, it appeared to be nothing more than a bright satellite or other man made space object. But it soon became apparent that it was something more. The light grew increasingly intense, and our engine that had been running stopped abruptly. The light grew even more intense and the water and nearby forest was lit almost as brightly as it would have been during the day. The object moved across the forest and stopped, appearing to hover. All three of us were in a state of shock. The object emitted a near-blinding light. The object then proceeded slowly across the botom side of the lake and vanished just as quickly as it had appeared. We immediately left the lake and went back to our cabin. All three have sworn to silence, this is the first time that this information has been shared.! At first, I believed that this was an intense iridium flare and it only appeared to be getting closer because the diameter of the phenomenon was increasing. But I can confidently say that this was not an illusion and that the object was at a low altitude and very near to our position. A hill visible about two miles from the lake was lit up entirely so that proves that the light was in between us and the hill. I have no idea what this was. It moved swiftly, slowed and hovered momentarily, then disappeared. There was no sound that was emitted from the object, and no trail left by it. No one else that we could see was on the lake but I am sure that a few othersmust have seen it. Two aircraft were nearby, one was an unidentifiable high-flying jet. The other was a small single or dual engined propeller aircraft approximately 3-4 miles away that appeared about five minutes after the object vanished. To note: I have always dismissed stories of extra-terrestrial beings and UFOs as! irrational and ludicrous. Therefore I am not considering this! inciden t to be a visit by some green skinned alien from outer space. I Believe that this WAS however some man-made craft or some extremely rare natural phenomenon. Scenario A seems more probably because the "maneuvers" the object performed seemed crisp and defined unlike something that would be a natural occurrence. To summarize: The object first appeared to be am Iridium Flare or something of that kind. Next, the object became increaringly brighter to a pont where it was difficult to look at directly, The light was white, and white only. The object then leveld off near the lake at a low altitude; 2000 feet or less. Absolutely no sound whatsoever was emitted from the object. It then proceeded to move across the forest, and stopped near the lake. It hovered there, then moved across the southern portion of the lake. As it was in motion it disappeared in an istant. Gone, just like that. I have absolutely no explanation for this. At first it appeared to be an iridium flare, but the rest of the incident proves that it could not be. It was very low to the ground and moved silently. I follow aviation closely and know that the government produces advanced aircraft. But putting a massive light on a silent and stealthy airframe would make absolutely no sense. What in the hell could this be?<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Girlfriend and I were up in Hinckley, MN, at a friend's cabin. It was a clear sky with very little light polution and a lot of stars. I looked at a particular patch of stars and noticed an object with the same shape and brightness as a star. The object was definately on the outside of the Earth's atmosphere. We suspected that the object/craft was performing manuevers because it would travel in a straight line, the take hard, right angled turns to the right or left. On occassion, it would travel in partial circular motions and, again take hard, right angled turns. There was no way of determining the exact speed, but the fact that it was outside the Earth's atmosphere and we could notice substantial movement, we could only conclude that it was traveling at an incredible velocity. In retrospect, I should've tracked it for as long as I could, but got bored and went on to other things. [NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date is approximate. PD]<br>

We were driving down a paved road traveling toward the airport in my town. I think it was a little after 10 PM because it was dark out. As I was driving West I had to make a right. If I had turned left, this would have led me right to the front of the airport. As we took a right we traveled down another road going in a north east direction. On the right of my car was the city, the other left side was woods. As I was driving I look up, over, and to the left. Just above the tree line 30 feet feet from the road was a triangle black object. This had three lights on the bottom. When I seen this I was like "Oh my god dude a UFO!" my friend looked up and cursed from disbelief. I pulled the car over on the shoulder and shut it off, we both got out. The object was stationary in the air and made only a faint "windy" sound. I observed a regular light that was on in the cockpit. There was a guy with a helmet on reading a book or manual of some kind. (It looked to me like he was trying to figure something out about the craft) It was driven by a human for sure, but the craft was strange. Also there is a fighter pilot station at the airport less than three blocks from where we seen this object. The craft was kind of small to, it moved as slow as a helicopter and flew out of our sight slowly. [NUFORC Note: We suspect a hoaxed report here. PD]<br>

It takes off. . . it dips down and goes to the north very fast I'm still puzzled today!!! Watch the skies!!!I tell my friends about it and they look at me like I'm crazy or something.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> It was just after 10pm. and I was going to bed and I was going upstairs to my bedroom. As I got to my foyer I looked out my front door and saw what I appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on. I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also. I know this seems crazy but I truly know what I saw and maybe there is an answer. I don't know but I thought I would at least document this sighting with the first hit I got on the internet.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Possible Chinese Laterns seen in Excelsior, MN, July 4, 2008This is a follow up to the report below that I found reviewing sightings. I recall objects very similiar to these at that time. I was at the very northern tip of North Center Lake in Lindstrom, MN, watching a 2+ hr fireworks display. There were approx. 200-300 people that observed the very same thing as there were 100+ people with me on the beach and 60+ large boats in the bay. These objects were peculiar at first when we all saw them rising from the treeline straight south of us and I recall people calling them UFOs and a few even got a little nervous until them floated a couple hundred yards off to the west of us. You could visibly see outlines of the objects. They were Chinese paper lanterns. . . a lot of them, 10-12 sounds about right. They were following the same line of flight and were spaced out about a minute apart (that was the time in between sightings as they rose out of the treeline.) This sighting was out of Excelsior, which is 60 miles straight southwest of Lindstrom. EXCELSIOR, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, JULY 04, 2008, at 22:35 hrs. (CDT) A gentleman telephoned NUFORC on July 05th, 2008, to apprise us of a sighting that occurred near Minneapolis, MN, shortly after the local fireworks display. He reported that many people witnessed the event, and that it was quite dramatic in appearance. The witness is an airline pilot, with considerable experience, and he is a skilled amateur astronomer. If anyone else witnessed this display of lights, we would welcome additional reports. Full Report[NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. The report above may have merit, but we would be a bit surprised if the airline pilot, who first reported the phenomenon, could not distinguish pyrotechnic lanterns from something more dramatic. Moreover, the sighting in Lindstrom probably was not related to Chinese lanterns over Lake Minnetonka, given the 60 mile distance between the two locations. We are grateful to the individual who submitted this report. PD]<br>

A contiuous strange whistling noise lasted twenty minutes or so, like a pressure relief valve, I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. Then I noticed a Saucer in the north east about a mile, mile and a half away. Its lower section was disc-shaped silver in color, its upper section was a round flat dome with porthole lights of different colors. It was about 60 feet in circomfrence. The saucer was about 1000 feet above ground level, headed in a southerly direction about 150 mph. After 20 seconds or so I saw a fighter jet from the Air National Guard in Mpls. closing in on the saucer. The jet closed within 600 yards of the saucer, they traveled about one and a half to two miles south. The saucer then exicuted an ubrupt angle 45 degrees up and 45 degrees east turn and increased its speed 100 fold all in a blink of an eye. The fighter jet then exicuted a 180 degree bank turn to the west and headed back to the air base which brought it right over head on its return leg. The fighter jet was of a delta wing style. The jet was approximetly the same length as the saucer, 60 feet. This all took place in 3 to 4 minutes. [NUFORC Note: Date in June 1967 probably is approximate, although the source of the report does not indicate that fact. PD][NUFORC Note: Witness indicates that date is approximate. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright lights over St. Croix River/Bayport area MinnesotaDriving toward Stillwater on 1/27/10 and 1/28/10 about 8:30 pm, driving on Route 36 toward Wisconsin, noticed two bright lights similar to police helicopters with searchlights hanging in the air just above the horizon in the distance, motionless, in the distance over the next town of Bayport near the power plant, or over the St. Croix River. The first night, as we got nearer, the lights faded, one actually separated into two lights close together, one slightly higher than the other, and then both slowly got dimmer and disappeared. Last night, the second night we were driving back the same way at the same time, and the lights were visible in the same place. This time my husband and I were determined to get closer to them, so we drove down toward Bayport all the way to the river's edge, but lost them behind the trees while we were driving. The planets Mars and Saturn were clearly visible higher up in the sky, unblinking, and were not these lights. I will go! back to the spot at 8:30 pm tonight with a camera and try to photograph it if the objects are visible.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Noiseless flying Triangular craft over town. At approximately 10:10pm I stepped outdoors because I heard several Dogs that had been barking for at least 20 minutes. I looked up into the night sky because it was a clear star filled night. I then witnessed a Triangular craft that had 3 very dim lights in each corner, or maybe it reflected the City lights from below. The other thing that stood out in my mind is that it was dark, as if flying covertly. The object was traveling fast and only about 600 to 900' altitude. It was difficult for me to gage the size of it. The object made no noise at all that I could hear.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> A strange glowing / pulsating colored light was observed in the skys along with a jet that seemed to intercept itOn April 23, 2010 at approximately 1:45 AM my wife and I watched a strange light in the sky for approximately 30 minutes before it slowly disappeared.  I was working overnight in the office downstairs when my wife called me upstairs to take a look at strange light that appeared across a nature preserve that we live on behind our house.  It was a glowing, pulsating light that randomly changed colors (red, green, orange, blue) without following any particular pattern. Every so often we could make out a white jolt of light that seemed to project out from the object in random directions (quickly like lightning) . The object was brighter than anything else in the sky and mostly hovered in one spot but also moved from side to side.  At first, the light / object was large and did not seem to be very far away and I was almost sure that it was a strange type of lit up helicopter searching for something on the ground. I opened the window expecting to hear the engine! and was very surprised to find that it was dead silent outside.   I worked as a professional photographer for a few years and have all pro level equipment. I asked my wife to grab my camera (a Canon 5D digital SLR with 70-200 L 2. 8 IS lens) , tripod, and shutter release cable while I kept my eye on the light. I wanted to try to get a long exposure that showed the path of the light over time. Just as I got everything setup and settings dialed in, my newly charged batteries went completely dead.  I asked my wife to try to find some other batteries while I kept my eye on the light. As time went on, the light seemed to be dissipating and was getting smaller as if it was traveling away from us. I was also scanning the sky for anything else out of the ordinary and saw a high flying jet moving overhead. The jet turned slightly and headed DIRECTLY toward the light.  We were watching as the jet approached. My wife returned with new batteries and I took a 30 second exposure with my shutter release cable (no camera movement) with the jet approaching the light in the same frame. At this point the light was very distant and just looked like a bright star. As soon as the path of the jet overlapped and intersected the light, I expected to see the jet continue on it&#39;s trajectory, bypassing the light in the sky. I was absolutely startled when the jet disappeared completely from sight at the exact same time that it intersected the light. It was as if the pilot shut off the strobe lights at the exact same time.  There were no clouds in the sky so I&#39;m certain it did not go behind a cloud. After analyzing the image, one would tend to discredit the image since the light appears to follow the exact same trajectory as the stars as the jet is approaching. However, before the image was taken, the light was much closer, much brighter, and clearly traveled in multiple directions in the sky.<br>

<b>SHAPE:</b>  N/A<br><br>
<b>DURATION:</b>  about 20 seconds<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This was a bright, fast moving object that was in view for about 15 seconds before disappearing. At about 2225 hours on 05/08/10, my wife and I were walking with our dogs in Isanti, MN. Isanti is about 50 miles North from Minneapolis / St. Paul. We were facing east. The sky was clear and visibility was excellent. Although there were one or two aircraft in the sky, none of them were even close to the object we sighted. The object in question was very bright and would have looked like a bright star except it was moving extremely fast as compared to the aircraft we are used to seeing. Also, unlike any other aircraft, this one has no discernable navigation lights – no flashing lights, no red lights. There was just the solid bright light. We observed it for 10 or 15 seconds until it suddenly started growing dimmer and in the course of only a couple of seconds, faded out entirely. We are not claiming this to be a “UFO” in the traditional “extra-terrestrial” sense. My first guess was maybe a large military craft with afterburners or perhaps a rocket carrying a satellite. I tried looking on line and saw several websites showing scheduled launches on May 8th. One was for a dummy payload from Alaska for a test run of the Minotaur IV rocket and a military launch from Germany or France. Perhaps we saw one of those, but we were curious. Of course, if it is not, then our report is a valid one. Thanks for your time.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Two red, glowing spheres were traveling in a manner that defied the laws of gravity and left the atmosphere with unexplainable speed. My brother and I were standing on my balcony when two red, glowing spheres floated from behind the trees. They were varying their speed and stopping to hover at times. The first sphere sped up and moved ahead of the second sphere. The first sphere then stopped and hovered while the second sphere increased its speed and caught up. Once the second sphere caught up to the first it stopped and hovered. Then the first sphere shot nearly vertical at an incredible speed until it disappeared into space roughly 8 seconds later. At that time the second sphere followed with same trajectory and disappeared into space.<br>

I was outside having a cigarette break watching the storm in my backyard. I love storms - the thunder, rain, lightning. I just stare at the sky watching for lightning. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I noticed the sky started to get brighter and bluer. Just as I was thinking "huh, that's weird, " a blue ball of light soared over the clouds low over my backyard, from east to west. I didn't know it was a ball of light until it went over a part of the sky where the clouds broke up. Right after, there was lightning. I tried to think it was just part of the lightning, but the object in question didn't flash, just glowing and passed over swiftly. It didn't make any noise. It had an aura about it, and emanated light all around it, but you could tell the shape was spherical. I just sat there with my jaw dropped. I kept trying to rationalize what it was. I entertained the thought it was a meteor about to hit the earth, and sat there waiting for the ground to shake. Nothing happened, though. I stayed outside for 15-20 minutes waiting for something to happen as if to explain it. I have no idea what it was that I saw. I only know that it was an unidentified flying object.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Pyramidal-shaped Craft Over Lakeville North High School FieldOur family attended the Fourth of July fireworks show in Lakeville, Minnesota this evening. My entire family and several other people sitting around us witnessed a light brown flying object with a glowing golden ball in the center. This thing was not an airplane or firework debris, as it slowly flew across the length of the entire sky over our heads in a curved line at the same altitude. It flew from a west direction towards the east, but then curved northward, again at what appeared to be the same altitude throughout. The top of this thing spun around, and one side of it was black with something that protruded from it (you could see this black side with the protruding thing spinning slowly as it flew across the sky.) It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin. The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it. I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn't reflect light. The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery. A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it. There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by. I have never seen a ufo before, but I have never seen anything like this thing that we saw tonight. It happened at around 9pm at Lakeville North Highschool, about an hour before the fireworks began.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Twin lighted objects floating at dusk, south east of Scandia, MNObservation from Latitude 45. 27, Longitude –92. 83, 21. 00 central daylight savings time: On the night of 07/19/10, my wife and I noticed through our great room picture window two distant lights near the South East horizon, (10 degrees elevation, 45 degrees East of South) which we hadn&#39;t seen before. The first thought was they belonged to a new cell tower. Further observation with 7 x 35 binoculars showed a pair of identical objects that had red glowing vertical bodies and each with a midway ring with 4 separate green lights, (from our viewing position.) . The objects appeared on the same horizontal plane in what appeared as a stationary position. After approximately 10 minutes, the Western object&#39;s lights faded and the shadow of it&#39;s profile could be observed moving rapidly west on the same plane until out of sight. (It was twilight yet one could still discern the horizon tree line and the moving unlit object.) After another approximate 5 minutes, the Eastern object&#39;s lights faded out and it also moved rapidly west until obscured by what seemed to be clouds. Residing only 40 miles from an international airport, 15 miles from 2 municipal airports and 3 hospital heliports and at least 2 private airfields, during my past 25 years I have witnessed a number of varying aircraft servicing these facilities. The observation of 07/19/10 seems to be an anomaly from what I have previously observed. I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or other flying object turn away at night and not have at least a tail beacon. These had nothing.<br>

<b>DURATION:</b>  5 Minutes<br><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Non-blinking/non-changing orange light moving west to east. We were driving westbound on I-90 at about 11pm, when we saw an aircraft in sky. I'm sure it was probably just an ordinary airplane, but this one seemed odd, because there was no pulsation or variation of the light at all. No blinking, no change what-so-ever. It looked similar to the way a satellite looks (only considerably bigger and a different color) , but appeared to all of us to be much lower in the sky than a satellite. It seemed to be at about the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly. I'd estimate maybe only 4 or 5 thousand feet. It was a very deep unchanging orange/reddish color. It was moving the opposite direction as we were (west to east) , and was visible for about 5 minutes before it just kind of blinked out. It wasn't moving particularly fast. I'd say maybe in the 100-125mph range? Like I said, it was probably just a plane I suppose, but I live near MSP and watch planes come in and out all the time, and this was weird looking because it was just static/unchanging. It almost seemed kind of ominous. 'Maybe some sort of balloon or flare caught in a fast moving upper air flow? Who knows.<br>

The stars were initially still but then began to move in unison heading east over Lake Superior. The stars made no noise.

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bright red light moves slowly across sky, pauses in mid-air for 3 minutes and fades away into nothing. July 4, 2010, 22:40 AM My husband and I were watching fireworks from our deck when I noticed a large red light migrating horizontally across the sky. He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed. We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing. This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light) . We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer. It moved slowly across the sky. There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks. The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework. After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses. The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees. To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot. It was completely still. We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering. We probably watched it for 2-3 minutes before the light got smaller and dimmer and suddenly disappeared. It did not seem to MOVE away. It seemed like it just faded into nothingness.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Four of us saw a phenomenon of about 12 reddish lights in the late night sky south of Minneapolis, MN. We were sitting on Prior Lake looking at the sky for the brightest star in the sky. My brother-in-law died earlier this year unexpectedly and we associate that with him. Our friend then pointed out Orion's belt. Just then, as if to say hi, we saw about 5-6 reddish bigger and brighter than stars seemingly come into the atmosphere from the southeast. It didn't appear they were in any formation. There's really no telling how far away they were from us or each other. They then seemed to flatten out and slow down. Then another one and about five more spread out by a few seconds. As the others were "coming in, " the first few, and eventually all, seemed to stop and disappear towards the east. I have no idea what it was. I do know it was not a meteorite or a plane. I'd like to think it was my brother-in-law saying hi in some way.<br>

There were no flashing lights on the objects to identify them as aircraft. The objects appeared to be round in shape. I could not hear any sounds coming from the direction of the objects. The objects were moving at the speed of a jet aircraft. As the objects were moving towards the West, the first object climbed at a rapid rate of speed until out of sight. The other two objects continued moving west until fading out of sight. [NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information. PD]<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> bright string of stationary lights after tornadic storms baffles stormwatcherI was up late as I am a storm enthusiast and we had a tornado watch until 3 am. I was outside smoking a cigarette and as usual I was looking at the stars between cloud banks. I was looking due east and about a half a degree south there was a string of bright lights that seemed to blink. I at first just passed it off as an airliner coming in for landing approach as we are in the direct path of the mpls airport, (about 7 miles to the east southeast) . so we see many aircraft on a daily basis. When I was done with my cigarette I noticed that the lights did not seem to move. At that point I looked for a point of reference to see if indeed the object was stationary. I stood against the house and put my arm up at a 45 degree angle and held out my thumb horizontally so the tops of my neighbors oak trees were in sight just below my thumb, the object was an eighth of an inch above my thumb. I watched it for 40 minutes and it did not move. It looked like a string of five! stars that were very close together with the second from the left star blacked out. The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after. I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view. They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest. The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one. The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on. We see this quite often from our front yard. As It did not move and as the clouds were in front! of it I would have to guestimate that the thing was quite lar! ge and somewhat cigar shaped. side note. . . . not the first ufo I have seen.<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b> mille Lacs Lake, Garrison MN, strange orange rectangle lights seen over lake. We were sitting on the beach of mille Lacs Lake in Garrison MN, when a strange orange rectangle light came from the north going south right over the lake. Of course the beach was packed with people who were there to watch the fire works that were to be shot over the lake for the 4th of July. Many people made comments about it as it was getting closer, then it turned and looked like it was going south east but straight up into space and then it disappeared!! After the fire works show it might have been around 22:30 or later, but all of a sudden two more lights that looked the same as the first, came from the south going north. In both cases there was no sound, no blinking lights that would indicate a human flying plane or helicopter, so I am sure it was UFO's!!!<br>

They started horizontilly then went verticle. It stayed there doing that and the lights were blinking in irratic patterns, at times it seemed like 6 lights then it would just look like 4. this is no made up story, the whole block on magnolia st was filled with people watching this in the middle of the night. cops came to try and break up the crowd, they said they also had another crowd at springbrook nature center. also an unmarked car came threw and two guys in suits got out and took pictures of it. They said they did not know what it was. after about 3 hours it slowly just floated higher and higher till you couldn't see it anymore. on a side note my buddy tryed to record it! more than 10 times and all that showed up was a 20second video and 3 still photos. ther were a lot of people recording it and all that has been on the internet is a 15second crappy video on youtube. I think it looked excactly like the pheonix lights ufo in arizona (very popular video) . I take this whole thing very seriously, and I want someone to investigate it.

I saw the jet, as it passed I saw two round white objects I thought were birds; I stopped my bike to look. They both were intertwining with each other in a circular fashion, then they would move apart a little, then intertwine again as they moved south west. After a few seconds of watching, One object dimmed and then turned silver, and then disappeared. The other object went very fast to the west for a second then almost stopped and then just drifted off to the west, it did disappear at one point then reappeared. I then lost sight of it. By the way these objects were not near the jet they were probably a mile or so closer to me that the jet.<br>
