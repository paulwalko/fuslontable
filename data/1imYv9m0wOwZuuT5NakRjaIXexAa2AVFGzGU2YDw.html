<b>Tech mentions:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">Economic opportunity will not come from encouraging dependence on government programs, according to the Jan. 14 address of <b>Gov. Robert Bentley</b>. Rather, he pointed with hope to skilled jobs that will come from companies like Airbus, which is building a $600 million facility in Mobile where the company will manufacture its A320 jetliner, and a Boeing research center that will employ another 400 people. Bentley also spoke of nurturing ties to Japan’s biotech industry to help encourage its growth in the state.</a>

<b>Address date:</b> 2014-01-22<br>
<b>Tech mentions:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">With the theme of “Alaska strong,” <b>Gov. Sean Parnell</b> spent nearly half of his Jan. 22 address discussing education and called on technology to better prepare students for the future. Parnell said “our students need 21st-century classrooms to compete in a 21st-century economy” and called for continued support of the Alaska Digital Teaching Initiative, which aims to increase digital course instruction. Currently, eight school districts use video conferencing to reach remote schools throughout the state, said Parnell. Speaking about Alaska’s $12 billion pension deficit, the governor said pension payments take money from every other state program, including public safety and presumably technology initiatives as well.</a>

The governor also called on state lawmakers to reform telecommunications laws and pass legislation to give rural communities broadband Internet access that matches connection speeds found in urban areas. And Hickenlooper gave a shout-out to Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s health insurance exchange, which he said has signed up nearly 140,000 previously uninsured residents.</a>

He went on to highlight the efforts of the state’s STEM Council, which helps support effective STEM teachers.

Touting that Georgia’s workforce was ranked No. 1 by CNBC, Deal said the state must continue to identify areas of education where job placement is high. Through the Georgia’s HOPE Grant program, students in specific fields of study at technical colleges had 100 percent of their tuition paid for last year. In 2014, Deal would like that to expand to cover students studying health-care technology and IT. In addition, he is including $44.8 million in the budget to “better connect every classroom in Georgia” to the Internet and digital resources. </a>

C.L. “Butch” Otter</b> said creating a state-based health insurance exchange allowed Idaho to be the “project managers if not the architects of our own destiny.” The state continues to work through technology and policy challenges “imposed upon us by the national government and aggravated by our own early missteps,” he said. Otter proposed a $34.7 million increase in public education funding and called for greater transparency in how taxpayer investments are spent, including online reporting of that information. After discussing the need for computing devices to be accessible to students, he said the Idaho Digital Learning Academy is available to help educators learn to more effectively use devices in the classroom. In addition, he expects to have every elementary and middle school in Idaho connected to the state’s broadband education system by the end of fiscal 2015.

Quinn lauded a co-working center for digital startups, called 1871, for helping create 1,000-plus jobs and growing more than 200 companies over the last two years.

<b>Tech mentions:</b> <a href="javascript:void(0);" target="_blank">The importance of technology came through loud and clear in <b>Gov. Terry Branstad</b>’s Jan. 14 address. He first discussed the creation of the STEM advisory council, which is providing thousands of students with access to opportunities — like building robots — in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math this school year. And Iowa is getting more connected than ever: Cedar Falls is a Gigabit City and three other areas have been named Connected Communities. To further connectivity, Branstad proposed the Connect Every Iowan Act, which promotes increased access and adoption of broadband. He also called for repurposing the government-run Iowa Communications Network so that it can partner with the private sector to expand connectivity to underserved areas of the state. In addition, Branstad addressed cyberbullying by asking both Houses to support the Bully Free Iowa Act, saying that it will empower students and parents and allow schools to better address the issue.</a>
