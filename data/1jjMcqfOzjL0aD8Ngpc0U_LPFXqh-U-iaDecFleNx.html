<b>Name:</b> Opus Tower (The Break)<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Opus Group, a Rosemont, Ill.-based developer, was expected to break ground on a 17-story high-rise building at 1001 20th St. where The Break Pool Hall stands by early 2018. 
The Break hasn't been demolished yet, but the developer said the project is still happening. 

In an emailed statement to AL.com, The Opus Group said the high-rise project is still happening and is intended to be student housing for the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 

"We're currently in the planning stages of developing a student housing project in the Five Points South neighborhood," said Ben Angelo, senior director of real estate development at Opus Development Co. said. "We look forward to sharing more details as the project planning progresses."<br>
