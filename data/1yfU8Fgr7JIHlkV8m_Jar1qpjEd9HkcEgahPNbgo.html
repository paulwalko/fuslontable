<b>Arak Heavy Water Reactor</b>
<br>
Iran had been in the process of constructing a heavy water moderated research reactor at Arak, expected to be able to produce around 10kg of plutonium per year. Tehran has now committed that it will neither commission nor fuel the Arak reactor. It will also provide long-sought design information on the reactor and more frequent inspector access.

<b>Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant</b>
<br>
Located on the Gulf coast, construction began by German companies in 1975. Russian co-operation helped the plant begin <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/201194114210296626.html" target="_blank">delivering electricity</a> to the national grid by September 12, 2011, making it the first civilian nuclear power plant in the Middle East. It remains a joint venture between Tehran and Moscow.

<b>Bonab Research Centre</b>
<br>
The Atomic Energy Research Centre at Bonab is focused on applying nuclear technology to agriculture and is run by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). IAEA Director-General Hans Blix visited in 1997 and did not detect <a href="http://www.nti.org/facilities/228/" target="_blank">suspicious activity</a>. [Approximate location]

<b>Esfahan Nuclear Technology Centre</b>
<br>
Suspected to be the primary location of Iran's <a href="http://www.nti.org/facilities/237/" target="_blank">nuclear weapons programme</a>, the Nuclear Technology Centre employs thousands of scientists. The facility operates four small reactors, all supplied by China. In addition to the uranium conversion plant, the city is also reportedly the site of Iran's largest <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/esfahan.htm" target="_blank">missile assembly and production plant</a>, built with North Korean assistance.

<b>Fordow Plant</b>
<br>
Iran previously said it was moving production of uranium enriched to nearly 20 per cent to Fordow. But under the terms of the deal, Tehran has committed to leave inoperable roughly three-quarters of installed centrifuges at the site and provide daily access to IAEA inspectors.

<b>Natanz Enrichment Plant</b>
<br>
The Fuel Enrichment Plant at this site covers some 100,000 sq metres built 8m underground and fortified by double-reinforced concrete walls. Last year, there were 7,000 centrifuges, with 5,000 producing low enriched uranium (LEU). Under the deal, Iran will leave inoperable roughly half of the centrifuges and allow daily access to inspectors.

<b>Parchin Military Complex</b>
<br>
While not confirmed to be a nuclear site, the facility is believed to be a testing ground for the kind of powerful conventional explosives that could be used for nuclear weapons. IAEA tests did not reveal the presence of <a href="http://www.isisnucleariran.org/sites/detail/parchin/" target="_blank">nuclear material</a>.

Managed by the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, the center was established in 1967. Under the US <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20614/volume-614-I-8866-English.pdf" target="_blank">Atoms for Peace</a> programme, it was equipped with the 5-megawatt nuclear Tehran Research Reactor and fueled by highly enriched uranium (HEU). Argentina and Iran signed a <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201562/volume-1562-I-8865-English.pdf" target="_blank">conversion agreement</a> in 1987 and uranium delivery began in 1993.
